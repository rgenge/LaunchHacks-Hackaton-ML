MADCRACK,"Dec 12, 2020",2," This game is 90% marketing. They used all the stuff that would get people curious about the game and threw everything in their marketing, they are not even relevant features in the game.  Dense crowded and immersing world - of buggy NPCs, they de-spawn as soon as you are 5 feet away from them, they have generic behavior, generic lines and attitude, kids appear with grown up voice andThis game is 90% marketing. They used all the stuff that would get people curious about the game and threw everything in their marketing, they are not even relevant features in the game.  Dense crowded and immersing world - of buggy NPCs, they de-spawn as soon as you are 5 feet away from them, they have generic behavior, generic lines and attitude, kids appear with grown up voice and actions.  Amazing graphics - There is something so broken with this engine, I get 45 fps with High + Raytracing, it looks like next gen. If I set it to low I get 58fps and it looks like a PS3 game, like shouldn't that be higher?  Driving and Traffic - I don't even know how to get started on this, it feels like whoever did this never drove in their lives or played any game with cars for all that matters, bikes are even worse. Random cars spawn without AI so they stay in the middle of the street and **** traffic up. Pedestrians often think you are going to run over them even when you are a totally normal safe distance from the sidewalk and as a result they jump in front of your car in the middle of the street. Don't be amazed when you see a NPC running into a wall continuously.  Storytelling - This is such a boomer game, this is 2077 if you just took 1977 mentality and applied a bunch of tech on top. Storylines are so shallow and characters are just so predictable, they even use famous lines from other games and media in a bunch of quests. Quests are given to you in such a random manner, sometimes they just show up in your journal and you don't know even why.  NPC Perception - Throw a grenade near some enemy (where they don't notice) and hide before the explosion... too bad, everyone in a 5 mile radius know your exact location right now and they won't forget. Unless you move away from that spot unnoticed, suddenly no one knows where you are even without checking that you are not there anymore.  Shooting - Oh, your weapon has a equipped sigh, how about we keep the UI crosshair while you are aiming and completely not aligning with the sigh position. Oh you are aiming again, nice time to light up all objects of interest in the environment and make everything look bright blue/green and very confusing.  Character Creation - ""Look you can customize a penis, it's such a deep customization""... no, just no. You can barely customize anything, also the penis is just for you to look at in the menus. Your character is in underwear through the whole game.  Key biding - You can't change half of the key functions in the game, specially the ones that are in horrible places like I,J,K,L,O,M,N  Menu-ing - Menus are controlled by cursor, except you need keys for half of the stuff. It's pointing with mouse and clicking/holding a key to perform an action. Bonus, can't go back with mouse only... you can navigate layers deep into the menus with the mouse, then you HAVE TO use ESC to go back.  Object duplication - I lost count of how many objects just appear duplicated or without animation through the world  Corrupted Save files - happened to me twice, also game auto-saving as soon as I entered combat on accident. I just let go of the keyboard and watched my character dying again and again for half an hour.… Expand "

Nijkerk,"Dec 12, 2020",0, This game isnt even close to being finished. Buggy and game is not optimised. I7 9750H and RTX 2060 and all settings on low and sometimes the fps drops between 10-20s. Gameplay shows no inovation at all except for the visuals. I am uninstalling this game untill they patch things up. Cant recommend buying it  now.

When you press SPACE to skip the startup cutscene, it doesn't work all the time! YET with a controller it WORKS! You can't customise all your KEYBINDS!!!! (the 1996 quake classic has all the keybinds!!!!!) The game defaulted on 4k high settings, on a GODDAMN 1060. I got scared and I lowered to 1080p, yet still unplayable. The night city is simply empty. There is not much to do, and not much to invest your time in! You can't CUSTOMISE your character (after you created it)  or your car. NPC's are dumb and simply basic progammed, NO interaction at ALL. I am forcing myself to play it, but it is simply ****! I am surprised though that they didn't put denuvo on this I think the only two things that matter (not for me though) is KEANU and NVIDIA. ""we worked very close with Nvidia"" that was the red flag for me. You think you can make a game 8 years, for the ""last gen"" and shove up that **** ray tracing!?

An extremely juvenile presecence throughout that sacrifice depth for the lowest common demoninator of edge. Incredible to make a Cyberpunk game that manages to say nothing, content only to put the most surface level reads of themes into games. This is without touching on the absolute bug-ridden mess that it manages to be, somehow succeeding in beating even Bethesda when it comes to day-one jank. This alone would bring the score down but when met with repeat transphobia and dubious representation of minorities it's hard to see anything redeeming here. Every facet of the game fails to meet any form of bar from what we've come to expect over the past decade of games. Missions are shallow and monotonous. Barely any of the numeros stalls, shops and businesses are interactable with in any sense and the numerous promises of unique NPC's in this vast city fall completely flat.  A complete unredeemable mess that is most disappointing in its determination to reject any form of depth or substance.… Expand "

Sure, the game looks nice and the missions I've played so far have been very good. But that is about where the good parts end.  It amazes me that CDPR was able to make Witcher 3 and screw this up so bad. GTA V and RDR2 are leagues ahead. Even GTA:SA is better than this.  And then there is the godawful performance.  I pray that this is similar to No Man's Sky where throughout the next year or two CDPR will release updates and patches that fix this and turn it from where it is now into something much better and much more lifelike and vivid.  This game has the ability to be good, don't get me wrong. But it's gonna need a lot of hard work to get it up to where CDPR said it would be. The most ironic part of this whole thing is that if they had spent less time overhyping it and talking about features that were not feasible given the size of their team and had spent the time working on it and doing what they were capable of, this would be good. But they blew it by setting everyone's standards way higher than what they could achieve.  Overall, I think the game is good if you don't care about the open world aspect of it. The quests are definitely good, and the graphics and detail of things are next to none. If that is all you care about, then this is the game for you. If you were looking for something among the lines of GTA V x Far Cry Blood Dragon x Fallout 4, then this is not the game for you in its current state.… Expand "

As far as gameplay goes the stealth system is shallow and gunplay mechanics are dull and slippery targeting. There are precious few options for bladed weapons and shotguns early in the game. Early hacking options are only good for distractions and barely noticeable debuffs to enemies. You need a deep investing in a stat to be powerful in it, making jack of all trades characters unviable. When you add all of these factors up the first several hours of the game is a slog and you'll find yourself reloading the game often and constantly mashing the inhaler to heal yourself.  And then there are the quality of life issues. in spite of the amazing character customization options you will only see your character in mirrors, photo mode, and the inventory screen. There are no third person cutscenes. Dialog options are stilted and often pigeonhole you into being a jerk, even to characters who are presented as sympathetic people. The game decides who V likes and who V doesn't like and if you have a different opinion you can basically shove it. You can't preview gear before buying it and some of the gear is just ugly.  Finally, there are the freezes and game crashes that happen at least hourly on the XBox version. I'm playing on the XBox One X and can only imagine that performance is much worse on the base system.  This game was in development for years for what is now considered ""last gen"" consoles and it's painfully obvious that the 3 week delay to better optimize for consoles didn't get the job done. I'd rather wait another year for this game than play it as is. Hopefully CD Projekt Red patches the issues soon, but right now I have a game that's equal parts frustration and enjoyment.… Expand "

Honestly the list is endless. This is not about hating the game. I wanted it to be great like anyone else. I think it has the potential to be great. The foundation, the vision and the ambition is there and you can see glimpses of it and feel it throughout the city but the issues this game has far outshine the good things (like the characters, story telling, general atmosphere/vibe within the city, style). This really feels like a beta or early access version and not a finished product with how buggy, glitchy and janky it is. You can still have some fun with it sure, but is this the legendary game they where selling? Hell, even if you didn't buy into the hype, the state this game was released in is unacceptable. How are so many people okay with an obviously unfinished product is beyond me and all those payed high score reviews are just pitiful.  I am deeply disappointed in CDPR. I am sure, I know some of these developers worked their asses of and where really passioned with this project and like I said, you can see the ambition within the world but ultimately where powerless against the will of the suits to push this game out far far to early. Just imagine what would have been possible with one or even two more years of development.

But the tech aspect could be fixed, right? Yeah, sure, but the gameplay...  Let's start with intros. Corpo intro is bad. So bad in fact, that I was genuenly shocked when it ended.  But it gets worse from that point. Most gameplay parts are, well, not very satisfying or in-depth as was advertised/teased! Driving is atroceous on PC. Gunplay is mediocre at best. Stealth and hacking are okay, but nothing new, really.  And on top of that - AI is glitchy and dumb. And on top of THAT - UI.  Good god - world map is terrible, navigation between menues is badly executed.  Yes, they can fix tech issues.  Probably tweak the AI and UI, but what will they do with the gameplay?

Not to mention the character creator itself is extremely boring and limited.  Gunplay: The gunplay is simply awful. Not the animations themselves but the sensitivity and feel of it. There is no way to make it good, I tried everything. Deadzone, Acceleration, Zoom sensitivity, etc. Nothing worked. The only option is to play on a very low sensitivity if you want any chance of hitting anything.  Environment: This is the least ""cyberpunk"" game I have ever played also which is ironic considering the name. If you want the cyberpunk experience, play Deus X, this is absolute garbage. Most of it is just people looking like modern liberals, it's supposed to be 2077 not the current year.  Voice Acting: Horrible. I used the male voice and his voice acting is absolutely atrocious. His voice does not sound natural and all the the more you listen to it the more annoying it gets. Maybe the female is better, but I doubt it. She's probably just going to sound snarky and annoying.  Marketing: The irony of this game is that it's about a future capitalist society where people would do anything to make a buck, and that's exactly what CDPR did with their marketing. They lied, their game looks nothing like the cinematics in the trailers. They clearly spend 200+ million marketing this game and much less on actually making it. Their studio has over 1,000 people, there is no reason for the game to be in the state it is. What's even more insulting is that they had DLC prepared before launch that they did not put in the game. They made that rather than optimizing the experience, pathetic.  Story: Notice how nobody is going around dropping story spoilers to troll people? That's because there is nothing to spoil. It's boring, uninspired, it doesn't take chances. The main story is only 15 hours long on top of that and the side missions are extremely overhyped.  Graphics: There are many graphical issues, having certain settings on will cause the game to crash, etc. It's fine overall, not a deal breaker although I personally care more about the substance than the graphics so maybe this matters more to you.  Driving: Extremely very bad. Doesn't feel natural at all, the car feels very light.  Cyberpunk 2077 is not even the best game this year, it isn't even in the top 10 games this year.

Misleading marketing, scripted, pre-rendered trailers led to out of control hype. Mediocre character design, lackluster gun play, horrendous driving, a lifeless world with no activities to keep you entertained outside of story missions, a seemingly dazzling city from a far  - up close an empty husk, a paper city, hidden behind ""locked doors"" everywhere.  Without a doubt one of the worst AI's in gaming history - NPC's dont have driving AI, everything is  moving on rails, completely ignoring you, both on foot and car. Missions are linear and scripted and can be passed literally without touching  your computer once, making firing at enemies pointless in some missions. Police spawns next you after a crime and does not attempt to chase you (because of nonexistent AI). All 3 career options do not have a significant difference. Romances are pointless and boring. Technically the game is a mess - alpha level build bugs, glitches and performance issues plague the game, making in unplayable on anything different than a $10 000  PC. Huge chunks of the game are missing as evident by the rail tracks scattered around the map while game options such as the ""metro system"" are removed, as well as building scaling and drone controlling (as in first gameplay trailer with spider bot). To me this is evident of a disastrous and confusing development as if game devs themselves had no idea what to do... Game has some potential but that would require fundamentally redesigning core elements of the game which, i fear, would never happen, or would take at minimum 1-2 years.

It sets up the tone perfectly. The characters and their writing and voice acting is superb. Easily my favorite part of the game.  This game lacks serious core gameplay mechanics. Everything from the Gear system, customization, the quickhacking, the character progress through skill trees etc. Everything is so incredibly lackluster. It feels as if they only put the bare minimum of work into these major factors.  I finished the game at around level 27. I did the major side quests and a few things here and there. 70%, if not more of the skill tree is left unexplored for me because of how hard it is to level. You really have to grind side activities to get that skill tree going. A lot of the skill tree is uninteresting though.  Same goes with the weapons. I mostly stuck to playing revolver with a silencer and a sniper or something as a main weapon. I wasn't a fan of the tech or smart technology.  Quickhacks felt meaningless. Didn't see a point in them when I could just take out dozens of enemies in stealth with my revolver alone. Even watch dogs did this better and if Ubisoft did something better than you.. well sorry to say but you messed up.  I could go on and talk about the atrocious AI and the non existent traffic/police system. But enough people have already done that.  I don't know what went wrong with this game. It really shouldn't have been released for another year at least. Sorting out all the bugs and fleshing out the system more would have made this game so so much better.

Even though it's hard to set those aside because, once I realized how aggressively disappointing the game would be, it left a sour taste in my mouth.  This just isn't a very good game, period.  It's not a rich and engrossing world. Much of it is closed off or locked to you. The NPC's are scripted and cannot be engaged beyond a line of dialogue. The combat is *clunky.* The game just isn't fun, it doesn't handle well.  The technical glitches are severe. Police spawn right behind you (even when you're up on a random ledge somewhere, ha). Gamebreaking bugs abound. Missing textures, faces. NPC's vanishing as they walk away from you. Etc. Etc.  Were this to come from an indie dev, it would be worth defending. (Kingdom Come: Deliverance had a lot of issues, too). But this was in development for a decade. 500 people, apparently, worked on this. Feels like 12.  The most disturbing aspect of all of this is the gaming media's shameless complicity in cheerleading this half-baked, mediocre release. At least CD Projekt Red is expected to over-hype their game. It's journalists who are nominally the ones to challenge corporate hyperbole. Not defend it!… Expand "
jdh5153,"Dec 12, 2020",1," One of the worst AAA games I’ve ever played. Graphics are bad, bugs are all over the place, the writing sucks and nothing even matters, the life paths are a farce. Everything is all dressing no substance. Nothing matters. The driving is like from a PS2 game. You can’t interact with anyone or anything in the city. "
Pusichka,"Dec 13, 2020",4," I was deceived. this is not the game that was shown in the trailers. it would be better if all the millions spent on marketing would be spent on programmers. would invest better in game development. the graphics are terrible, the game does not work well on powerful video cards, and the textures are of poor quality. if you briefly describe the graphics, you get: 1) soap 2) poor qualityI was deceived. this is not the game that was shown in the trailers. it would be better if all the millions spent on marketing would be spent on programmers. would invest better in game development. the graphics are terrible, the game does not work well on powerful video cards, and the textures are of poor quality. if you briefly describe the graphics, you get: 1) soap 2) poor quality textures 3) blueness in lighting 4) plastic graphics. In general, the graphics are very much like fallout 4 for me (if you look closely at the textures). at the end of 2020, the ""new generation"" game has no reflections in mirrors on computers. a shame. the city is trying to seem alive, but in fact it is dead, heavily scripted (very limited). he is only in the role of scenery. Damage numbers flying away from the enemy greatly enrage. highlighting opponents is also annoying. it feels like another grind game from yubisoft. The cars are simply uncontrollable! why they added options to the dialogues is also unclear, they rarely affect something. it's an illusion of choice for the most part. little entertainment in the city (for me). in gta more. there is nothing to do, except for side missions, the scenario of which is: ""bring, take away, shoot someone."" the Russian voice acting, especially the female voice, is just awful. the game gives the impression of being unfinished, this is a paid early access. The plot is extremely dull (for me). For some reason, they added the ability to attach male eggs to women, but for me this is just stupidity. It would be better if the bugs were fixed. In short, I'm tired of writing. this game was clearly not made for 8 years, but 3. All expectations of a good open world and storyline completely failed. It's just an average game, but why it was necessary to make such a stir around it I don't understand. If the deus ex human revolution of 2011 had an open world, then this game would be better than cyberpunk 2077 in 2020, with slightly worse graphics. меня обманули. это не та игра, которую показывали в трейлерах. лучше бы все миллионы, потраченные на маркетинг, потратили бы на программистов. вложили бы лучше в разработку игры. графика ужасна, игра плохо работает на мощных видеокартах, при этом текстуры плохого качества. если кратко описать графику, то получиться: 1) мыло  2)плохое качество текстур 3)голубизна в освещении 4) пластмассовая графика. Вообще графика очень сильно для меня напоминает fallout 4 (если близко разглядывать текстуры) . в конце 2020 года в игре ""нового поколения"" нет отражений в зеркалах на компьютерах. позор. город пытается казаться живым, но на самом деле он мёртвый, сильно заскриптованный (сильно ограниченный). он лишь в роли декораций. цифры урона, отлетающие от противника, сильно бесят. подсвечивание противников тоже раздражает. такое чувство, что это очередная grind игра от юбисофт. Автомобили просто неуправляемые! зачем они добавили варианты ответов диалогах тоже непонятно, они редко на что то влияют. это иллюзия выбора по большей части. мало развлечений в городе (для меня). в гта больше. там нечего делать, кроме побочных миссий, сценарий которых: ""принеси, унеси, застрели кого нибудь"". русская озвучка, особенно женский голос, просто ужасна. игра создаёт впечатление недоделанности, это платный ранний доступ.

If it was just the bugs, I wouldn't have cared. This game is horrible in every way. I thought it would be somewhat like GTA 5 or Borderlands, which has snappy, smart and funny dialogue/characters/cutscenes, instead, it's like watching a TV show so bad you're not able to watch it, it has nothing but dumb, superficial and unrealistic dialogue meant to sound ""cool and casual"". It's like a 15 year old wrote it to convince his mom he's a sci-fi author, and this 15 year old adapted it to sound appropriate to braindead corporate managers judging if it's good enough to pass as dialogue. The voices are also pitched low to make everything that's said sound like in a war movie the whole time, ""we're so badass we can't help ourselves having this whiskey voice"".  The ""hacking"" stuff is even dumber than that. It's unecessary and tacky, it's ridiculous. It's like a B-movie in which the main character has a ""hacker"" on his side that ""hacks"" the ""CIA mainframe"" in a few seconds because he's such an awesome hacker. It's like a 70 year old CEO who needs help to print a Word document decided ""this feels like sci-fi"". Some of the hacking turns into a minigame in which you click numbers on the right side of the screen identical to numbers on the left side of the screen, which is a brain-numbing, pointless waste of time, it's literally something a three year old could do, but if it was more difficult, it would be even more annoying, it's something that shouldn't be in the game, it's basically a punch in the face as to how unrealistic and stupid the game is.  Then there's the gameplay. I thought, ""OK, this is a horrible game, but with the reviews in mind, the combat has to make up for it"". The combat is slow, choppy and annoying and has you headshot people 5-10 times and they're still alive, and they're not bosses that are supposed to be hard to kill. They walk around slowly as if nothing's happening, like they're mingling at a barbeque, they're like sitting ducks that has to be shot 20 times. It doesn't feel like they're a threat, you can just arbitrarily take cover now and then to let the game justify that you survive. This is not ""gaming console sickness"", lots of console games has a million times better combat than this. Almost all of them, actually. It made me remember what it was like to play ""Robocop"" on the Commodore 64.  The graphics engine must be horribly badly made, I'm on a new $8000 dollar computer with the best Nvidia Geforce video card and the framerate is horrible. Having looked around in the bathroom where the game begins, I exited the game, stripped down Windows and updated the drivers just in case. It didn't help. Then I read on the internet about frequent framerate drops and a lot of other people having much bigger problems than me.  The stealth training session was an assurance that whole deal of sneaking around throughout the rest of the game will feel like a pointless and constantly annoying exercise. You can walk by a guard right in front of him at a distance of, like, 4 meters, and he can't see you if you duck down while you do it. There is, believe it or not, lots of other fantastically stupid things I could've brought up. Considering what judgements can be made about the people who made this game, it's certain there's not gonna be any redeeming features throughout the game. It's not suddenly going to start to get better later in the game. In a small way, it's like I knew that the moment I had to click ""Breach"" instead of ""Ok"" when I started the game, what... stupid... idiot... switched out ""ok"" with ""breach"" just because ""breach"" is a word used in relation to hacking? In conclusion: This is the worst game I've played and I was suckered into buying it by reviewers I'm never gonna trust the rest of my life. Since they all praised this game in unison, it's 100% clear now there must be some kind of system with kickbacks that rewards good reviews. I've asked Steam for a refund and there will be no place on this Earth for them to hide if I don't get it.… Expand "

They drive in pathways that are painfully obvious and simply stop whenever there are any obstacles. Almost everything can be cheesed with stealth and de-aggroing.    Many simple objects like chairs and machines are inaccessible, not even allowing for the player to participate in the world unless given a prompt from a mission. The immersion is just not there.

Sure withThis release is an AUDACITY! What we got here is a TECH DEMO, but not a real $60 game. It is UNFINISHED and everyone giving this a rating above 6/10 has either played it for less than an hour or simply is lying. The overhyping did it a serious disservice as CD Projekt Red did NOT deliver what they promised.  1) Being a next-gen benchmark game: CP2077 *fails* in this category. Sure with the ray-tracing on and ignoring the bugs and some butt-ugly NPC character models it looks very good (but not great!), I got serious BLADE RUNNER vibes, but unfortunately the gameplay mechanics are anything but next gen: we've seen it all before in other games and mostly better! - Stealth is bare bones and works like every other stealth game - Shooting is as basic as it can get and enemies are bullet sponges. Think FALLOUT 3 shooting but without VATS - Crafting/dismantling/looting is all here, all as we are used to. You can loot anything even in plain sight of the owner, they won't mind (socialism has won in the NUSA). The typical hunt for DPS weapons and armor class items, shoot, loot, equip or sell/discard - the open world looks good but nothing ground-breakingly new here either: several symbols indicate side quests, there's your GPS and quest markers and onscreen prompts of what to do when you reach your destination. Here it does make sense with all the implants, but next gen? Nope. - basic leveling as we are used to as well. Level stats and pick perks. It's been done in overabundance even by Ubisoft titles.  2) controls! They are horrible. Mainly driving - which you will be doing a lot. If you try to go with first person view driving (for immersion) visibility is almost zero, drive up a ledge, you won't see anything. Braking takes about a mile (not joking) to a complete stop at 100mph. Turning in a curve feels like driving a tank rather than a car, while being a passenger turning in a curve feels like a person turning rather than a car. Traction is horrible, expect to plow through the sidewalks and hit everything left and right of you. FAR CRY 5 & GTA 5 did it much better. This is easily the worst driving mechanic in ANY game I have ever played.  3) Alive open world: EPIC FAIL. Stealing (looting) goes unpunished. Kill somebody, cops will just pop up behind (!) you and kill you. No options to surrender or bribe your way out of it. NPCs are numerous but dumb: some are literally glued to a spot day and night, others will pop in, walk down a road and fade out again, using the same throwaway line over and over when you try to interact with them. Vehicle operators are just as braindead: Park a car in the middle of the road will cause a roadblock with them patiently waiting for you to move your vehicle. Traffic lights for player are ALWAYS green. Don't expect patrolling cops like in GTA 5 or SAINT's ROW, you will see randomly spawning in crime scenes or when you kill somebody (or run over somebody when you try to drive a vehicle) they will just pop in to kill you. The wanted system is terrible: you can easily run/drive away (I prefer to run, since driving is a catastrophe), break line of sight for 10 seconds and all is forgiven & forgotten. Cops cannot operate vehicles. The CYBERPUNK world is devoid of life.  4) Decisions and consequences: Again a FAIL. Multiple options to solve a quest exist by dialogue, sneaking or killing, but it's just as basic as we've seen in games like SKYRIM before. I felt THE WITCHER 3 had more options, more paths and more interesting choices and impacts, here it only affects how much cash reward you get occasionally. The story wasn't really all that gripping either and the ""origins"" prologue lasts for about 15-20 minutes each. Here they definitely could have been done much more as there are only 3 life paths! This is a wasted opportunity.  5) Cut Content & 2018 Demo comparison. Several elements that were promised in pre-production were cut in the final release. Things like 3rd person cut scenes, metro rides, wall climbing, corrupt cops. I also think the 2018 demo version looked much better, not as overly bright, HUD of cars, character models in general. The downgrading of the graphics is not on an epic (negative) scale as in WITCHER 3, but still noticeable. Several storylines feel cut as well. It seems the entire wanted system was implemented 5 minutes before the game was rushed out the door and it is very apparent that they thought ""well, it's better than nothing?!""  I am sorry to have to say CP 2077 looks good(ish) and can be fun while it is new and the illusion lasts, but will fall apart quickly after you've explored most of Night City. After a few hours I felt like doing something else rather than playing CP 2077, that is bad for a $60 game. Dont even THINK of mentioning CYBERPUNK 2077 and GOTY in the same sentence! 1995's TekWar had a better Open World (and that game was CRAP!!).… Expand "

In a world where you can upgrade your body parts, there isn't even a place to get your hair cut, let alone a restaurant to get bite to eat. Almost every part of this game has been done better by other games released years in the past.  Abysmal optimization and framerates, game-breaking glitches, and frequent crashes plague Cyberpunk 2077. Feels like an incomplete game. The current state feels like an alpha build that is being sold for $60. Seriously, what were the developers doing for the past 8 years of development. 3 delays? It is criminal to release a AAA game in this state for full price.  There are few RPG elements and your choices have little impact on the story. All 3 paths you choose at the beginning of the game lead to you becoming a street rat eventually. For Corpo, it's about 30 minutes. The story is at least somewhat interesting, and the cutscenes look nice. Perhaps this game should have been a graphic novel.  Final verdict: Do not buy. Wait at least a year for the glitches and optimization to be fixed, if at all. Cyberpunk 2077 brings nothing new to the table and you are better off spending your money elsewhere.… Expand "

I believe the great majority of these bugs will be fixed within the next few months via patches.Needless to say, this is one of the best games of all time. CD Projekt Red has done it again, and has set a new standard for RPG’s. The game is filled to the brink with content. Countless side missions that are so detailed, you sometimes need a reminder that it’s a side mission and not a story mission. The story follows V a mercenary for hire who works his way up the underworld ladder of Night City. How you go about that is entirely up to you, and similarly to Witcher 3, the choices you make greatly impact the story and the world around you. The weapons are next-level badass, as you slice and dice limbs off your enemies with Katanas, blow them away with “Smart”… Expand "

I'm not giving it a zero purely based on the sheer effort the artists put in; they really, really tried to make the game feel less lifeless and make locations interesting.  Unfortunately, more often than not, the art just illustrated how hollow the rest of it was.  Bland characters; you can ""pet the dog"" but you can't sit down at a bar and talk to people.  Lots of random conversations to be heard, but very few meaningful ones.  Fallout 1, this ain't.  Forget the Day One bugs and unplayable levels of performance issues.

I'm extremely disappointed by the way this game runs on my computer. To make matters worse: lots of bugs, both of visual and audio nature are regularly encountered.  The story is great and the characters are very interesting. A lot of effort was clearly put into facial animation and realistic movement. The environments and aesthetics have clearly received a ton of work and careful thought. They are extremely impressive. The combat is passable but stealth and hacking leave a lot to be desired. There exists a great framework to build from, but it seems like this game needed another 6-7 months of further development and refinement. I've enjoyed my time so far, but have been left feeling a bit disappointed in many respects.  The biggest letdown for me personally is the way the world reacts to the player character. NPC AI is incredibly shallow and doesn't really engage with the player character out in the world. This leaves the gameplay feeling much more hollow than was advertised. The AI drivers don't avoid the player or drive around. 95% of shops and kiosks have no interactivity and pedestrians may as well be not there.  This game feels empty outside of the main quests, which to their credit, are really fun. Don't go into this game expecting a deep experience, I have found it to be the opposite overall. 6/10 -> a passable, satisfactory experience.… Expand "

I just like SC-FI , Deus Ex games and I have always been intrigued by Cyberpunk 2077  For me this game is up there with GTA5, RDR2, Witcher3 and Mass Effect. Games that I consider the best of the best. The game grabs attention with its gritty, dark and rough world of Cyberpunk. The game music composer Marcin Przybyłowicz is absolute virtuoso. His music will stay with me for a very long time.  I have spent over 150 hours playing this game and the more I play it the more I like it. The game is absolute behemoth because there is just so much to do in there.  I have read here and watched some YouTube videos with people complaining about AI in Cyberpunk but to me there is not much difference between AI in this game and Witcher 3.  Yes there are some weird stuff here and there but I think this has to do more with being a bug than being a bad AI. People complain about driving mechanics saying that they are somewhat not as good as in GTA5 but I see no difference.  To me some people just had such unrealistic expectations about this game that now they cannot enjoy this really solid AAA title.  The game story is interesting. There are moments in my first 15 hours which surprised me and I thought to myself ""wow, this is very cool stuff"".  From technical point of view this is state of the art with cutting edge visuals that requires latest RTX and RX hardware to experience it to the fullest.  It seems to me that there are some people are really sore that their hardware cannot handle the game as they expected. To them I will say tough luck. You want next gen visuals and smooth frame rates then it is time to upgrade to next gen hardware.  The game needs good hardware to enjoy the visuals to the fullest. This game made me upgrade my PC from AMD 3600 / 5500Xt 8GB to AMD 5800x / 3060Ti.  Red Dead Redemption 2 should have been wake up for all of us. it is going to get tougher on old hardware in next few years as developers will spend more time developing games for the latest PC hardware and new consoles. There are some bugs in the game and again some people just over dramatize saying that the game is ""infested"" with bugs. This is simply not true.  I am 80 hours in the game and I have encountered few bugs like people walking through walls or some people standing on top of a car but nothing that I would consider major. Nonetheless it would be great to see CDPR to address those issues.  In summery Cyberpunk is good game. It is solid 9 out of 10 for me and I will be glad to bump up the score to 10 once the bugs are fixed and AI is improved.  Cyberpunk 2077 is another special gem from CD Projekt Red.  I am looking forward to explore Night City with my first character and then replay it again and experience the game with other characters and do everything that this game has to offer.… Expand "

Side activities are for one hoof. How many times can I embrace the same robberies, which in total are always limited to one - killing everyone in a given area. No mini-games or other activities. The witcher had a Gwent at least, but here's what? Even Ubisoft made a fake and made an Orlog in Valhalla. The game world is very nice, but so what if it seems quite artificial and not very interactive, and it is a lot lacking in terms of GTA. The NPCs in the streets are just moving mockups. There is zero interaction with them. If you approach them, they will say two words and that's it, you can't even push them, which compared to RDR2 is a shame. There, even if one got stuck for too long, he could get pissed off and tried to stab us with a knife. Even older parts of GTA had greater interaction with them. Cars drive to drive. You'll get in the way, the traffic will stop and that's it. Neither will anyone try to avoid you, nor will anyone sound the horn. Shooting is there because it is. It is not fun at all that you are shooting at something. AI is blunt like no matter what. The opponents in AC at CP are geniuses. Cyberpunk will be one of those games that will kill overly drugged marketing and promises of something we never got or won't get because the game was kicked so early that even patch 3.10 won't fix it. CDP Red should be ashamed, because they have wasted their reputation in the world, which they have built up thanks to The Witcher, and the hate that has been poured out on foreign forums is beyond control. The game should be released in six months, but you can see the cash was more important, and the CEOs and investors wanted to hit it as soon as possible instead of taking care of the reputation of the company, which was often considered a model in the world of how to approach the game and the client. In fact, I do not even feel sorry for them, because in the current state this game should not be released (especially on consoles) and the marketing and all promises, to put it mildly, turned out to be ""slightly"" stretched for me. I believe that the head of CD-Projekt deserves a very hard spanking because he is blinded by pride. The Witcher 2-3 success hit the CDPR boss to the head and should learn a lesson to bring to earth. Even story is not just good and as previous CDPR games overtalked - good that cutscence is not directed like in W3: in which director thought that he was Kojima etc. and he thought that he knows and can how to direct good cutscence like some kind of movie.… Expand "

In my opinion, they got to 2018 and saw they weren't able to deliver the things they promised with their engine. Instead of shifting or retooling the engine, they decided they'd go hire a big voice actor that is popular in the genre and rewrite the entire game. I wish I had some actual details for behind the scenes, and maybe they will come out some day, but I have a strong gut feeling that this is pretty much what occurred.

Since the character creation I was concerned about how limited the options there were. There is no body edition, and face consist on preset pieces, without adjustable sliders. The result looks good, though. Beards are the only category where I think they did more than any other game I've played. Everything else is inferior.  Gameplay can be summarized like I started: it's a futurist GTA. That isn't necessary a bad thing for everyone, but it is for me. Gunplay, melee combat and driving feel 90% the same. Melee combat feels so imprecise, unnatural... Hacking during combat is the only little difference, but it's so chaotic.... You'll probably only use hacks to distract someone when in stealth, that's it.  First person view is probably the worst idea they had when they starting developing this game. It makes melee combat irrelevant, it makes moving fast annoying, and it adds ZERO to immersion. V has a fixed personality that you might like or not, so why I'm supposed to be forced to look through his eyes? To feel like him? I rather see him all the time in a third person view so I can enjoy him as a character, how I made him look and the clothes I chose for him. But the only way to do so is in the menu, since you won't see your character when playing. The result has the opposite effect to immersion: now you don't care for V or the way he looks. You are just looking at a screen.  I've also heard the word ""verticality"" a lot when talking about this game. How the city was big, not as big as other videogame maps, but verticality made it the biggest map ever made. Folks, I haven't seen any verticality when playing this game. There has to be something more about it, but in general every door will be closed, every building is just a map decoration and you won't enter if it's not plot-related. Streets are filled with NPCs in a very realistic way, but they can't be interacted.  I don't think this is a bad game. But definitely not a game I should have bought. It doesn't really add anything new to the table, and what it does doesn't shine or is poorly executed.… Expand "

They are all 10/10s in their own rights, but Cyberpunk 2077 is very different in some respects and also very similar. CDPR is probably one of the only AAA devs that care about making a narrative driven world with incredible characters and an A+ story. Cyberpunk definitely delivers in this regards, I'm a little over 20 hours in and the Main Quests, Side Quests, and characters are just what I was expecting from the writing team. Once we dive deeper in, however, we start to notice cracks. Yes, there are bugs... a lot of bugs. I'm playing on a higher end PC so i've only experienced a handful (none of them game breaking) but I acknowledge the fact that some PC and console players are having a difficult time getting into the game because of all the bugs. Honestly, this was the case with The Witcher 3's launch. The only difference is that our standards for videogames have gone up some. When we buy a game, we expect it to be finished. Despite this, I have no doubt that CDPR will fix this game over the next few months to make the game that they want. With that said, the launch is pretty disappointing.  But I'm not disappointed with the actual game by any means. The game I'm playing is the one that I expected and hoped for. I wasn't expecting a fully dynamic city where each NPC has unscripted routines and personalities (i've learnt from Bethesda that stuff like that just wont happen). I wasn't expecting incredible gun play that would revolutionize all of gaming. I wasn't expecting driving mechanics that top GTA or an open world feel that could rival RD2.

Predator1480,"Dec 12, 2020",0," First off I would say game has great world design, great music and that's all I can think of Pros the open world has alot of NPCs but still feels lifeless and boring. The characters are really uninteresting compared to game like Witcher 3, the combat is ok nothing revolutionary  overall this game is a mix of GTA and Fallout  but dont expect a life changing  experience  you will be disappointed "
lpjakewolfskin,"Dec 11, 2020",3, I’ve waited this game for years.But I’ve got another game full of bugs and with bad optimization... 
Jonee02,"Dec 11, 2020",4," Cyberpunk doesn’t bring anything new to the table as far as the RPG genre goes, it plays as a mix between Fallout and Borderlands. Since Cyberpunk is an FPS at heart, its needs solid gunplay, which it has. Guns feel good and combat is somewhat smooth, though subpar AI and the lack of a true cover system means fights generally delve quickly into brawls rather than tactical combat.Cyberpunk doesn’t bring anything new to the table as far as the RPG genre goes, it plays as a mix between Fallout and Borderlands. Since Cyberpunk is an FPS at heart, its needs solid gunplay, which it has. Guns feel good and combat is somewhat smooth, though subpar AI and the lack of a true cover system means fights generally delve quickly into brawls rather than tactical combat. Quickhacks add something to combat, though in the early game, not a lot – and probably not a lot without investment. Fallout elements come in the form dialogue trees and picking up EVERYTHING you see, and Borderlands elements from the many guns that drop. With no access to quick menus, you’ll be doing a lot of game pausing to check for stats and minor 1% upgrades. Oh, and with no glamour system, you’re going to be wearing ugly gear just because of the raw stats.As for the RPG elements, Cyberpunk seems to follow most RPG dialogue choices – except you get the strange feeling of being on rails. There’s a lot of expanded dialogue which gives more exposition but only one choice which progresses the story. During missions there are a few optional objectives, though how much they change the way missions unfold remains to be seen.Now on to the negatives. There’s a lot. The first negative you’ll come across is the character creator. It’s woeful. People are so focused on CDPR's genital obsession they’re overlooking how poor the character creation is. First of all, there’s a green tint lighting which means your V will inevitably look different in-game. Secondly, options rather than sliders. Every character creator needs sliders in 2020. Nobody is expecting BDO levels of customization but Cyberpunk's is as basic as it gets – and there’s no altering your character after creation which is a cardinal sin.Second negative is the driving. You’ll be doing a lot of it. It’s bad. Feels terrible. Thirdly, manual saves in games is so outdated, I shouldn’t need to open my pause menu everytime I want to do something. It should quick save on literally everything you do, pick up a rare weapon? Should quicksave. Start a mission? Should quicksave. Quite frankly the checkpoint system is atrocious. And finally the bugs. Oh dear god the bugs. In 8 ours of gameplay I’ve had 3 hard crashes, 2 soft crashes which required restarts, 6 video recorded bugs I’ve sent to friends, unresponsive AI, menus not working and so on.Thanks for coming to my TedTalk.… Expand "

The patch hasn't improved the situation much yet - You need to get used to driving cars - Sometimes scripts break, it is fixed by rebooting, therefore I advise you to use quick save more often. - There are minor visual bugs, AI characters and animations sometimes break - The interface of the game is inconvenient for me personally But, I definitely recommend the game for purchase, the flaws will soon be corrected with patches.

Ой, а не кажется ли вам, что 6.5 баллов для игры от польских мессий геймдева, солнцеликих, светозарных, гениальных СидипрожектРЕД - маловато? Маловато, но объективно, сама игра слабая, даже если не смотреть на все технические проблемы. Отвратительная боевая система: оружие вроде бахает терпимо, но реакции на попадания, в лучшем случае, потешные, а зачастую просто отсутствуют. От выстрела с ружья в лицо неписи просто смешно падают, потом встают и.. тупят дальше. Да, НПЦ в бою тут тупят, а не воюют. Тут мы переходим к следующей проблеме - убогий ИИ болванчиков. Они ведут себя нелогично, ни о каких обходах игрока с флангов и речи не идет, попадают лишь в упор, если игрок стоит прямо в чистом поле: стоит спрятаться за укрытие - ты в домике и неуязвим, штурмовать тебя не станут. Милишная боевка радует не больше из-за плохих, дерганных анимаций. Никаких следов от ударов на врагах я не заметил, как, допустим, в РДР2.. или в хрониках риддика из 2004 года, хех. Другая причина для расстройства, вгоняющая в тоску и уныние - взаимодействие с окружающим миром. Он просто картонный, насквозь искуственный, безжизненный. С мирными неписями/толпой/массовкой нельзя сделать ничего. Они не реагируют на твое тело, ты или просто пролетаешь сквозь них, как бесплотный дух, либо сам отлетаешь от них, если пытаешься протаранить в прыжке. Ты можешь запрыгнуть сидящим в баре людям на стол - они даже не дрогнут, никак не прокомментируют это, не дадут тебе леща. Со стола не слетят бутылки и плохо прорисованные яства, по которым прошлись (к удивлению!) вполне неплохо сделанные ноги ГГ. Единственная реакция НПЦ в этом мире на игрока - сесть на корточки и кричать, если где-то неподалеку перестрелка. Порой они устраивают целые массовые посиделки, сбиваясь в огромные кучи. В рдр овцы умнее были, хех. А если мирного жителя, не дай бог, зацепить гранатой или шальной пулей в перестрелке - буквально из заднего прохода главгероя появится карательный отряд полиции и выпилит игрока за секунду. Машины ездят интересно, имеют какую-никакую модель повреждения, немногим лучше второго андеграунда, но все впечатления от езды портятся взаимодействием с другими водятлами, которых ты просто сносишь, будто это резиновые мячики. ИЗ лобовых стекол не вылетают водители, даже при самых диких авариях, с мотоцикла главгерой не слетит ни при каких обстоятельствах, хоть ты на скорости 170 впечатаешься в стену. Ладно, я устал ругать игру, считайте что в остальном она хотя бы неплоха. Но при всех неупомянутых достоинствах она ощущается очередной поделкой от юбисофт, а не игрой за 300к зелени от спасителей игропрома.… Expand "

These game in current state runs smoother than just about anything else I've ran performance wise and I'm getting a smooth stable 60FPS on max,  The popularity of the game is allowing social media influencers to trash it for clicks and getting all the lemmings who haven't played it to buy in.  These claims are so false that I feel like I must have a unicorn PC because stability wise it's insanely smooth and any bugs I've seen are crazy minor that I wouldn't notice in any other game, like one of a million NPCs you can interact with not looking at you.  Ok you can't run this game at max settings on an old computer but what's the alternative...did you want them to cap out the settings at medium so that people who have newer hardware can't utilize it?  Do people honestly expect a $200 7 year old PS4 to work as well as a 3090?  CDPR made something truly next gen which can utilize the newest hardware, and if you don't have that hardware you can still play the game at settings suitable for your hardware and have it look the same as any other game for your hardware.  I fail to see the lack of common sense. Easily the game of the decade!… Expand "

The game's one of the most hyped-personally- aspect was character customisation and I was disappointed big time. The whole thing is bare-bones and gimmicky. You don't get any actual sliders to change the sizes or positions of your organs like eyes, ears or whatever, you just have to choose from a limited number of options. That alone wouldn't be a big problem if there were actually a meaningful number of options. The biggest gimmick was the genital part. You only get 3 options, a vagina, an uncircumcised penis and a circumcised penis. Breast and penis sizes are again limited choices. The way the genitals were added feels out of place or unnecessary. They could have had the genitals yet make it interesting to actually edit them if they added any actual character creation. As for other creation tools? Where the highest number of options you get is for the hairstyles, you don't get anything else in a satisfying number. This is Cyberpunk future and humanity has forgotten how to make good looking tattoos.  Prologue in Witcher 3 had a meaning. It was linear too but it taught you the game, it introduced you to the characters, helped you make bonds with them and actually give a damn about the story or the characters. It showed us a glimpse of the ageing Witcherman's past and helped us understand his relationship with Ciri. Gave us a reason to care about Ciri and other characters. Prologue in Cyberpunk on the other hand? It is just to get extra game hours by making a boring linear segment. The characters know you but your only experience with such things is a cutscene and that's it. You are supposed to care about them for 'reasons'. It's impossible to actually remain invested in what's going on for more than five seconds before they shove a new character you don't have a past with but apparently already know down your throat and you cannot refuse to do what they want you to do. Spent around five hours so far, can't wait to see the actual open world and be done with this part. If I am already done with the prologue and this is the open-world...well, then it is just pathetic.… Expand "

La interacción con la ciudad es nula, por poner un ejemplo, veo la fachada de lo que podía ser un edificio importante (un hospital) y la puerta está cerrada para siempre, así en todos los edificios de la ciudad, exceptuando tu casa y los lugares de historia principal.  Sólo las misiones principales son de calidad y aún así con muchos altibajos, ya que en muchas ocasiones sólo te mandaran de punto A a B para tener conversaciones insulsas en las que no te enteras de nada. En cuanto al gameplay de nuevo luces y sombras, el gunplay es correcto, pero el sigilo directamente no funciona, los enemigos a veces te ven aún estando cubierto, otras les dan espasmos y se giran de un lado a otro erráticamente, cámaras que deberían estar desactivadas (ya que las has desactivado hackeando el ordenador que las controla)  y finalizando, el hackeo es siempre la misma rutina y a la tercera vez que lo hagas ya te has aburrido de él.

Ni llega a tener los mejores gráficos de la generación, ni destaca como juego de tiroteos, ni en la mejor narrativa, ni como rpg donde hasta Fallout 4, me parece mejor, ni como mundo inmersivo, donde RDR2 o su propio TW3 que les da mil patadas este título.  ¿Este es el juego que tenía que marcar época y ser la piedra angular de los títulos futuros y del rpg en general? Espero que no, porque entonces estamos jodidos.… Expand "

I’ve tried to be as objective as possible, and I’ve done almost all there is to do in Night City. The TL:DR is that I’m disappointed with Cyberpunk, but it’s still far superior to most of the shlock out there. That said, CDPR seems to be turning toward the “monetized EA shlockfest” model that killed Bioware. Crying shame.  I’m playing on a high end rig that can barely handle high settings at a passible frame rate. This is a poorly optimized, buggy game, which should be no surprise to anyone given the launch coverage. Don’t bother with it unless you are running high specs. However, I didn’t run into any game breaking bugs—just some wonky graphics and a couple quests that I needed to find work-arounds for. (That and I can’t unequip items because anything bound to the middle mouse is useless. Annoying, but could be worse.)  Speaking of quests, I was super concerned when the devs announced that the main story would be “slightly shorter than Witcher 3 so that people would actually finish it.” That sounded like a euphemism for “streamlining for the mainstream.” My concern was well-founded. The main story isn’t slightly shorter…it’s maybe a third as long and a tenth as inspired. The side quests are plentiful—the world is littered with them. But unlike Witcher 3, the quests are not character or story driven—they are cookie-cutter smash and grabs.  Character is what elevated Witcher 3 to greatness. Complicated, multifaceted, engaging characters, set in a brilliant world, matched with exceptional writing. But in contrast to Geralt of Rivia, Cyberpunk gives us…V. Just V, who is about as inspiring as her name. V’s friends are slightly more interesting, but not by much. The supporting cast are at best archetypes—at worst, try-hard caricatures. The voice acting is generally good, if a bit workman and not overly inspired. I found myself skipping most of the optional dialogue, which I never did in Witcher 3.  Ah, Keanu Reeves. I like him. I’d have a drink with him. But I’m fairly certain that not even Keanu thinks of himself as a talented actor—and he’s definitely no voice actor. His take on Johnny Silverhand is one-note, dry, lifeless and monotone. It doesn’t help that the character is incredibly unlikeable.  The game’s general aesthetic is summed up by the lyrics to one of its feature songs: “We are not the sheep, we were made to rule--we like to watch, we like to taste, we like to **** and we like pain.” If this sounds like a revelation, then go get yourself a high-end PC and enjoy the ride. But if you’re like me, it sounds a bit catchy, but mostly…puerile.  What I’ve been hinting at, the biggest problem with the game, is difficult to put into words. It’s a spiritual problem. Despite the vast world and thousands of hours that went into the game’s development—the thing is just lacking a soul. Unlike Deus Ex or Shadowrun—games that ask tough questions and ooze with subtle design and intelligence—Cyberpunk can’t get beyond the generic. The writer’s don’t get past “Corps are bad,” and don’t even bother following up with a why or a because. Without the incredible source material of the Witcher, the writers fall back on mundane platitudes and trite melodrama.  All that said, the hack and slash is fun. For all of its many failings, I kept playing in a dopamine-induced coma for over 100 hours. I will likely even play another run. There are some moments of brilliance (like the talking gun and the eerie-as-all-hell crucifixion.) It’s clear that blood, sweat and tears went into making this world huge, packed and pretty—but it’s empty, all the same.  *EDIT after 159 hours of play and all achievements* Downgrading to a 6 because:  1)	The endings are dismal and essentially identical in terms of the consequences to your character. Full completion and your choices during the game make little difference. (You don’t really make any meaningful choices during the game, so that isn’t a surprise.) The endings are primarily distinguished by their degree of dismalness—ranging from mind-numbingly empty and depressing to depressing with a hint of bitter-sweet. (Think Knights of the Old Republic 2—but not quite that bad, since no one actually cares about V.)  2)	Hacking and crafting are both incredibly dull. Hacking consist of targeting, scrolling through a drop down menu (which frequently closes before you can input a hack,) and depending on your skill level, either watching everything die or watching someone get tickled. Hacking is the “caster” class in Cyberpunk…imagine a wizard throwing invisible fireballs that just cause people to fall down, and you’ll have a decent sense of Cyberpunk hacking.  The main quest is half-finished.  I'm clearly insane for playing so long. I'd rant more, but Metacritic is cutting me off.… Expand "

It is bad because it does not bind to secondary missions, the main storyline, shouts ""Leave these secondary tasks, here (in the main storyline) events develop more interestingly."" But this is due to the fact that you are very much attracted to the main character, worry and feel what he is feeling. Throughout the game, I experienced a shiver of what was happening in the game, which contributed to the very good soundtrack. Where it is necessary, it inflates, where it is necessary it will relax, but the game, like life, will not wait and will demand the decisions that you make.

The story is ok, nothing epic about it, most of the endings are not satisfying at all and are depressing. The holes in the story and game world are legion. There is no proper true after campaign playing. The world looks great but is empty a lot of the time or has terrible AI space filler bots. The long distance away moving cars are embarrassing, I mean did they play any GTA's since 4 at all? Where are any flying possibility for these cyborgs of the future? Why drive ground cars that look like fancified cars of the past? You can turn off a lot of offensive material but not the vulgar offensive language, the marxist social agenda in this is obvious and revolting. CPDR is staffed with occultist scum writers etc. Keaneu Reeves can take a hike, totally dirt bag and the off putting hollywhoring adds nothing to the game.

This game is absolutely amazing, runs just fine on my Legion 7 with a RTX3070 and after about 20 hours I have not came across one bug or glitch or anything.  I have never seen a game with so much attention to detail in the world, more so than GTA V and thats saying something.  The amount of cool tech, weapons, upgrades, and other RPG elements is awesome.  I generally fast forward or skip cut scenes and could care less about the story but this one has me watching every minute.  Its just a big fun beautiful open world to explore, tons of content and stuff to do in the game.  I feel like I have barley scratched the surface at 20 hours and the game still has that new feel to it as I still keep finding new fun stuff to do.  Thank you to the team that made this game, I know it was a rough start but as of this writing the game is a 10/10, assuming you like open world/RPG games and/or cyberpunk themes.… Expand "
mr_jhnzn,"Jan  5, 2021",9," So there seems to be a lot of confusion around what this game is. I was almost completely ignorant of the discussion and marketing surrounding this game so I came to Night City almost completely without expectations. All I knew I had been a fan of William Gibson since the 90's and I just wanted the experience, all of the genre tropes, all of it. And yes, this game delivers exactly that.So there seems to be a lot of confusion around what this game is.

All I knew I had been a fan of William Gibson since the 90's and I just wanted the experience, all of the genre tropes, all of it. And yes, this game delivers exactly that. And it is gorgeous. I game on a fairly modest 2-year old PC with a RTX2070 and I have maxed out everything but ray tracing, as to me the global illumination fits better to my vision of the genre. I have not seen a single performance issue, but have had couple weird resolution bugs which were cleared by simply reloading.I also want to underline how gorgeously the main characters are motion captured. Their animations convey feeling, nervousness, boredom. At moments you can forget that it's not a cutscene, but being rendered before your eyes and you can move around. To me this game sets the bar on how a game should create an atmosphere.To me this is also the sweet spot in the open-world RPG-land. It's somewhere between Metro: Exodus and Fallout - you can decide on a lot, especially on how to excatly solve the problems thrown at you, but if you're not interested in the RPG-ish elements, you can mostly ignore them. My RPG-loving friends have described their experiences as lackluster, but again, this is closer to Metro than Fallout which to me is perfect. Shooter-mechanics wise, CP2077 is at least at the Mass Effect-level of fun and ease of control, but with more satisfying weaponry. The looting mechanics seem a bit rushed, but I expect the developer to almost completely overhaul the balance in future updates. The biggest disappontment has been The AI. Theres practically no sense of 'danger' if you can stumble on an enemy way beyond your characters' level and just back off beyond it's pre-set routes and pick it off from the distance. It won't follow you or try to hide, it'll just stand there. It'll most likely take a major update to address, but it hasn't kept me from enjoying the story.TL:DR - if you're worried about your PC performance and/or bugs, I'd encourage you to try - I had no problems beside few minor visual glitches. But check your expectations before buying. It's a beautiful city filled with stories and interesting characters first, a mediocre shooter second and a RPG third - if this is not what you're looking for, you might want to hold off from buying for now.… Expand "

I enjoyed it because its quite fun to play, its fun to drive around the city on my bike or car or whatever, listening to the fire songs on the radio. In that...its pretty fun, and you can easily sink your teeth into it.  Now, here's where things go downhill...I know I rated an 8, but I feel like pointing out Cyberpunk's faults and flaws, cause man believe me it has PLENTY.  First, bugs, of course, but tbh, these are fixable. Even Witcher 3 was poorly optimized and was ridden with bugs at launch, so this is not a huge issue for me, a buggy launch. So lets go on now...  Lack of, barber shops...man this was a bummer. I absolutely loved seeing my Geralt with different hairstyles and beards that I like, and that factor was missing from Cyberpunk. Not even tattoos, although I can excuse tattoos, but barber shops SHOULD'VE been there.  Choices...yes there are choices, but it is all an illusion. I remember, that in E3 or something CDPR had said that if we do not put the body down in the Sandra Dorsett mission NCPD will react, and how do they react? They just push you backwards and force you to drop the body anyways. I was expecting they'd shoot you or arrest you or something, but no.  AI...AI is one of the places where Cyberpunk fails. There's no Police AI, they just pop up everywhere you are. NPC AI is also not great enough, no person reacts to you, well majorly.  As someone with quite a bit of knowledge of the Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk universe, every Night City resident, rich or poor, should carry a weapon to protect themselves against the brutal nightmares of Night City. But nope, only gangs and police have weapons. Cars don't drive around you either.  Driving is not good enough, its not smooth and your car has the high tendency to flip over on its head.  Maybe some positives, as well: The character of V is quite well-written. Not as much as our favorite Witcher, but good enough to get a pass.  Story is where the game outshines every other game. Story is the best I have ever seen in a videogame, fully-tense and amazing.  Overall, you might think why i didn't give a negative score...the reason: I still support CDPR. I believe that they are at a point of their existence where they can learn from their mistakes and forever be the 'good guy', or be overcome by greed for money and lack of dedication and be clubbed under the same category as EA, Bioware, etc. Also the fact that this is their first step into Cyberpunk universe, and i remember how Witcher 1 and 2 also were similarly ruined by ambition, then came Witcher 3. So there's still hope.  I won't say its a must-buy, but its a good game definitely. If you can manage to bear through it, it'll give you fun. Maybe you won't LOVE it, but you'll like it. Won't...outright recommend you, but if you're like, bored and looking for a small new game to play, get Cyberpunk and play it.… Expand "

Goods: - Great gun play, albeit gun selection isn't as large as I was hoping for, but all the basics are covered with a few options. - The game does offer a lot of approaches to mission completion, stealth is almost always an option. - Absolutely amazing characters, first time I wanted to sit through the final credits just to listen to them some more. - The in-world tasks are easy enough to complete them quickly, and offer a lot of incentive to complete them through unique item finds. - Overall, first game I completed 100%, all side missions and all.  Bads: - A few bugs, which are rather funny, and semi-regular crashes on new computer which is rather frustrating. - Not a big one, but some models look like previous generation or almost Crysis-era. Just compare someone like Judy or Claire models with Johnny Silverhand who doesn't have any shadows on his face (with Ultra Graphics settings). - Last few River missions are incredibly lazily done.

Saying the game is beautiful is a massive understatement. The level of immersion was such that I have already played through the game twice, completing all side-quests, gigs, NCPD events, etc, and I still have to fight the temptation of going back. That is over 120 hrs each playthrough.  There are still the occasional bugs but their impact is minor at best. Most of them come from mods I'm using and not the actual game.  The level of effort put into this game is massive. The level of detail in night city is unbelievable. Even the smallest side-quest has good to excellent writing and design. The game's main storyline is powerful, it tells a great story. If you play it through in one go the game will not last you more than 30 hours.

I had played the game at release and had I been scoring the game then, my review would probably be quite different. First I will talk about my experience at launch on PC. Cyberpunk 2077 released on PC with a host of bugs ranging from graphical glitches to audio bugs. There were also issues with certain quests failing to trigger as well as wonky physics, or a game corrupting issue if you crafted too many items. I didn’t encounter too many of these but they were there. I wouldn’t say my launch issues were any worse than say Skyrim at release way back in 2011. That being said? Players on last gen consoles had it way worse and CDPR even withheld review copies from press so many players weren’t aware of the issues until the game was in hand. They clearly knew the game wasn’t ready and shipped it anyway. That alone would have been enough reason for me to knock the score down. After squandering the goodwill they had garnered with the Witcher 3, they would have to play catch up and work to fix issues. Patches came and went as did a roadmap with target dates which slipped by.  So how is the game now in 2022 after it’s disastrous launch. Well it’s still not without it’s issues, but it still is a great game. Even playing it on PC with those issues mentioned above I could tell that there was a good game in there. It’s just a shame that the conversation became about the games’ shortcomings rather than its triumphs and the blame rests squarely on CDPR management.  Cyberpunk is first and foremost an RPG with shooter mechanics. You have various skill trees with points to allocate. Do you want to make more of an assault type character or maybe you want to focus on a melee build with mantis blades with investment in stealth perks? Maybe you want to be a net runner and specialize in quick hacks? My preferred play style was using smart optics and smart guns which turned sniper rifles into a bit of an aimbot capable of nailing enemies behind cover.  Where Cyberpunk really excels though is world building and it’s character development. This city truly feels like a seedy city with factions vying for control. It’s writing is sharp and many of the quest lines stick with you. Think of the Bloody Baron quest line from Witcher 3. Cyberpunk is chock full of detailed and interesting characters. Keanu Reeves of course plays Johnny Silverhand and I love the way they used him and his voice here.  The score and music are on point as well and the song Never Fade Away takes on a whole new meaning by the time you reach the end credits. I won’t reveal more here due to spoilers.  Cyberpunk 2077 is a much improved game over the way it originally released. It was recently on sale for $10 during Black Friday. It was on sale again for a paltry $5 in Apr 2022 at Best Buy. I can’t speak to the PS4/Xbox One versions. I have heard they have improved, but if at all possible wait to play it on PS5/Series X or pick it up on PC.   It’s been a long road and there is likely future content to come next year. If you have waited, your wait will have paid off. Or you may wait for the new content in 2022. They might even bundle said new content into a ""definitive"" or ""complete"" edition like Witcher 3 ""complete edition"".… Expand "

Dech-beroucí město Night City je kyberpunkem poseto do nejmenšího detailu, také ale překvapivě plné chyb a stupidních mechanismů které nejdou jen tak odpustit.  Z úst vývojářů nám bylo přímo řečeno předem co nás čeká, například dosud největší herní město, neskutečně propracovaný RPG systém nebo naprosto revoluční wanted model. Většiny věcí jsme se ale nedočkali.  Cyberpunk2077 je za mě smutná střílečka, u které na první pohled jde vidět na co se zde vývojáři zaměřili nejvíce. Design této hry je neskutečný, město , lidé i ostatní modely jsou nádherný. Story je bez debat umělecká práce a spolu s Johnnym Silverhandem můžete zažít spoustu zábavy. Škoda že zde není ani jedna slibovaná hraná cutscena. Město je krásné ale tupé a NPC mají přímo nulovou AI. Policie nefunguje. Důležitá volba ihned na začátku hry a to úprava penisu nemá žádný vliv na hru, stejně jako vaše rozhodování v dialogu. Další úprava postavy, vozidel nebo bejváku ve hře nejsou. Fyzika je unikát a přinejmenším na konzolích vám díky ní spadne hra šestkrát za večer. Voda, která skoro obklopuje celé Nightcity nezná pojem fyzika a jeto spíše oblak který má texturu vody.

The world building, the character development, the weight of your decisions: absolutely insane.  Some bugs, mostly visual, very few required a reload at checkpoint to fix. Maybe I got lucky. If you really want, you can wait a while for them to iron out the game - OR - you can play a playthrough now and just enjoy a sick ass story, and then play a second one when the game is largely patched and maybe even has DLC out.  I did most sidequests and finished the main story in 50 hours, I saved some sidequests for another playthrough and didn't do much of the gigs/contracts so I could've probably prolonged the game.  The last gen console version was a disaster but they said they will get it to a better state, though not on par with PC or current gen consoles. If you want to experience this game, PC at the moment is probably the best for immersion and the true cyberpunk experience, assuming you have a computer can handle it. But be ready for slight bugs every now and then. If you don't want that then just wait a bit.  it's not going to be a crazy second life game as some people expected it to be, and if you really nitpick and focus on certain things it may seem 'artificial', but the world is really good at making itself feel alive as you progress through the story/sidequests. It was after all advertised as a narrative-driven open world game, and that it is. If you go around trying to conversate with every AI just walking around you'll realize its still just a game and only under certain circumstances will those AI do something special. But again, that's not the focus of the game nor the job of the crowds. Besides the console versions, most complaints I've heard are about some missing features, current disliked features, bugs, and cosmetic choices. All of these I believe are easily patchable and fixable so if those put you off, just wait a bit. But if you want to participate in a sick ass journey, go ahead :)  The game overall, even in it's current state, is fantastic. I can only imagine how much better it'll be when they add more features, polish things up, and add dlc as well. They have a lot to work with.… Expand "

Thankfully I wasn't part of the over-hype train. After that trailer I decided to not look a thing and shield myself from the game until the release and I'm so glad I did. My only expectations were a deus-ex / open world / story driver game with the cyberpunk, over the top néons look. I got just that, and much more. In a way, it's completely different than what I expected as well as exactly what I wanted it to be and more.  What do i mean ? Usually with these stories it's all about the world that needs saving for the corporations and capitalism. Here ? It's all about saving yourself. I've always found stories at a smaller scale more relatable and more enjoyable, the accent being on the characters you meet along the way.  That's what you can expect here. The companions are some of the best character written in a game IMO.  That's where the game shines, its quests and characters. The gameplay itself is serviceable to good, don't expect an sandbox open-world à-la GTA or Elder scrolls, that's not what the game wants to be. The open world is here to serve the story, not the other way around.  The bugs, ahhh the bugs. As of this day, ( mid-Mars ) after about 130 hours of gameplay I've encountered plenty of very minor bug that take you out of the game for a few second of laughter, but nothing game-breaking.  Overhaul, Cyberpunk gained a place in my top X games along side The witcher, Mass effect and Souls franchises.  One thing remains to be said. CDPR does deserve the hate coming their way, they simply lied and the state of the game on ps4/Xone is unacceptable, my trust in them is gone for now and I'm very sad about it since they were my favorite studio.… Expand "

Возможно в момент выхода игры, было много багов, но сейчас за исключением визуальных (Да действуют на нервы и мешают погружению, но не мешают играть и получать удовольствие) все отлично. Компьютер самый средний, и тянет эту игру на средних с приемлимыми 60 кадрами. Сайд квесты даже инетерснее основной сюжетной кампании. Класических квестов по типу - принеси, зачисть локацию и т.д. практически нет. Все главные и второстепенные прописанны так хорошо, что тебе хочется изучать этот мир, тебе хочется узнать чем закончилась та, или иная история. Часто слышал от разных блогеров об отсутсвии выбора и вариативности, что по моему большая глупость. Да, пиар-менеджеры рассказывали о небывалой вариативности, и они откровенно лукавили - да, вариативность в игре есть, но далеко не во всем. Но это и не мешает игре, той вариативности в геймплее в игре такого уровня пока невозможно добится в силу невозможности реализации подобного подхода в настолько серьезной игре. Это же не инди песочница, которая ведет свое повествование в тексте. А вариативность на уровне, а может даже и выше чем в Ведьмаке, что на порядок лучше чем в любой ААА игре выходившей за последние годы. Боюсь даже Dying light 2 не сможет переплюнуть CyberPunk в вариативности. Графика в игре потрясающая, поведение героев, мимика, а так же поведение героев в диалогах (Практически никто не сидит на месте, а чем то занимается: наливает алкоголь, употребляет наркотик, садится и т.д.)  поражает своим качеством. Ты как будто находишься в реальном мире, где НПС ощущаются больше живыми людьми, чем тупыми болванчиками. Кстати насчет тупых болванчиков. Враги не отличаются сильным ИИ, но все же он будет получше чем в большинстве современных шутеров, где электронные идиоты просто бегут на тебя, в Киберпанке они пользуются укрытиями и даже жрут аптечки.

Но тем не менее это отличная игра. Музыка, атмосфера, сеттинг, персонажи, окружение - все это просто прекрасно в своем исполнении и изобилует вниманием к деталям и проработке. Игра поднимает целую кучу проблем киберпанка (трансгуманизм, что делает человека человеком, наличие души, самосознание, поглощение технологиями личности, навязывание устройства мира корпорациями  и т.п.) и втирает тебе это настолько сильно, что запросто ловишь общий вайб игры и погружаешься в них. Эти же идеи поднимались в каком нибудь ""Призрак в доспехах"", но сделано там это куда более скомкано (явно в силу общей продолжительности картины, но все же). Геймплейно - это чистой воды деус экс, но сделанный на более низком уровне. В двух словах - стиль прохождения не настолько сильно зависит от прокачки, локации не настолько проработаны. Стрельба сделана средне, управление авто - плохо. Есть сильный перегруз по игромеханикам, которые на тебя сваливают в кучу в начале игры, и большинство из которых не работают в полную силу (либо вообще не работают). Так же по факту прохождения было ощущение, что в сюжете не хватает жирного куска сюжета, да и к общей продолжительности есть вопросы (40 часов на полное прохождение со всеми побочками, за исключением однообразных (знаков вопроса) заказов). Не понимаю претензии людей, которые говорят, что концовка в игре зависит только от выбора диалога в конце. Для получения этих диалогов нужно предварительно выполнить линейки побочных квестов, которые уже и позволяют выбрать, что, как я считаю, вполне приемлемо. ПС: пара слов про баги - играл на версии 1.52, спустя полтора года с выхода проекта, их все еще достаточно много, пару раз перезагружался, чтобы перепройти игру из-за несработавшего скрипта.

But this game doesn't help with immersion outside of the main story line. You should really use your imagination, in many places. Say you want to have a drink at a bar. You will not be given it in a glass, a shop window will pop up and you'll buy a bottle. No drinking animation, no eating animation, no sitting animation (you can't even sit on a bench). If you want to immerse, the game doesn't help with that outside of story quests. And it's a shame, because it's a big city that we could've explored like Novigrad. But oh well.  Still a fun game to play, just keep in mind that its open world is not going to help you with immersion.  And the main story is worth checking out :)… Expand "

The graphics, side quests, characters and music pull you into a city, that feels alive and fun. It is not often I play story driven games twice, but this time I did. It gets a high thumbs up. Up front, I played this game 1 year after its release for the first time. It was almost bug-free. I'd go so far as to say, this game has the least bugs I encountered in an open-world game. So please, for the love of God, stop cracking jokes about how this game isn't finished yet. It's honestly really annoying. The game isn't perfect. There were little things in there I found annoying and/or frustrating. First off, a minor complaint about the clothing in this game. I always took issue with how you aren't really able to combine the clothes you want. I wanna look fashionable god dammit! The way the game handles clothing is either through vendors or crafting, clothing has stats and different rarities, which sometimes forces you to choose function over style, as some clothing items are simply not available in legendary or epic forms. But like I said, a minor complaint. A larger issue I have are the different endings. I don't think that any one of the 5 satisfied me. Sure they all make sense because in the world of cyberpunk, there are no happy 100% happy endings, but I really was expecting more at this point. But for me, this game is just otherwise great.… Expand "

C'est clairement le plus beau jeu que j'ai vu, le RT est bien exploité, c'est propre, beaucoup de réglages possible et un framerate carrément honnête en prime : côté technique, c'est un 10/10 bien mérité (et pourtant je ne suis pas tendre sur ce domaine). Certains diront ""ouais mais les graphismes ça fait pas tout blablabla"". Certes oui, mais sur un jeu comme Cyberpunk, c'est clairement un argument de vente (et personnellement, le visuel est mon premier sens stimulé, largement plus que le reste).  Cette partie étant traitée, passons au reste. Bien sûr, j'imagine que vous n'êtes pas des crédules de la dernière pluie, et que quand vous voyez des trailers suivis de promesses telles que ""Dans Cyberpunk on pourra tout faire, aller partout, parler à tout le monde"" vous savez que c'est du blabla marketing. Alors je vais vous le traduire sans langue de bois : Dans Cyberpunk, vous pouvez tout faire, enfin tout ce qui a été prévu hein. Vous pouvez parler à tout le monde ! c'est vrai... sauf que tous les persos en dehors de l'histoire+annexe vous diront qu'ils ""n'ont pas le temps"", ou vous enverrons vous faire balader.  Vous pouvez aller partout, mais surtout là où ça a été prévu hein... ce qui se traduit par ""porte verrouillée"" dans 90% des cas.  Je ne me souviens plus si le marketing avait annoncé des trucs révolutionnaires concernant l'I.A, mais si c'est le cas on peut tout de suite oublier : les super gardes d'élite ultra entrainés sont en alerte, qu'est ce qu'ils font ? Ils font deux groupes de un, qui ira se planter fixement face à un mur pour voir si la menace ne sortirait pas par l'interstice du carrelage, et nous offre son dos pour une saisie en mode furtif.  En gros, rien de bien nouveau : la recette est un pot-pourri de tout ce qu'on trouve dans les jeux actuels : un monde ouvert aux bâtiments fermés, des pnj qui remplissent le décor mais c'est tout, sans oublier la fameuse composante rpg (qui semble un pré-requis obligatoire) avec beaucoup trop d'objets inutiles, une quantité absurde d'armes et éléments d'armures qui vous feront changer de stuff littéralement toutes les 5mn, et les aberrations qui vont avec, telles que ""ha, ce short a plus d'armures que le pantalon cargo de spécialiste"". Les armes ont des statistiques, ce qui crée des situations comme ""avec cette mitraillette, je dois lui mettre un chargeur entier dans la tête, alors qu'avec l'autre qui a de meilleures stats je le tue en trois balles"" (ha, si un dev' lit ça, par pitié faut arrêter ça... ça brise tout le réalisme et ça frustre énormément le joueur)  Si vous avez joué à des quelconques AAA ou AAAA ces dernières années, vous ne serez pas perdu.

Its definitely important to complete the gigs and side quests before pushing the main story, even if it seems to conflict with the idea of limited time, because Johnny chippin' in with thoughts on all the crazy jobs you find yourself doing plays a part in their character development.

Вырезанный контент торчит то тут, то там и это бросается в глаза.  Сюжет: Это один из главных плюсов игры. Если проходить игру исключительно по основной сюжетной ветке не отвлекаясь на якобы живой, открытый мир и сайд квесты за исключением некоторых, то вы получите крайне положительные эмоции. Я будто буквально прожил все эти моменты вместе с Ви и Джонни. Игра в которой приглашенную звезду использовали действительно хорошо и правильно. CD projekt с каждым своим проектом всё лучшее и лучшее продвигаются в сюжетном плане.  Геймплей: Если мы исключаем основную сюжетную линию, то вам придется развлекать себя самому, но проблема в том, что открытый мир не то что бы скучный он просто обычный. Первые 15-20 часов импланты, скрипты вполне развлекают, но рано или поздно приходит осознание, что в игре действительно интересных и нужных скриптов всего 2-3, а твои мечты о том чтоб обвесить себя полностью имплантами разбиваются об количестве таковых. Город и окрестности служат декорацией, но безумно красивой.  Музыка: Это лучшая музыка, что я когда либо слышал в играх и дело не в музыкальных предпочтениях, а в том как она подходит под атмосферу и при том сама же её создает.  Персонажи: Тяжело остаться равнодушным к таким настоящим, живым персонажам это ещё один главный плюс игры. Очень интересно наблюдать за взаимоотношениями нашего героя с людьми, что нам повстречаются в ходе нашего приключения и это относиться не только к основным персонажам, но и второстепенным и трудно не сопереживать каждому из них.  Атмосфера: Обычно сеттинг киберпанка у нас ассоциируется с чем-то холодным, одиноким, депрессивным и да это тут есть, но также Найт Сити может быть ярким и веселым особенно благодаря персонажам. Огромная палитра эмоций во время и после прохождения игры.  Графика: Я бы мог часами разглядывать каждую деталь в этой игре. Лучшая ли это графика за последние годы? определенно, но до некстгена пока ещё никто не дошел в том числе и ""Cyberpunk 2077"". Часто просто забивал на задания и просто гулял по Найт Сити и любовался видами я ни в одной игре так часто не пользовался фоторежимом.  Транспорт: Много критики было к управлению/физике транспорта и тут я выберу нейтральную сторону т.к управление/физика транспорта в любых не гоночных играх всегда посредственное, а вот в плане дизайна транспорта всё отлично и придраться не к чему, но то что нет возможности кастомизации удручает.  Впервые за долгое время я испытал действительно настоящие эмоции от игры. Я просыпался и засыпал с мыслями о Cyberpunk 2077. CD Projekt напомнили мне, что игры это искусство и даже больше чем кино.

(note, many things will be listed under good AND bad for different reasons)... GOOD: -Main story/side quest NPC's are well written. I found myself wanting to do more quests with Panam, Judy, River, etc. I wanted to get to know them much more. -Night City is stunning and filled with potential, but on the surface only. Likewise with the badlands.  Bad: -Main story. Not the actual writing, but length. I was floored when I hit the ""point of no return"" quest. It felt as if I was only 50% done the main story. While I'm happy it's not AS long as the Witcher 3 or many open world games, this was far, far too short. -Night City...Like I said, stunning world was crafted by CDPR, but only on the surface. After an hour or two or walking/running to missions you realize that's all this world actuall has to offer. Mission after mission, not fun side quests. No doors to buildings to open and explore (open-locked).  It's a beautiful but hollow, empty city. -Police. Forget about killing random NPC's, police will just randomly turn on you. Helped them a few times for them to only attack and spawn more while I was looting the scene. I also jumped off a second floor balcony in front of police and they attacked. Worst police AI in gaming. -NPCs. When set to high they really add a lot of visual noise to Night City. But that's just it. Visual noise. They actually add nothing. They are far too alike, will often disappear if you look the other way, will run away or crouch in fear for no reason at all. Like the police, worst NPC ai in gaming. -Cut content/feeling unfinished. This game FEELS rushed. Every time I immerse myself in the world, around the corner is something that makes the game feel unfinished. -Life paths. This was my single and truly only major disappointment. The ONLY night city stream I watched was the life path one. It was made out to be a fairly significant thing that would provide you with a solid and good reason to re-play the game at least 3 times. In reality? The only major differences are the first 20-30 minutes. After that the only major thing comes in dialogue choices which for my nomad, never made a difference one bit.  Bugs/Crashes: -For myself, I had no crashes at all. Bugs for me also amounted to t-poses, weapon display info staying on screen, items not lootable on the ground. Don't recall having any game breaking bugs. Having said that, everyone's experience with bugs will vary. Looking on youtube shows that bugs can be a serious issue in this game for many.  Overall: Compared to when I played this game at launch, I did have fun with it. And there is fun that can be had with this game, but it does require overlooking many things. For myself, it reminds me of Fallout 4. A very mediocre game that doesn't excel in anything but one that I can still sink many hours into.  I gave the game a 5 simply because there were moments that it felt like a solid 8, but other times a 2. In it's current state it's a very middle of the road game, at best.  Should you buy it now? I'd say if you feel the itch to buy it, check out third party websites for sales, or simply wait for GoG/Steam to offer a 50%+ sale. Otherwise I'd hold off still.… Expand "

Dwoodlander,"Feb 24, 2022",6," Contrary to CDPR trying to say the game's only problems are with base consoles, I would argue that this game's biggest problems go well beyond bugs, crashes, and performance.

In almost every respect, this game is a half-baked, unpolished mess with only some hints at what could have been a great game. It redeems itself somewhat by certain elements, but it's hard not to feel ripped off, even on PC. My experience with Cyberpunk has been a wake-up call to 1) never pre-order games ever again, 2) never purchase a CDPR game again, unless several years have passed, it has been thoroughly-vetted, and is at a bargain bin price, and 3) be extremely skeptical of online review sites: unbelievable that so many reviewers immediately  jumped to give this mess 9s and 10s.  With bugs around every corner, clearly unfinished or cut content, mediocre shooter mechanics, a lifeless open world, and so on, it is hard to even know how to begin reviewing this game.  I think what best encapsulates the problems with Cyberpunk is the example of witnessing an NPC playing guitar on the streets for the first time. It was incredible to see the level of detail: they are playing a song that corresponds to their individual finger movements and correct guitar chords. However, five minutes later you could accidentally run over an NPC due to the horrible driving mechanics, triggering a ""police chase,"" which consists of police drones just appearing out of thin air; drive down a corner and suddenly you are no longer wanted. That's it. You also see how cars aren't even programmed to move around you or notice that if you look at cars in the distance they appear as weird JPEG cut-outs. The list goes on and on with some of the most primitive elements of game design either not functioning or wholly absent. It is as if the developers spent time on ""nExT-gEN"" features like NPCs playing accurate guitar chords but somehow left out so many simple features. This extends to lifeless NPCs, a horrible user interface, boring and shallow ""RPG"" mechanics, short main story, pointless origin choices, and so on.  The game does have some strengths buried in there, and I would say that is with the core main storyline, character design, voice-acting, soundtrack, and potentially graphics. I say potentially because the game looks great only on high-end hardware. Any mid-range PC even seems to end up looking blurry and grainy. The scripted cutscenes and certain interiors look fantastic though and the visual atmosphere is overall really good.  The core storyline with Johnny Silverhand was pretty good and kept me emotionally invested; however, it is nothing revolutionary. It relies on pretty much every previously made cyberpunk trope. I love the genre, so this wasn't necessarily a bad thing, just not very original. The voice-acting and characters were overall excellent, especially female V, Johnny Silverhand (Keanu), and Jackie Welles. I also really liked the soundtrack with a few stand-out tracks that I continue to listen to even after finishing the game. These elements were enough to keep me playing through to the end, but definitely don't save the game from ultimately being an overhyped, mediocre mess for the most part.… Expand "

wokenoodle,"Feb 26, 2022",6," It’s hard to talk about Cyberpunk out of context. It was what felt like the most hyped game ever at the time of release and one of the hardest disappointments and PR disasters in the industry shortly after. But even if the bold and dishonest advertisements are ignored, the game doesn’t even leave up to the expectations it sets itself.  Right from the start, the character creation menuIt’s hard to talk about Cyberpunk out of context. It was what felt like the most hyped game ever at the time of release and one of the hardest disappointments and PR disasters in the industry shortly after. But even if the bold and dishonest advertisements are ignored, the game doesn’t even leave up to the expectations it sets itself.  Right from the start, the character creation menu greets you confidently by presenting a lot of choices in your appearance and a choice of the background. Really enticing! But the former choices turn out to be quite slim, while the latter one doesn’t really contribute much throughout your playthrough. And the letdowns don’t end there. Everything, from the quality of quests to the progression systems, from the driving to how rich the city environment you drive through is, ultimately fails to deliver on the first impression it makes. Everything you engage with sooner or later turns out to be much shallower than expected, undercooked, or just broken.  For me, the biggest disappointment was the equipment. In itself, it’s a system that inspires you to get into a certain look, follow a cool style direction, cherish your newfound awesome guns - up to the point when you realize it’s a looter shooter, so guns last for about an hour, while armor stat of your clothes makes no sense and if you play to win, you’ll soon look like a clown-hobo hybrid, flexing a Versace blazer on top of your grandmother’s boxers. And things don’t get better when the equipment comes in contact with other systems: I was the most excited in the game by quite a margin when I finally managed to buy the double-jump implant, but it turns out that there’s not much to do on the rooftops: they’re usually quite ugly and the game doesn’t consider them to be an important part of your exploration. A letdown again.  And it’s like with the double-jump thing throughout the whole game: Cyberpunk invites you to make your own way, but it’s really only ready to support a narrow, expected playstyle. It wants you to do its missions, to go through locations within a certain path it nudges you into. A safe path. The one where Night City looks good, its citizens feel alive and things don’t break (as much). You can’t choose your own adventure, you have to play V’s. And V’s story together with Johnny Silverhand isn’t bad at all, it’s one of the strongest parts of the game, but I feel like letting you experience it in a more linear, controlled, and directed way, as the game clearly wants you to anyway, would be a better decision than to put up a flimsy facade of an uninspired, broken and dead open world.  Music is cool, tho. And so is art direction, and some quality-of-life features. People clearly worked hard at the game and I don’t want to rob them of their due credit. They just lacked the time and, unfortunately, the vision. And even CDPR is still able to provide the former, I don’t see how they could redeem themselves for not having the latter.… Expand "

When it comes to the female voice acting, i liked it better than the male, idk why but it felt more ""real""... When it comes to the immense updates, i can say that ""It feels different, better, but still not enough"". On my first playthrough i had a couple of minor bugs, some crashes, a lot of frame drops, and a lot of those visual annoying glitches. On this second playthrough, the number of bugs went from a few to almost non existant, the only one i had 2 times, was when a blue bar showed on my monitor all the time, kinda annoying. Visual glitches were nowhere to be found, performance was better even. The immersion didn't change much, this game is a lot of things, but it's not a GTA, i don't feel like going around running over people or interacting with them, and when i do they still feel very robotic... With this second playthrough i also felt those ""shiiiiiiiiiii this was done much better in Witcher 3"" moments, where attention to detail was off the charts but in Cyberpunk was left behind a lot of times... Talking with someone like something i just did never happened, all those things that if the devs had the time, they would add some line changes and all that...  This replay, gave me a better overrall experience, soo i think the new score i fair. For me, this game kinda screwed the pooch in a lot of things that won't ever be better, only if they could turn back time, and one of them would be to make two separate games... I think we became good Mercs wayyyyyyyyyyyy to fast, holy **** we literally make 3 missions and people already talk to us like legends... In my opinion, we should've had a first game, with no Johnny, just mentions of a legendary rockerboy terrorist who died 50 years ago, and the premise of the first game would be just what they said, tto be a legendary merc, we would spend most of the game with Jackie, doing all sort of crazy stuff, and by the end we would be almost legends, leaving that legendary status for the second game.  In the second game, **** would happen like what we got now, Jackie dies (and is much more emotional because we had like 50hours of game behind us with him), and we get a chip wioth Johnny who was a legend and mentioned all the time in the first game... and now it's a race against time to survive...  For me this would be a much better premise, but hey, it's easy to throw around our two cents after something is made....  Soo yeah, overall, still a good game, a bit better even.  First review:  Score: 8.7  This game could've been soo **** much, this could've cemented CDPR as the absolute legends of RPGs.... After the success of the Witcher, everything was set for them, their reputation was spotless, they had nothing to worry about. They should've just shut the hell up, give some updates, be honest and deliver on what they promised.... They failed in all of those tasks: -They talked too much -Gave empty updates -They lied through their teeth -They didn't deliver what they promised.  And even then, EVEN THEN, this game is a Good game for, even Great! Holy **** even with all the things above, even without talking about the bugs and poor performance, this game for me is good/great!  For me the story was engaging, the world was ""alive"" enough (altough it's alive with brainded people but ok), and beautifull. The gameplay was fun for me, i could decide different styles on which i could approach situation but nothing too crazy.  Now the problems: - brainded AI... it's just not enough for a 2020 game sorry. - Awfull performance... i know it's a very good and demanding game but my god... - No choice whatsoever - The background story doesn't chgange anything... Just a lie - Combat is diverse but not deep enough  I recomend it if you get it for 40 bucks max. I hope they can make enough patches soo that they fix most of the core issues.… Expand "

Да, оптимизация была дерьмовой первое время, но мне это не помешало насладиться игрой (кроме одного момента, где меня не пускали дальше по сюжету, а ближайших сейвпоинтов не было), мне хотелось в неё возвращаться, мне хотелось исследовать мир. Впервые за всё время, пока я играю в игры, я прошла большую игру на 100%, потому что мне хотелось это сделать. Не всегда качество исполнения игры решает всё, порой достаточно замотивировать игрока к действию. Однако сейчас выяснилось, что было много вырезанного контента и вырезанного при этом почти под самый релиз (что не свойственно при создании игр), все знаю, что сдпр не умеют управлять своими ресурсами, что игра прошла через производственный ад, что она не соответствовала, в итоге, ожиданиям. Но это всё не помешало мне насладиться игрой, выпав из реального мира на два месяца. Эта игра однозначно стоила и стоит уделённого ей внимания, не потому что она продуманная до мелочей, наполненная разнообразной деятельностью, соответствует ожиданиям, не сырая, а ответственно сделанная. Нет. Потому что она оказалось, как для меня, так и для многих других, крайне душевной и с интересными персонажами, с которыми хотелось общаться, чьи задания хотелось выполнять. Она не идеальная и в этом её шарм. Многих она познакомила с миром киберпанк 2077, познакомила с первоисточником, подарила эмоции и заставила забыть о мирских проблемах. А также ещё одним плюсом игры можно выделить, что даже спустя почти год, как я не заходила в игру, я помню большую часть сюжетной линии, а также имена героев, их внешний вид, характер, сюжеты (для меня лично, это крайне редкое явление, потому что память у меня как у отшибленной, я еле могу вспомнить, что было два дня назад). Пы. Сы. Если так подумать, многие баги были смешными и злиться на них не хочется. Например, я хорошо запомнила баг, когда выходишь от Джуди и на тебя летит машина с неба, как в ГТА5.… Expand "
Renudo,"Dec 14, 2020",10," Yes, it has its mistakes and Bugs and stuff. But the most beloved games in history had these too. Yes, the marketing lied about the ps4 and xbo versions and yes this was just nasty. But the game itself was made with love and passion and you noticethis in every little detail. And every score under at least 8.5 is just a spit in the face of the people who worked on this massive project "

It still misses a decent amount of content from the promises and what they told us, what would be in the game. The Story isn't the best, the world feels lifeless and gameplay feels clunky and unfinished. For me, the game is just hot garbage. 100% Marketing, 0% Game.  i still can't believe that the same studio did the Witcher games. "

Some scenes are as if Blade Runner or Altered Carbon came to life. - Great art design. I'm a sucker for retro-futurism, and the neon-look of the game's environment, cars, etc. delivers. - Interesting and thoughtful story. IMPORTANT: if you power through only the main storyline you will miss 80-90% of the narrative content, as, indeed, many side jobs reveal much more than the main storyline. So PLAY THE SIDE MISSIONS. You will feel rewarded. Kudos to the writing team. - Keanu Reeves is yo wingman. While one can debate his dramatic acting chops he delivers the loudmouth, egoistic, unbearable-prick-yet-he-has-a-point rocker Johnny Silverhand perfectly. Also lets not forget about the rest of the cast, who all deliver memorable characters. - Great soundtrack. I'm a sucker for electronic and industrial music, too. - Interesting, I prefer this game to the Witcher. Dunno why, both are bleak in their own right. - CDPR at least gave some mod support and brought the modders on board which is a sane decision.  Cons: - Bugs. They are really annoying, even on PC. They break the immersion which is a pity in a game building so much on the atmosphere. - Limited clothing customisation options. The generated NPCs through the city wear more interesting stuff than the player character. - Release: given the buggy state of the game, had I pre-ordered the game at full price I would have been pissed, too. If the game had been released a year later and without bugs, it would be considered as one of the great games of the decade. Such a shame.  I bought the game for £40 and I consider it a good investment. Would give it 8 or 9 on the content, but the bugs and the release bring it down to a 7. If they iron out the glitches, build solid mod support, and add in DLCs in the future I would say this game still could be one that sets benchmarks in the future. Respect to Mike Pondsmith and R.

Вы правильно понимаете :  ВЫ НЕ СМОЖЕТЕ ИЗМЕНИТЬ ОБЛИК ПЕРСОНАЖА ВО ВРЕМЯ ПРОЦЕССА ИГРЫ .Никаких тату или изменение причёсок . Этого в Киберпанк Вы не сможете сделать после настройки персонажа   в начале игры . Так же стоит упомянуть оптимизацию игры на пк .

Это отдельная тема для разговора, но расскажу кратко. Сюжет это одна из самых крутых фишек в игре он очень интересный и вас затянет на долго (вот меня на 100 часов) вам будет очень интересно наблюдать за диологами между людьми или просто говорить с не РЕЛЬНЫМИ героями потому что вы как бы чувствуете его и ощущаете его и он не кажется вам бездушным и т.д. 3. Арсенал. Он здесь не очень огромны до таких масштабов как армия каких то стран, но эксклюзивные виды с разным рисунком ( точнее не перемованные с реально жизни то есть разработчики сделали всё сами) и довольно нормальным количеством модернизации. Но самое главное за главных антагонистов ( ну или промежуточных ) вы можете получить эксклюзивное оружие которое не где не купишь и так же оружие не даётся просто за убийство босса, а на определённой локации это оружие может лежать просто на тумбочке! 4. Сам открытый мир. ЭТО ПРОСТО БОМБА!! В игре присутствуют так сказать файлы где написаны разные диалоги или монологи, НО не просто так а большинство открывают почти новый сюжет и новые миссии ( в которых вы также можете  получить эксклюзивное оружие ). 5. Концовки. Концовки это в большенстве случае самый трогательны момент за всю игру ( как раз же зависит от вашего выбора в игре ) т.к. на выходе вы можете получить как и хорошую концовку но более грустную или наооборот или просто плохую очень плохую или очень хорошую или хорошую. Минусы: 1. Баги. Это самый главный минус в этой игре они также могут сломать просто прохождение одной миссии или весь сюжет то етсь вам надо будет загружать сохранение где нету этого бага 2. Концовки. Т.к. мы имеем огромное колличество персонажей так и главный или нет а точнее которых мы может найти по сюжету. И получается что они бесполезнве только ради получение эксклюзивной вещи или просто опыт и урвень репутации, и если бы их задействовали то концовой было бы не 9 а 19 ( ну если опять же зависит как вы будете разговаривать с этими персонажами ). Вывод: По мне эта игра 9~10/10, т.к. игра на самом деле сырая и выходя новые патчи раз в 1 или 2 в месяц фиксят все баги которые были, и из этого я делаю вывод что игру слишком поторопили с выпуском ей надо было просто выти где-то в 2022 года в Декабре.

The story is so stripped down, you don't even feel the urge to start again, as your choices have no real difference. Every time you make one, you never hear about it anymore. Maybe the main story. But that also is just a fake choice. Even your answers needs to be the exact same, to get the best ending.  Also creators are so lazy. I get it they had to cut transportation, even if they kinda advertised it, but honestly... Tell me in my eyes, a game in nowdays where you drive a car, and have a wast open world you can walk in is not a joke without a working AI, that handles lamps, and make cars respect The Highway Code? Since they decided to make the game first person only (aka unable to make face animations) at least i tried to feel like someone in the game, and drive how a normal person would drive. But i were the only one. Pedestrians walking on red lamps, cars stopping in front of green lights, yet crashing you on red ones.

And that's probably where the minuses all begin. Cons - 1. Very few interesting side tasks. All random encounters for some unknown reason are called side tasks. These so-called ""side tasks"" will not take you more than 2-3 minutes. And there is NOTHING interesting about them. Personally, I have identified 2 quite interesting side tasks for myself - Dream On and Sinnerman. 2. There are very few different types of weapons. Let's say you found 4 types of shotguns, do you think you will find more? No. All that you will find next is exactly the same weapon with exactly the same textures (except maybe there are several parts (the handle may be a different color - LOL) that will differ only in damage numbers and several parameters. 3. Bugs. Playing the most recent patch, I quite often had characters stuck in textures. Objects were flying in the air and so on. 4. Pretty bad endings. And all of them are bad (What's the point of me going through the game if at the end my main character still dies? ). 5. Awful cars physics. And awful car destructions. 6 Almost zero encounter with the world. ( Why almost all shops are locked??? Why can't i order food standing right to food cart?? Why i need to go to the SPECIFIC FOOD CART THAT MARKED?? ) Cyberpunk could have been an incredible game at the level of The Witcher 3, but unfortunately it did not become it. If they had delayed the release for a year or two, I think everything would have been much better. But in general, I advise you to get acquainted with this game at least for the sake of the main plot. Cyberpunk is a good game, but it is very, very far from a masterpiece… Expand "

When you look beyond the glossy polish of the game, it's just a cover shooter with a few extra gizmos. Everything that Deus Ex has been doing, except a little more of a let-down.

Witcher 3 (And its DLC) being one of my favorite and most memorable gaming enjoyments of recent years. Cyberpunk was inflated and over advertised to be this huge new game that was going to blow minds. Sadly it was nothing like it was hyped up to be and crashed very flat over all. I sat trying to keep playing the game through hours and hours in respect of CD Red and the faith in their company but I reached a point I just stopped playing without finishing the game. Before even starting into the many issues with the game, the main reason for stopping was just not being interested in the main story at all. I give the game little credit for the story not being how I expected from the endless trailers we were shown. Playing a mercenary whose main goal was to make a name for yourself just felt boring and meaningless when the game lacked connection or an interest into the world around it. Nightcity was just a playground of adult/sexual billboards or nightclubs with violence and technology thrown into a blender. One day after mindlessly doing another side quest of killing person (X) because person (Y) was going to pay me; I turned off the game and turned on another game and automatically felt happier just caring about that world. Bugs. Glitches. MORE BUGS. MORE GLITCHES. The problems were endless. Lips not moving when characters were speaking. Character models clipping through stationary objects that would cause random things to fly around. Several points of audio just being absent. Looting radius for items being completely broken or away from the actual object laying on the ground. Quest givers (or Fixers in Cyberpunk) being lagged behind the quest you are working on, giving you dialogue from a previous quest you already did. I personally ran into a couple game breaking bugs that made the game impossible to play or advance in till a patch was released several days later. Skin textures clipping off character models during small cutscenes. The list could go on and on for the issues with this game. This game wasn't all bad and offered some neat skill trees for their minimal RPG element. Hacking gameplay was fun and thematic to the game while weapons were fun to play around with. But not much else stood out about this game and I doubt I'll ever pick it back up after many content patches are released. I don’t blame the whole company for this disaster that was shipped to us. I blame the financial/marketing team for pushing out a game that was not ready. I also blame the public for being so greedy nowadays and not wanting to wait for something to come out. You can tell this was a passion project by CD RED that if given the full time it needed could have been an interesting game but instead was forced to rush the game and cut so much content from the game.… Expand "

Absorbing the atmosphere, slowly going from place to place, meeting interesting people, buying cars, clothing and houses - it's the best part of this game. But for me personally the main story was just bad... There were some awesome ideas and characters but only few. The story was short and felt shallow inside, the choices That we can make are 90% of time useless. Optimalization of this game is a total nonsense... It's crushing and slowing down fps all the time even on lowest settings I don't know why. Leveling system was unintelligible for me. Map of the town was unreadable. Crafting system ware useless.

After advancing half of the story, I grew so tired of mindlessly butchering mobs that I began to hate the main characters - which have caused me to not see the ending I desired to see (i.e Rogue)  Nevertheless, the scenes and 'smell' of Night City was something that worth seeing again and I will come back later just to visit the places I loved.… Expand "

The graphics and the main story are quite spectacular, however and unfortunately, it's not enough for me.  A game feeling from 10 years ago (FarCry 3 is more polished), mediocre physics (errors and more errors), mediocre driving, mediocre immersion, mediocre city, mediocre role elements, mediocre animations...The map is not like RDR2 or Witcher, where you feel the immensity and infinite possibilities. You can run around the city for hours without extraordinary events or strange appearances (apart from bugs). This is just a cool (and death) city to make pics, nothing else.  It was a very bad decision not to put a third-person mode in a game where aesthetics are so important, or at least in conversations, to come out in third-person mode and see the character talk, gesture, etc, something like Mass Effect. It's incredible that the only place we can see this is in the mirror of our house, that disconnected me a lot from the experience (notice that the third-person mod is garbage, in case someone thinks it fixes it).  The duality with Keanu is something original although I didn't love it, I like to identify myself and connect with the characters, a dual character complicates that task for me. On the other hand, the fact of finding out that you are dying so soon hurts the game for me, it does not make any sense to buy cars or motorcycles or houses if you are desperate to cure yourself or find a solution to your chip. The only thing I want in those circumstances is to beat the game quickly. (In RDR2 you get tuberculosis when you go to 80% of the game, that's well in place to speed up the end, but in the rest of the game, please let me enjoy for God's sake)  This game lacked a lot of care, attention and dedication, the truth is that I don't understand what they did for so long and so many extensions because the game gives a lot of feeling of being incomplete.  I see The Witcher 3 and then I see Cyberpunk and I don't understand anything...  Let's hope the guys from CDProject get back on track.… Expand "

It’s also worth mentioning that the main story from my perspective, just became too “all over the place” and I found I started skipping most of the dialogue after a while as It went off on all sorts of tangents, with people and events I didn’t know anything about.

However, it would have been even better if they made it longer. The graphics of the game looked really stunning, especially wandering around the city at night was a whole different experience. The side quests in the game were really enjoyable, sometimes even more fun than the main quests. CDPR is already great at designing side quests, and they have improved themselves even more after The Witcher. It would have been better if they had developed the artificial intelligence more in the game; in my opinion, the AI felt quite weak. I didn't like the police chases in the game, as it was easy to escape or when we shot NPCs, they would teleport right next to us when our wanted level increased. They could have implemented a better system for that. I played the game long after its release with good pc setup, so I didn't encounter many optimization issues, bugs, or glitches. It's somewhat normal for major games to have significant bug problems when they are first released because making a game is not an easy task, and they gradually fix the bugs to improve the game. On one hand, players had excessively high expectations for this game, and when they saw the bugs upon its release, they got very angry due to the overhype. I think the game is in a good state now. I completed the game in 110 hours (Main quests + Side quests + Extra content), and my game only crashed once. I had a few minor issues, like my character's head turning black a couple of times.

Personally, I expected a full finished product that would contain at least the majority of the systems and featuresThere might not be anything I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. I made an account to review it anyway, because I was just as excited as everyone else for its release. Maybe significantly moreso.Many people's expectations may have been too high. Personally, I expected a full finished product that would contain at least the majority of the systems and features advertised. That is not what I got. I understand that many things will be cut out and reworked in the process of game development. This is inevitable. I was not blind to the ""does not represent final product"" warning labels in the teasers and trailers. However, most of the time this message is viewed positively. It implies the game will be more polished, more fleshed out, and more complete than what you're seeing.In cyberpunk's case, they cut out the game itself. That warning message acted as a shield against accountability rather than a promising reassurance that the game would get better. Intentional or not. This is not an RPG. Cyberpunk 2077 is a mediocre mess. A heartbreaking one. It absolutely shines in a few areas, is passable in many, and is absolutely embarrassing in some. The story, although good and even emotionally impactful at times, suffers from the poor choice made to cut out what was likely going to be an additional act to the game in favor of an odd and unsatisfying montage summarization. How much was actually cut from the story I'll never know, but there is something huge missing here especially and I felt it. Like losing an arm but constantly being treated as though I'd never had two in the first place. V is not your character. Most of your choices are meaningless. V will frequently say things with no input from you that destroys any vision of what or who your character is to you. Unless "" douchey street kid"" is what you envisioned. V is a vehicle for you to experience Johnny's story and the stories of the other characters around you. Who, admittedly, are mostly very good. The customization is just okay. A shadow of what it could have been. Then again, what is the point of customization when you almost never see your character in any meaningful way? Third person cutscenes are almost entirely nonexistent. You can look in mirrors, but why? It happens twice naturally in the story, and half the time pieces of clothing or hair won't load in properly. Mirrors would be a nice little addition if they didn't remind me that the character I spent my time creating may as well be imaginary unless I bend over a bathroom sink and stare at him doing nothing. The city is the most beautiful city ever made in a video game. It's also completely shallow and boring beyond being a set piece to do missions in. They sprinkled in a few secrets and scripted events, but not many and not enough to satisfy, it only makes me want more. The police and A.I. in npcs is extremely bad. This has been said many times by people more knowledgable and well spoken than me, but it absoltely cannot be overstated and should be yelled out from the rooftops at any opportunity. It is embarrassing and almost insulting. This can never be okay in a full priced game. Ridiculous. Unbelievable. This is a lopsided, gutted, abused 6/10 game that is treading water solely on the talent that surrounds it. The art, the music, the acting and writing (in most cases) prop up this husk of a shell of a game and allow it to be something I would consider worth playing. No amount of bug fixes will improve its score beyond a 7. What this game needs is meat. Features. Activities. Repair. Remodeling. So much about it feels incomplete and butchered that it screams out to anyone paying attention that it was meant to be something very different. There is a 9/10 experience somewhere in this mess. They have the foundation. Will updates and dlc transform this game over the years and turn it into a product that's not only flashy and cool but SATISFYING? I don't know enough about game development to understand what they can or can't do to fix this. Or if they'll even try or recognize what's broken. But I hope they do. My heart sank at the end of my playthrough when the honeymoon phase ended and it began to sink in just how much of this game was missing. For every bit of fun I had, there were 2 somber realizations that I couldn't do or see something that I wanted to or was told I could. Cyberpunk is a lot like the hurried montage it used to replace an entire act of the game. Flashy and full of good characters, but hollow and unsatisfying. No video game has ever let me down more than this one. I remain optimistic about its future, however, and hope both CDRED and the people who trusted them end up as happy with the outcome as possible.… Expand "

It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful.  With moments you NEVER find in video games.  But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is.

Johnny's confrontational relationship with V and the eventual growth between them is the anchor of this story as they struggle to find a solution to the shared mess they find themselves in.  https://shrinke.me/Cyberpunk2077GameplayPC… Expand "

And even thou i was playing on PS4 Pro with 4K optimization ON, the game was working pretty smoothly... Loading was fast, no FPS drops...

Lastly, even if the game was not in this rough of a state, I would have still given it a 7 or 8 (basically penalizing 2 or 3 points) because of the lies they sold us pre-launch, coupled with the fact that they knew what they were doing, but chose to not be forthright and ""forced"" reviewers  (although they are partly to blame as well, especially the 10/10 ones...come on!! seriously? ) to not show their own footage and also withhold any info regarding the console versions.

This is the first time I felt compelled to write a review about a game for fellow gamers and the developers in CD Projekt Red Studio. A journey that with amazing start, tedious and buggy route and 5 end games mixed with wow, regrets, contemplation and self-reflection.  Let's be honest, the gaming mechanism of this game is far from perfect. Sure the customization of your genitals is interesting. But I'd rather play and experience a game that allows you to look into the mirror(literally) and ask the hard questions.  CD Projekt Red is THE most culturally aware company in the industry. There is almost no, if any culture appropriation in the game, commonly seen in other titles by studios from US or Europe. It is a surprise beyond pleasant for a Chinese player like me to be immersed in a world that is so thoroughly localized. Voice acting is amazing and the auto-translating feature on NPC is a stroke of genius.  It's only fittingly ironic, for a game illustrating a corporate world where even Johnny Silverhand had to escape from after his second chance, to be a glimpse to the future and mirror to the present where its developers suffer from overwork for the benefit of the corporation.  Thank you, Cyberpunk 2077. I wish I would have the courage to reflect what I have done and decide how to spend the rest of my life, had I only got 6 months to live. Replaying this game would be on the bucket list, should that be the case.  But, please, just please, give us a perfect ending in the DLC before that happens.

And I absolutely love it for what it is. It had been years since a game that pushed PC hardware to it limits, had stepped in. Not only is the game a resource hound but tons of fun to play. I didn't have much hope left in AAA games - out comes Cyberpunk 2077 smashing all sorrows regarding the same.  If not for the graphic card swallowing visuals, there's one thing that you should play this game for - is the lore! When you think about the time CDPR has taken to make this game, it's the absolute firm base of lore that they establish for players to be in - this isn't sci-fi GTA as many are mistaking it - it's a more detailed and vast Dues Ex world. Just how they've done with the Witcher 3 - Cyberpunk 2077's world creates a very strong presence and mood for the player to be in - countless times while wandering the streets of Night City I forget that I'm in a  for this game is that it presents the most next to possible future that mankind might eventually encounter - I've just crossed the interlude doing a mix of side quests and few main quests in between and the game boasts it's deep thought-out world really well. They don't focus on a cliche sci-fi future - they present to you it's demons, it's ghosts, it's best and it's worst in so much detail and it feels so so familiar to so many elements of today that it establishes a strong sense of fear, resentment and excitement for a future that our present might lead upto.  People out there might be mocking CDPR for making a game that doesn't run well on old gen consoles but Cyberpunk 2077 is a game changer that many will come to love as many of them hate because the amount of time they've taken has purely gone into making a world that you relate to - can see **** version of future closer to our reality. I'm from India and while taking a stroll in Night City, countless times I've came across areas that resemble places that I've been in New Delhi and Bangalore! Means somewhere there's a sense of unified vision of what a homely place in your city might look like, Every area is distinct - has a different aura to it - you'll know when you're in Japan Town - you'll know when you're in Pacifica - Nothing is just duplicated around - it's a very organic handcrafted world that hate to come out of! It's hard to put down the controller once you start playing as Punk of future streets!  Yes, the game has bugs, but nothing game-breaking, few ones I encountered were more of Skyrim types : laugh-and-move-on types, which will eventually get patched anyway - CDPR has been rolling out patches back-to-back. It's a must play for lovers of RPGs.… Expand "

Lifepath is one of them, not only it's disappointingly short, it doesn't really affect the story as much as they hyped it up. All you get for choosing different lifepath is just an extra dialog that doesn't affect the gameplay and nothing more. It's as deep as a puddle. That's my main grip, there's a lot more problem with this game that others have pointed out, and I agree with all of them.The AI is is more A than I, with cops spawning and multiplying literally 3 meters behind you, NPCs only have one reaction to violence which is crouch in fear, cars are driving on rails with no traffic AI. Character customization is too basic for an RPG game, no sliders, can't edit character post creation, can't transfer stats on fashion item. Imagine being in a world that's all about making personal statement and having your character walk the world like a clown just to have good stats. Inventory system and crafting system need an overhaul, currently there's no need to craft something that takes multiple hard to get parts since you get always get something better from world drops. You can carry dozens of rifles and shotguns on your pocket, this makes the stash on V's apartment and car storage irrelevant. List goes on and on, there's a lot of missing basic feature that is overlooked and bad design enough to distract you from immersing into the world.This game isn't an RPG first game that was promised by the CDPR 2 years ago, it's something else completely different.

So first and main cool part of this game its probably an art style yeah i mean all this cyberpunk things (corporation that think only about money not about peoples life, all this debauchery and neon signboards). second one - it's bunch of different ways you can play the game (stealth, hacking or my favorite simple run and shoot). so if have option to pick your own play style you also have ability to grab that type of weapon that can exactly fit in your playstyle (i mean if you wanna stealth pick pistol with silencer or melee weapon  if run and gun pick shotgun, assault rifle or what ever you want). you also have ability to craft weapons from trash or increase stats on already available and don't forget to level up your own character stats and abilities. but what about story telling in this game? so it dramatic story about you and ""little"" friend Johnny with a lot of explosions shoots and fun. also side quests on high level of elaboration thanks to CD Projekt Red Studio, every side quest that i pick up and complete was on main quest level with it own different story that somehow connected with main quest. finally that game have more than 3 different ending and it is a great plus (especially in modern realities). so will i recommend this game? probably yeah but wait until developers release bunch of patches that will fix this game may be you will get this game with discount and it will be another plus for you =3… Expand "

Luckily, I later managed to get my hands on a Xbox Series X which ran the game far better and I managed to continue my playthrough. It is still unforgivable that it ran so poorly on Xbox One. As I continued my playthrough, despite me enjoying the game a lot, there were numerous annoying bugs that were distracting and at times straight up annoying. There were also many design decisions, specifically when it comes to loot, customization and crafting, that boggled my mind and are just not well done.

The draw distance is good, but there is some really significant pop-in, which is most noticeable when travelling in a car or on a bike.  The difference in how much time was spent on the main and side characters versus the NPCs is also very obvious and quite jarring. Main characters such as Jackie Welles, Judy Alvarez, etc are all very detailed and have clearly been given a lot of time and effort, but your average citizen of Night City is quite low detail and quite often I'd see exact replica NPCs standing next to each other in a crowd.  Beyond the graphics I think there are some real problems with this game, and the worrying thing is that some of it is probably beyond fixing. There are a lot of bugs and minor issues, such as clipping, items floating in mid-air, cars sinking into the floor, etc, all of which will be fixed in updates. Beyond that there are problems with a lack of interaction with your average NPC, and a physics engine that is poor even when compared to the 7 year old GTAV. However, for me the biggest problem is that this game seems to only superficially be an RPG. Yes, the game features stats, character attributes that you can unlock and mods that can be applied to guns to change the damage output, but beyond the first 15-20 minutes none of the dialogue choices really seem to make a difference to the outcome of game events, which is a major issue for an RPG. At the start of the game you choose between playing as Nomad, Street Kid or Corpo. Sometimes in dialogue you'll get a different choice pop up depending on which character start you chose, but ultimately none of it seems to make a difference to the outcome of the conversation.  I feel like CP2077 has a really cool setting, with a nicely designed if quite shallow city, and the graphics can be really impressive at times, but ultimately I think the game is really disappointing.… Expand "

Just very minor annoyances but tend to be pretty funny. It is really almost impossible to have a huge open world RPG without that happening in this day and age just with the amount of code and animations and scripting that needs to be done. So bottom line is it’s a great game with a couple of bugs. Note that the game works fine with ps4 but best with ps5 and there is quite a notable difference with the amount of stutters.

Storyline is fantastic, with a lot of choices that changes the behaviour of the City. Also the game did something no other game managed to: When it came to few in-game choices, I sat for couple of minutes scratching my head, trying to weight what the outcomes are going to be, and how the characters I care about will be affected. Truly genious design.  Speaking of design. Design of the city is a MASTERPIECE. Seriously. Richness of all the buildings, interiors, all little details in bars, clubs, hotels, penthouses, megablocks, crackhead places, guns and cars... I honestly don't know how they managed to pull off something that BIG, looking that good. In game graphics are very next-gen, with absolutely stunning views and moments. I spent way too long in Photo Mode, taking hundreds of pictures. Architecture in this game, with the attention to detail is truly one in it's kind. Never seeen something like this before. And probably never will.  Then comes the music and sounds design. Now that's a treat. I don't know what kind of audio engineering sorcery was used to create in-clubs sound, but they sound like ACTUAL clubs. When you walk in the club and you're in the corridor, you hear only the bass coming from the walls. It gradually changes as you walk in to the dancefloor, with all the reverb of a REAL dance hall, that changes as you walk on the floor, from one speaker to another. Seriously, it sounds like reality. Blew my mind couple of times!  Gunplay is great. Side stories are like main story, and I strongly encourage everyone not to rush the main storyline, but to just dwelve in the heartbeat of the Night City, by completing all the little side quests and contracts. They are better than most of the main storylines of other games, so yeah, just do them, trust me on this one.

Bugs aside, the game is just boring. It has potential, but it is let down by a linear storyline that doesn't play out as an exciting story, but rather as if someone added completely unnecessary steps to extend the gameplay. Most main and side quests feel completely pointless - if you fast-forward through the whole 2-hour-long quest and get a one-sentence summary of what happened, you wouldn't miss a thing. Quests don't give you choices; they don't influence your character; you just go through a linear sequence of steps without much engagement or thinking - click here, go here, open this, bring it here. After 30 minutes of playing Cyberpunk, I found myself fast-forwarding (thanks for adding that feature, btw) through all dialogues - they are just meaningless, emotionless fluff added to the game to extend playtime.  Typical RPG stuff, such as crafting, don’t add much to the game. Instead, the game comes down to pointless wandering in an empty world without any meaning or purpose. It gets very repetitive after a few hours.  There are beautiful scenes – I liked the designs of the Tarot cards are the work of art – but the came itself doesn’t live up to the hype or its potential.… Expand "

So far I would give it a 7/10 but since there are so many haters around and since this game deserves some love I'm giving it a 10 (if CD Project Red goes broke, they won't fix the game).  Full review :  Night City is probably the most visually stunning environment I have seen in a game. The problem is, that's about all this game has going for it. Yes it looks amazing, but a lot of thing are currently lacking.  Let's start with the character customization. In all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this game would be about. What we got, however, was unremarkable. Aside from customizable genitals (which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character) this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games. Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. In terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. To make matters even worse, once you've created your V, that's it. You can't change your appearance any more. Despite the fact that the ads implied in Night City, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. Not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics.  The next thing I want to talk about is character choice. Aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over V's personality or choices. V essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. For example, I chose Corpo as my lifepath. After the very first introductory mission, V went from being a cold, calculating Corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. I had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes.  The world itself was also a let down. I went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. But what I found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. Yes there are tons of NPCs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. It is completely static, and the AI leaves a lot to be desired. As many have already pointed out, the AI seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. That's it. The police AI are a complete joke. If you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. In the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere.  I found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.  I was also disappointed with V's apartment. You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. On top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. Yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. I also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. You spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point A to point B.  Everything I listed this far can be fixed (except for the V's personality part I guess), like hairdressers were added in the witcher3 with a DLC, they can and should do the same for this game. Changing your apartment in the game could also be an easy fix, the game doesn't lack empty buildings. The AI can also be fixed, having the police chase you with cars should not be too complicated to do and so on...  I still believe this game can be turned into the masterpiece we are all waiting for, just stay tuned.… Expand "

In the beginning I was amazed by the really nice graphics (Ray Tracing Ultra), the story and Night City, only to get disappointed later on.  If you only play the main story and some of the important side missions, you will not notice the serious weaknesses of the game.  The longer you explore the open world, the more disappointed you become. CDPR has announced a next generation game with incredibly interesting features. Unfortunately, only a fraction of it has been implemented in the current version.  At the moment, it feels more like an early access than a finished game.  The main story was interesting but didn't really blow my mind, reminds you of Ghost in the Shell and Altered Carbon and maybe a bit of Blade Runner. But unfortunately nothing innovative and new.  Pros: - Graphics - Night City as a scenery - Story - Sound (weapons, vehicles, world) - First person (relatively well executed, gunplay feels good) - German synchronization  Cons: - Gameplay (RPG mechanics, inventory) - RPG downgraded to Action Adventure - Linearity (story) - AI (one of the worst) - Open World (Night City feels more like a scenery) - Police system - No real side activities - Lots of missing promised features  Bottom line: if you play the main story and do a couple of side missions, cyberpunk feels fine, but once you step into the open world, you start to notice how incomplete the game is. It feels like an Early Access version at times. Most of all, it's disappointing that the promised RPG masterpiece just turned into an average action adventure.  And then there are the moments when Cyberpunk 2077 reaches its full potential. If you simply drive through Night City with the relatively cool vehicles and forget all the game flaws for a moment, the real potential of this game opens up, which cannot be matched by any GTA. Because when it comes to atmosphere, scenery and just that Cyberpunk feeling, Cyberpunk 2077 is unsurpassed! Unfortunately then you become aware of the missed potential, which makes you even sadder.  There is a masterpiece somewhere hidden in this game. Due to the release rush, you can see and feel how unfinished this game was released. I just hope now that CDPR is still delivering the game they promised us. Because with this release they have lost their reputation and, even worse, the trust of their community.… Expand "

I was not disapointed, at all. I expected a good RPG game, and I certainly got it.  CDPR does something different every time. I can't put my finger on it, but like with the Witcher, they build on something we've all played before, but it feels like a new kind of game. Cyberpunk is a classic 1st person RPG, yet it steel feels like something entirely new.  Night City feels like a real city. The people there feels like real people. I don't think I've ever been this immersed since Skyrim, and this is a huge step up from that feeling. The attention to detail, every single location feels real.  The guns, the enemies, the cars, the music, the environment, even on my RX Vega 64 on the lower medium settings it looks awesome. I can't wait to boot it up with a more beefy graphics card when the times comes.  I've just completed the main story, and I'm now gonna play through the entire game again. I just can't get enough of it.  Sure, there are bugs. How can you create a world this big and iron out all the bugs? I have no idea, I don't think anyone can. Remember Skyrim?

Stealth system is fairly conventional, but it makes sense with the rpg aspects in play, where a stat determines your effectiveness. The game could have used a bit more time in the oven, but that's true about nearly all open world games at this scale.

Music and sound design cannot hold a candle compared to like ""Vampire Masquerade Bloodlines"".  Gameplay: Streamlined (for the limited nature of consoles). I am playing on the highest difficulty .. and it is way, WAAY too easy. Not in terms of taking damage or NPCs being sponges .. but in terms of very, very predictable and simple AI. Especially the AI is lacking very much - it seems at LEAST a decade behind comparable open world titles.  Customization: Nice - cannot complain  Conclusion: I like it. But it is no epiphany of any kind. It is not a masterpiece .. but falls more in line with the likes of Fallout 4. Much better than average .. but far, far from the top to become a classic.

Component crafting is nearly useless without disabling craftting times. Mechanical enemies drop components that you can't pick up. Some sections are rail roaded and force you into combat no matter how stealthy a netrunner you are.  Overall, I really liked it and would say its the best game I played in 2020.

Also, this review comes with about 30 hours of gameplay, but I haven't finished it yet as it's massive.  Technical: Let's be honest, I played this game on PC, and while I haven't had an glitches, for some reason I have had multiple technical issues despite building a computer in 2020. This game is exceedingly poorly optimized for lower-mid tier computers. Which is odd given reasonable file size. Despite having ray tracing on my graphics card and running every other game on max settings, my computer can't run Ray tracing on Cyberpunk and gets massive frame drops when doing the racing missions, even with DLSS turned on. The graphics and level of details are very pretty when they work, but you'll need like a 2-4k computer to run them which makes them more of a snub at everyone than a feature.  World: Absolutely stunning. There's so many different levels to the world here, there's steam and smoke. Cops arresting people, random side-missions galore. My only issue is that they need a way to help organize all of the content. The cop programming makes 0 sense. They just spawn whenever you do a crime. One time I killed a ripper doc who was murdering people in their own hideout to chop them up for parts. The police spawned INSIDE the hideout and started shooting at me.  Story: Haven't completed yet, but rather stereotypical thus far for Cyberpunk, still really enjoying it. I like seeing all of the layers the different characters have, my only issue is that thus far I'm not seeing much character progression, but that's a very common issue in video games.  Gameplay: Cars suck on keyboard and mouse. Gunplay and melee are both fine. The tutorials practically might as well not have bothered they're so bad (looking at you hacking mini-game tutorial). The tutorial for leveling up doesn't even exist, and it really should. One of my biggest beefs is also that you can't just go to a menu you need, then back out. You have to open the main menu, to open the sub menu, then back out of each one at a time rather than just having a get-back-to-the-action button. Also, there's little to no ""RPG"" element to it like they had in The Witcher. i.e., you don't have much if any character agency. Your options are usually Be a jackass, be a rude jackass, be a smartass and a jackass, and be a loveable jackass and a pushover.  Ambiance: Really part of the world, but it's so freaking good I'm making it it's own quality. The attention to detail, and look really make you feel like you're there.  Audio/Music: Audio design is far too subtle for things like footsteps etc. I had to crank most volume down to half to even hear them. Music is fine, but nothing special.  Breakdown Technical:    6/10 World:    9/10 Story:    9/10 Gameplay:    7/10 Ambiance:    11/10 Audio/Music:  8/10 Overall (Me):   9/10 Overall:    8/10… Expand "

They cannot even begin to fathom the hard core level of work that needs to be done to make even this broken version of the game playable.  The best part is I know CDPR are going to absolutely balance and finalize this masterpiece to infinity and beyond. Just wait 'til multiplayer starts. hehe. People have no clue where this game is going. The engine itself is groundbreaking, and will forever change the landscape of quality triple A titles. Even with all the brokenness and bugs, I was able to finish the main story line and 50-60% of side quests within a few weeks. Game of the year for sure, no doubt in my mind.

I am incredibly disappointed in how CDPR has handled the marketing and release for this game. The trailers and previews in hindsight look flat out shady and dishonest, to the point of feeling like a scam, frankly. I fully trusted them but it feels like they were playing me for an idiot all along.  Almost all of the gameplay trailer content has been taken from very tiny, specific areas of the game in order to selectively hype gameplay features that are pretty much all cut from the game at release. Even the ""story"" trailers dub dialogue over tiny scenes from the game to falsely create the impression that much more is going on than actually happens in the game.  Now don't get me wrong - there are some areas of the game that are great. The city design is amazing visually, and impressive in terms of size. But the game itself, the actual AI routines and so on are very disappointing. The city is dead. A perfect example is gangs. Criminals will just stand on street corners and basically ignore you, even when you walk right up to them. These are supposed to be violent street muggers!  By far the biggest let down for me is the ""next-gen branching storyline"". It simply doesn't exist! You sit for literally hours on end talking to characters, yet nothing you say makes any difference at all. It's absolutely bizarre. Developers spent months doing interviews excitedly gushing about how much you can change the story with things you say to people, and then the actual story itself in-game feels almost 100% linear.  In fact, the dialogue can even feel insulting. Characters will ask you to make big important decisions, the game gives you a choice...and then literally nothing happens as a result. Things just happen as they would have anyway. It's really annoying and it makes all the hype seem like flat out lies.  On top of that, anything else that offers you choice, like ""non lethality"" is also pointless. You can knock characters unconscious and other characters will talk about how they're dead. Stupid.  CDPR seem content to sit back now and become the next EA. A company that lies to their customers and doesn't care about them. They have completely lost the moral high ground over other companies that they used to boast about.… Expand "

It isn’t much of an RPG, as there are only 3 things in the entire game that effect the way the story plays out. The game world feels hollow and there is pretty much nothing to do in the world aside from shooting gang members over and over. The AI is less advanced than some ps2 era games and is laughable at best. And the story is so haphazardly constructed that I don't even know what story they were trying to tell. The game as a whole just feels like it's caught in this awkward middle ground, where it tries to do many different things, but doesn't do any of them particularly well aside from the visuals. It also isn't a damn cyberpunk game, as traditional cyberpunk themes are absent and you spend half of the game helping the cops or corpos. Soooo ""Punk"" CDPR. However while it is a disappointing game, It's not a bad one. It's kinda just ""Okay"". There are some fun missions and the shooting is pretty solid so it's certainly not the worst way to spend your time. And if you're looking for a game to just go in a shoot some things, while staring at a beautiful environment, then this is a solid option.

Geo_Gaming,"Dec 22, 2020",6," Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that encompasses aspects of other games and media and struggles to find its own identity.

CD Projekt Red’s vision and scope may have been far grander at one time, but the “finished” product, when not broken or buggy, is missing the magic of a Witcher game or a full RPG experience.  It touches on a little of everything and fears going any further. It feels afraid of taking any stance, righting any wrongs, or (at times) giving the player the option for better outcomes. From the developers that brought you the “Family Matters” quest with the Botchling, it’s surprising that the game can’t decide what it wants to be. A fleeting momentary mention of a trans character, tons of death and suicide, love interests based solely on body choice, and an 80’s version of the corporate world compressed into one man. Like a list of topics to add a checkmark to, Cyberpunk 2077 is home to a thousand ideas, few of which ever truly follow a worthwhile path.  When it works, it’s a beautiful open world with much to explore, but you won’t be introduced to any of it. If you simply want to enjoy the games true stories and experiences, you will find very little by following the main quests. Instead, you will need to explore the game, on your own, and partake in your own quest line. I would recommend following guides to help you finish major side quests which are so vital to the story and even the ending, that your entire view of the game will be based off of them far more than any single main quest.  By the end of this review, I’ve reached 150+ hours on PC, and around 60+ on PS5. Throughout my time I found countless bugs, glitches, even game breaking instances. Right now, I can’t even finish a completionist run because a quest simply won’t work. I’ve taken hundreds of pictures, many of bugs, but also of beauty. I feel that Cyberpunk 2077 was a vision of the future that for whatever reasons simply couldn’t be fulfilled. Whether it was time, or tech, or management, the game launched as it did to deserved criticism.  While update after update won’t fix the consumer confidence or previous experiences, I truly hope the game is fixed and expanded. Because whatever vison they did have in making it, I can see it in its “bones” everywhere in game. I’m excited by the future prospects of the game, just as I was for No Man’s Sky, and despite my fairly awful experiences I’m still optimistic. I wish them the best in their endeavor and hope to experience their full vision again someday, with a clear mind, and renewed excitement.… Expand "

MamaWelles,"Dec 15, 2020",8," Simply the best game atmosphere ever.  Atmosphere 10/10  Night city is truly a masterpiece of a city.

Atmosphere 10/10 Night city is truly a masterpiece of a city. It provides an atmosphere you've never witnessed in any other game before, particularly during night. The city is dense, with many vehicles on the streets (could be more on the highway) and a lot of people walking around, although there is almost no interaction between NPCs unfortunately. Every part of the city is filled with extreme detail and the lighting is stellar, especially with raytracing enabled. 10/10 without a doubt.  Story/side quests 8/10 Halfway through the main quest flow, the story is good and you definitely want to see what's coming next. Side quests range from boring to very fun to play. Overall, I like the quests in GTA more as they offer more versatile and crazy tasks. Aside from the opening, the three life paths have very little effect on the game. I expected many sidequests exclusively to every life path that deal with the background of V and cover the the respective life path in depth (e.g. corporate rivalry, nomad rivalry). This is quite disappointing to me.  AI 6/10 The AI is mixed. Neutral NPCs, when shot, sometimes do not run away or leave their car and crouch forever. Police always spawns out of nowhere when doing some criminal activity (e.g. shooting a random NPC) which is awful and has to be fixed. Enemies however seem to have very little issues so far, but they are nothing special either. They hide and shoot, throw grenades, hack your mind and sometimes rush to your hiding position. That's it. Some of them have a bug and act like a scarecrow, standing there with arms stretched out and doing nothing. Some enemies with fists only do not attack you and just try to defend your punches. Both effects are rather rare though.  Gameplay 8/10 This is an unpopular opinion, but the gun play feels good and is realistic. You cannot shoot an enemy precisely in the head from mid-distance without using the sight or scope. This should be the way to go for games that aim at mimicking realistic gameplay. Firing weapons sounds amazing and is a lot of fun. There are a bunch of different melee- and range-weapons, grenades and skills to level. Adding the hacking abilities gives a versatile playing style. More weapon modifications and special-effects would be welcomed though. Driving feels terrible once you start the game as steering overshoots compared to other games, which leads to too much drifting. After a few hours of gameplay however, you are used to it and driving also makes a lot of fun, especially with fast cars and during night.  Other negative aspects: -  character-styling options are too few. You cannot set the height and weight of V and there also too few options for hairstyle, skin color, hair color etc. - Clothing: If you want to dress with the best items, you most likely look like a clown. CDPR should implement clothing that better fits to each other. - Craft/Loot: Crafting is nothing you are very excited for. Loot is okay, but you'd be more hyped for a boss if weapons of higher rarity had unique special effects. - Other tasks in night city become repetitive quite fast - Difficulty: Sometimes the game is too easy even on the hardest mode. Those are all, if at all, minor points.  Bugs Yes there are bugs, and there are a lot of them, which cannot be all listed here. Many of them are minor bugs that occur very infrequently (e.g. NPC having a gun sticking in their head or others moving weirdly), but summed together, there are still too many of them. More often however are... ... textures of cars not loading fast enough which obviously dampens the atmosphere. ...cars and NPCs suddenly spawning out of nowhere. ...cars spawning inside other cars, causing some mixture of an explosion and a crash and making cars jump 3 meters in the air...??? But that bug seems to be very rare at least. ...sometimes clicking Q to change from first- to third-person while driving is delayed or bugged.  Overall, the game is very much recommended, at least on PC with good hardware. What makes the game special and possibly the game best ever is not the interaction with its open world but the atmosphere and stories. You will most likely exceed 100 hours of gameplay. If CDPR removes the bugs, the game is an easy 10/10.… Expand "

Daizerdaizer,"Dec 11, 2020",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          The game is absolutely amazing for the following reasons:1. Story and character arc is great.. how V transitions in dialog and get different lines depending on the character upgrade is genius2. Main mission and side mission are always dynamic and fun, even the silly Delamine car retrieving, missions are super fun.3. Weapon upgrades and, cyberware / cyberhacks are pretty nice, in all missions you'll need to do a combination of stealth and combat (gun fire or physical).4. It's dynamic and not repetitive like other RPG games where you'll know exactly what to do and just grind to level up your character.Sure the game has more to offer down the road but I would not butcher 8 years of work for a couple of posts... The Devs promised more updates and they are working on it... For me personally, I can see my self putting in endless hours with or without the update material... It's super fun and this is what matters...Sorry for the long review but someone had to leave good feedback as this game deserves it.… Expand "

I have only played version/update 6 of the game.  So, imagine a m ix of: 1) GTA Vice 3/Vice City/5 (strong story, gangs in the streets, driving cars/motorcycles, crimes, wanted levels, cops, weapons, and a large city with crowds and traffic), 2) Spiderman 2 ( a few kinds of combat quests sprinkled all over the map), 3) Outer Worlds (fast travel; dystopian world; stores selling food, weapons, or medicine; futuristic setting/weapons; first-person shooter; and crafting break down of weapons), 4) and The Witcher 3 (crafting and mission style, a prostitute although The Witcher had more).  Despite its issues, this is an amazing open world dystopian experience, with extensive crafting capabilities.  The story is excellent, top marks. There are some English language typos throughout the game, but nothing horrendous.  The game could use the following improvements: bugs, controls (especially vehicles), vehicle diversity, AI (traffic, crowds, and enemies), NPC diversity (more drug dealers, prostitutes, etc.), increased crafting system power, and menu navigation controller button mapping.  A few bugs are pervasive throughout gameplay, but none of them break the game permanently or ruined immersion for me.  All-in-all, worth a purchase.… Expand "

Some game mechanics like NPCs, stealth takedowns, driving AI, coliision and police system are so bad, they are 10 years late. Side activity is non-existent outside of ""kill everyone in the building and take a shard"", Far Cry 2 had more variety there. Everybody says ""but the soundtrack was really good"" which really puzzles me, because it feels like a random youtube mix, from rap to growl, of all things. Lifepaths dont mean anything after prologue, I remember maybe 3 quests where my lifepath gave me a separate meaningful choice, and not just another dialogue option that would have the same consequences as another one. Crafting is abysmal, it is so bad, I had to modify system files to make it at least look like a bearable activity. I have no idea, why there are so many consumables and especially alcohol, never used one. I started recorfing different bugs and glitches halfway through my playthough, and by the end of it I have 4 GBs of short videos and several dozen screenshots. And the promised ""vibrant Night City"" is just a bunch of completely useless icons like drop points and food stalls slapped on lifeless buildings that have nothing on them. Oh yeah, and I really tried to read all those shards that are supposed to contain lore and interesting facts, but got really bored real soon. I wonder why they put so much effort into that instead of, i don't know, side activities or police system?  What i liked: perks system. Mostly irrelevant, because whatever you do, you can just pick up or craft a good gun and destroy everyone with headshots. But it is really noticeable how your choices make a difference as soon as you pick them up. Unfortunately, the perks progression system is a total garbage, I finished the main story and all side quests, and I only have my crafting maxed. I dont plan on running around the city hacking everything just to level up my breach or quickhacking or fighting thugs to level up melee, so Im missing out on something.  Main story - its ok. Not the greatest story in the world, but not Fallout 4 or MEA either. Rather predictable, but execution is good. Voice acting is great, one of the best I've heard in videogames. Felt like Pixar level of effort. Romantic questlines are very interesting, the only reason for me personally to play this game again is to see through romantic storyline with Panam.  Overall this is just a very mediocre looter-shooter that feels outdated on release. I dont know how they plan to fix it, this game has a core that is nowhere near promised and marketed ""nextgen openworld experience"", its just a ""play once - delete - forget it"" game like one of those yearly AC titles.

There is quite a lot of content to explore, in terms of ambiance and media (graphics, music,Cyberpunk 2077 had fallen well in Covid period as a nice illustration of dystopian reality, it is seen in the game, it is seen in the contemporary world; the story part is excellent and the storytelling mastery seen in Witcher 3 can be clearly seen together with excellent acting of voice actors. There is quite a lot of content to explore, in terms of ambiance and media (graphics, music, sounds) the world is rich and varied. Most places are quite unique. It is a way to visit ""Blade runnerish"" city and its different flavours, including Mad Maxish, Fallout like vibes. The disadvantage is that quite many of those places are dead ends, the decorative doors and buildings not accessible to player are numerous, what is somehow a pity for such big gameworld. Another issue is with NPCs: while we can regularly stumble upon those scripted NPCs talking between themselves, I had quite often the feeling that Night City is filled with very rudimentary AI bots in the way I have never experienced in Witcher 3, which seemed much more alive: there are no dialogues with random NPCs and they have very basic routines, giving an artificial feel. As for quests they are linear mostly, and the player's impact on the gameworld is quite insignificant, despite the recurrent theme of ""leaving the mark"" on the Night City, that is exposed in the game lore and story, still the writing of individual quests is very good and worth following despite that linearity, deeply in the cyberpunk vibe.  One can admit: the gameplay is less fluid than the one in GTA V (especially for vehicles part, the races for example are laughable) but still, CP2077 is supposed to be rather CRPG game than action adventure, but it succeeds more as a latter. Actually the simulated content is of bad quality, while scripted one has an exceptional quality (and that explains my score for that game). The character development schema is in state of art, together with skills evolution enforced by player's play style (skills increase levels when they are often used) and quite a lot of customization that can be done on weapons and clothes and such (craft system), yet the random loot somehow renders all that irrelevant, since just playing forward and leveling we gradually get better and better gear without much need for any crafting. The fighting ingame with different enemies is fun enough.  Last but not least: the bugs - they are everywhere and they diminish the pleasure of gameplay while being immerged in the gameworld, still they get fixed gradually (though still a shame that unfinished game has been rushed out on market to ""increase shareholders value"").  I suppose that ""undercooked"" parts, such as police system, the unscripted part of empty gameworld will not improve much in future (except for modders work maybe, that seems to be supported by CDP RED ?), still for scripted storytelling alone the game is worth to be played and enjoyed.  All in all: it is a ""must play"" for all cyberpunk ambiance fans that liked ""Blade Runner"" movie or ""Observer"" game, even if the game has weaker parts, especially those similar to GTA V gameplay; together with other polish game in similar setting, ""The Observer"", that game is worthy SF content.… Expand "

Great expectations and excitement before the game's release, and now a few months after the game is still unplayable even on powerful computer. Time wasted trying to fix the game and finding ways to make the game just work should be spent playing something else. A total disappointment for the CD project Red "

Forget it. It does not worth 60 EUR. CDPR was one of the trusted game developers for me - I will never pre-order or buy their games at full price.  Now, after 150 hours of play (and I am only at the beginning of Act 2) I can say that if you strip the game of the fancy looks etc, it is just a basic unoptimized, totally unbalanced, pretty looter-shooter at this stage. One might ask why would I complain if I sank 150 hours into this, and why would it not worth the full price? Answer is simple: I sank 500 hours plus into e.g. tetris, still it wasn't 60 USD. I mean I can happily waste my time on youtube/facebook etc for hours, so playtime is not a good argument for the price of the game, sorry.  The bottom line is that CDPR should have waited for an other year at least to release this, but they were greedy, so shame on them big time !! They also shouldn't have created such high expectations with over promising on features. It is good that they were ambitious, but should have done reality checks waaaay more often, and sync with / slap their PR/marketing folks.  The signs are everywhere: some elements of the game are brilliant, and finished, like car interiors, most details in the buildings of Night City.  Most are half-baked, like the combat mechanics (all combat, but brawling is the worst), weapon usage and stats, merchants and stores (very simple), hacking, even the character creation at the start.. It is not an RPG, no consequences, no intricate changes to the story based on character decisions, nothing.  Some are downright a disgrace: the economy and trading in the game, including ripperdocs, the crafting system, police AI and AI in general for that matter. Many praise the graphics, but if you look in the details, there are issues there too: just check the shadow of your player character: shoulders are detached (wtf?), cars in the distance are a joke (just jpgs moving on a canvas), and were put there in the last moment to save on computer resources apparently. Don't get me started on the bugs which are totally immersion breaking - and there are a lot, I mean a lot.. trees are glitching, characters / cars respawn from mid-air and break/blow up (wtf?), V dies while walking, characters/weapons are sunk into the ground frequently, many times you cannot even pick them up, and the list just goes on and on..… Expand "

A few visual ones here ant there, maybe quest not triggered for me twice and i had to reload save, that's all. Nothing really game or immersion breaking like people say. To put it into a context Fallout 4 at  launch was much worse for me. And i am not speaking about just visual bugs but game crashesh and performance related stuff that actually stopped me from playing. But i guess if Bethesda or any other well known developer releases bugged game it's ok, because we expect that. Why expect excelence from RED and let other slip ? That is just not fair. Especially considering fact that Cyberpunk is brand new IP, not yet another part of brand well established. We all know those games that are being released each year and we are so used to them that we are not even surpised if there any bugs or gamne mechanics that wasn't fixed for years. What is important is that bugs will be fixed and what we are left with is probably the most impresive open world game i have ever seen. I am not speaking Red Dead Redemption grass fields and forest impressive. I am speaking city so dense, so complex, so rich in detail that it could be  used in next 10 CODs or split into a few Assassins. Night City designs is just mind boggling. Streetsm buildings, highways, alleys, levels on top of levels and all that covered by shades of enormous skyscrapers towering over the city. And none on them looking copy paste. Each alley could be a seperate level in any given AAA shooter. Atention to details is just insane. All that is served in most beautifull lighting system i have ever seen. Just the visual aspect of Cyberpunk deserves high score. But we are also getting really solid action RPG. With good storyline, well acted characters and great dialogues. Animations is what really sells them. There is enough stat/skill/inventory menagment to satisfy any RPG fan. Crafting, upgreading items,  weapon mods, implants, all there. And the part i feared the most, shooting. It is really fun, good shooter fun actually. I am surprised how well CDPred pulled that of knowing that they have zero experience with shooters. To crown it all, great music and sound, really setting the mood. If you are Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Bladerunner fan this game is must have for you. Its is like  those worlds brought to life. This is easily on of the best open world game ever made and solid very action rpg. Any ""reviews"" saying otherewise are either written by people who never played it or other games or just pure hatred. In my opinion it deserves solid 9. But i amd giving it a 10 because how the world design and scale impacted me and to counterbalance all those hate zero scores that are just rubbish.… Expand "

I am playing this game on one of the most powerful gaming computers available yet the game still constantly bugs out.  The graphics are breathtaking and the story is equally so, but the bugs and glitches are so constant and so miserable that it completely breaks the immersion.  One glitch causes the game to stutter so violently that I invariably have to shut the game down and restart it every 15 minutes.  Another glitch displays my character asserting the infamous dominant T-pose, also every 15 minutes.  Yet another glitch causes bags of trash around me to spontaneously explode, (hilarious at first, but miserable the 50th time).  The glitches listed above are just a small sampling of the shockingly awful situation on full display in this game.  Mind you, this is on a $3,000 custom built gaming rig.  It gets even worse if you are playing PS4 or Xbox.  Don’t expect a AAA experience from this supposedly AAA game, because you won’t get one for this and other reasons.  As far as gameplay, the story is fun and so are the characters.  Or at least it would be, if the developers didn’t deliberately pack as much smut into it as they possibly could so they can jam it right down your throat at every possible moment.  For example, there are salacious billboard adds that automatically play pretty much everywhere you go in the game.  One has a woman moaning so loudly and so obnoxiously that I can’t take shooting bad guys even the least bit seriously.  On a more ugly note, an entire mission is devoted to literally nailing a guy to a cross to crucify him as a public spectacle.  There are more “WTF” inducing moments in this game, but that should give you some idea of what to expect.  After an initial 5-10 hours of excellent storyline, everything begins to feel hollow and pointless, struggling to even care.  CD Project Red, what in the hell were you thinking?  You had almost 10 whole years of development and  a golden opportunity here, and you blew it.  Nobody wants to be bombarded with smut for a whole 40 hours of story-driven narrative and nobody wants to be your personal beta-testing guinea pigs so that you can lazily iron out all the bugs after you release the whole game to the public.  I give this game a miserable and sadly well deserved 6/10.  It could have been so much more.  Buy this game only when it goes on a major discount or raise your pirate flag on this one.… Expand "

4xGamer,"Nov 27, 2021",9," I've played this game on PC for about 30 hours now and it is very stable. I have a good PC with a 1080 video card running this game at Ultra settings and I've had no crashes and no problems. There are a few minor game bugs, mainly where you occasionally can't pick up a piece of junk material off the ground, but that doesn't affect the game and doesn't bother me. The game has only been outI've played this game on PC for about 30 hours now and it is very stable.

There are a few minor game bugs, mainly where you occasionally can't pick up a piece of junk material off the ground, but that doesn't affect the game and doesn't bother me. The game has only been out a few days now so I'm sure CDPR will get around to minor patches for the PC sometime later.  The visuals in this game are really fantastic. The city itself is stunning, the amount of unique npc's walking around the city, the individual pieces of graffiti on the walls, the unique TV ads that come over the monitors throughout the city... absolutely amazing. You can tell a LOT of work went into this game. Even the car traffic on the streets is great. Cars will honk at you if you stop at a green light or drive on the wrong side of the road, the traffic acts as close to real traffic as I've ever seen. Some people might not appreciate that, but it's that kind of layering that really adds to the feel of a game. You can fast travel in this game, but I often drive my car from point to point just because it's just so amazing to look at how amazing the city is that CDPR built in this game.  The game play and missions are really good, the number of side missions are massive and fun to play. I've probably spent 2/3 of my time up until now just running side missions. I can see people ripping on the game here because they expected more from the game due to the marketing, but if you don't over-hype the game in your head then you'll probably appreciate this game, in my opinion I would say it's still the best of 2020 despite the over-hype that the company did and the problems it has had on some console devices. Definitely recommend it for a good PC system though.  I heard there were bugs on the PS4 (it's December right now), so if you have a PS4 just wait until February when they plan on fixing the issues. But if you have a good PC with a good graphics card then I highly recommend this game. For game play it's similar to Deus Ex, but far, far better in its execution, graphics and it doesn't have all that in-game purchase stuff that I hated in Deus Ex.  There's just so much to do in this game. I highly recommend it, but don't over-hype the game in your head, it's still just a video game but it's better than most and still has video game limitations. Probably hold off until February 2021 if you plan to play on an old console like PS4, but I definitely recommend it for PC right now.… Expand "

I have never been so attached to such a extreme to any characters or story in a video game until Cyberpunk.  I was originally gonna rate this game a solid 9 due to all the minor bugs but after those credits rolled I felt so emotionally attached and impacted that it would have been unfair to rate it anything less than a 10. Once CDPR fixes a lot of the performance issue people seem to be having and bugs this game will hands down be the game of the decade.  I managed to do a spoiler free playthrough and I payed little attention to any media coverage of it after the release which is why I was so surprised by the negative review this game is getting.  After reading some of the negative reviews it is apparent most of them never participated in side content or got to experience the amazing endings of the game. Also, many reviews seem to be posted right after the game launch which would mean they never even got far into the game let alone completed it. Most of the legit criticism seems to be about the bugs and performance issues which from what I have seen is an issue on older gen consoles the most. As we have seen with CDPR's handling with the Witcher 3 and its own super buggy start I am confident CDPR will address most if not all of the issues with Cyberpunk.  I am happy to see the user review score is increasing rapidly and I know that is because people are actually starting to finish the game and have experienced what I have experienced. All I must say is this is a game that you need to complete to fully understand and appreciate. Trust me when I say it is 100% worth it.… Expand "

I was expecting it from afar, knowing more or less what to expect. ______  This game was a real slap in the face for me. From start to finish, the game makes us experience a lot of emotions. Going from joy to sadness, from serenity to stress, from confidence to doubt, the game will make us react and feel a whole lot of emotions.  We will also have to think about our choices, and this throughout the adventure because yes, in this game, our choices can (each on their own scale) change the course of the game. Certain choices during the side quests can also have a affect the end (s) of the game.  The writing quality is just perfect. As well for the main quests as secondary, the whole is coherent and fits perfectly with the lore and with this ""beautiful city"" that is Night City.  Speaking of the city, is it truly extraordinary. It is teeming with life and things to see. The game map will give you a feeling of enormous freedom at times, and will crush and compress you at other times. The playing area is extremely cohesive and breathes life. Its dark side may also hide some surprises from you.  On the gameplay side, I found the game as a whole very enjoyable to play. The fps view really adds a plus to the immersion, especially in the cutscenes. The few sequences of unarmed combat are slightly more messy, but largely playable as well. Driving a vehicle is good without being extraordinary, it is nevertheless extremely pleasant to explore the surroundings of Night City on a motorbike, for example, in order to discover the landscapes and the magnificent points of view that CDPR has offered us in this title.  As for the RPG and customization side, I found everything to be very complete and malleable. Sometimes it lacks tutorials for some things, but overall everything handles pretty easily. It is really possible to create, equip and specialize your character as you want, which allows for a lot of different gameplay styles.  As for the optimization of the game, I had no major worries about my configuration (3080 / 3600x / 16gb / 1440p), even if keeping 60 fps stable in the city center is not easy, even with a 3080. The ray tracing is however extremely greedy, so personally I deactivated it, and the game is still magnificent.  In terms of graphics, the game is simply superb. The animations are consistent, and the facial animation adapted in real time is really a plus for the immersion. Some sets are simply beautiful, both outdoors and indoors.  Regarding bugs, yes I had a few. But no bug really blocked me in my progress. Most of the bugs are graphical, like animation bugs. I did not really have any blocking or annoying concerns throughout my adventure.  So there you have it, in summary, I really loved walking around Night City, and I already miss this little world. I can't wait to get my hands on future DLCs so I can dive back into this extraordinary world. I really recommend it to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in a huge and cohesive world.… Expand "

The world of Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best ever created, in combination with the marvelous story and the exceptional side quests (gigs = short get this, klii that one; side quests = real side quests with unique storys; question marks = can be anything; and many, many open world activities you can do quickly on the run). The charakter building is almost perfect and really functions.  I feel most of the negative ""critics"" are people who wanted something to turn their real life around. CPR never said that they will release a GTA-RDR-Skyrim clone - no, they made their own version of a dystopian future RPG shooter. And in that field they delivered a 100%.  If you're into the Witcher and have even a tiny bit of imagination (many of the lore is in text, small details, item descriptions etc.) BUY this game.

But i guess the most important aspect is that you wont get a´nother generic open world sandbox but a story driven rpg. no you can't just blow up cars and see what happens next. This is not what the game is designed for. It was made to present you a wonderful city and an meanigful story with great story telling and superior writing (compared to similar games).

But bugs can be fixed, and definitely will be as Reds showed in Witcher (that was buggy as well on start).  The bigger problem is with AI - yes, police is for now a big problem. For me they could as well not exist and need huge repair, same with car traffic and pedestrians.  But for me this game isn't about running around and doing 'nothing' like GTA, it's not 5th game of this same game where you just improve things that you have included, it's something new for Reds... and the plot (not only main line but sidequests as well) is just great. Graphic probably is great too (I still wait for my new graphic card to switch to higher settings but even now it's really good). And music... damn, I'm still iistening to it.

Definitely yes, for me it's one of best game experiences in years and I had this luck or smth not to be hit by many bugs (and as I prefer to run and sightseeing without attacking random people so police didn't hunt me... well I had really good experience even now).  Definitely not deserve 0/10 so I give 10/10 to align score... for now I would give it 9/10 anyway but won't downgrade score because of bugs that can be reapired.

The AI characters in the city are modeled just right, IMHO - they couldn't care less about you and will brush you off if you try to talk, which is very much like real world city experiences are ;)  The graphics are absolutely phenomenal. Character rendering like we used to only see in Dead or Alive, detailled and lifelike. The city scape matches this in quality, with different districts having their own character and no copy/paste look. I keep just staring at things.  The story is really rich and fascinating. I won't go into spoilery details, but arguably this is the most interesting aspect of the game - I could see writing large scale DLCs for the engine being a great way to continue the franchise.  There are some bugs I've encountered, but all of them had easy fixes. Nowhere near what the level of complaints from older consoles seems to indicate.  I am not the greatest fan of the soundtrack, but arguably that's the least important aspect of the game.  Overall, I am having fun and am playing more compulsively than I probably should. Just know that the platform you're playing on might negatively impact your experience. Personally, this is the first time I've found the Stadia experience to be a major upside.  The critical reception IMHO is flawed - I've played every large single player RPG on Xbox, PC and Playstation for the last decade, and this one is breaking new ground and compares favorably to all of them.… Expand "

Such are the times we live in.  * Transphobia: They could have allowed players to simply choose their gender, not determine it by voice. An oversight, but they do allow choice in genitals/gender. The game does objectify trans characters & exaggerate sexual presentation ...& everyone else: a trans character on a poster might have bulging biceps & a heavy crotch. Heteronormative characters are similarly exploited. That is the point of satire, and especially in this capitalist, violent, sexualized, & technophilic dystopia. You decide, do you want a sterilized environment that pretends that humanity will not use capitalism, sexuality, fear, & bias to its advantage?  * Asian **** In our world today, technological improvements do frequently come from Japan, China, South Korea, Vietnam - & all these have their own approaches to it: in production, in art and aesthetic, in advances. Cyberpunk supposes that this expands, and it does pre-suppose that Japan leads in that innovation. Whether we agree that is realistic or not is beside the point. Cyberpunk is a fiction. The answer, then, is to bring in the multiplicity of languages, diversify the representation & depiction, make them visible. That. Is. Exactly. What. CDProjekt. Has. Done.  Art/Visuals: stunning. The same quality as Witcher 3, though the aesthetic is very different. I don't find myself gaping in awe at the beauty as much, but then I don't really do that with any other AAA game, and it is a dystopian world. The eye flits from thing to person to light, wondering at the activity, engaging in the city life around me. My $1000 PC, a year old, handles it all pretty well, without many hiccups, on Medium Ray Tracing. The clothing looks wet too often though, & a little plasticky.  9.0/10  Gameplay: It's taken some getting used to because of the variety. Hacking, shooting, fighting, melee with shooting weapons, targeting, cyberware action hacking (different than regular terminal hacking), sneaking, roleplaying choices, racing, recon, throwables, explosive environments, police responses, random encounters and jobs, stores - goodness. Lions & tigers & bears oh my. I find myself having fun in one way, then another, then another, then coming back to the story - taking my time getting to know both Night City & my character. 9/10  Character Creation/Development: This part is quite a joy. I enjoy the two-part leveling system of Street Cred & Levels. The levels work much the same as they did in Witcher 3, opening up item use. Street Cred does a similar thing, as do stats; skill choices require stats at certain levels. In the end, it drives you to think very carefully about your choices, & the game style you want, but it doesn't punish you for not being a robot of efficiency. I play on Hard & I've shifted the focus of my stats more than once. The physical character creation is detailed & flexible, allowing male, female, & trans characters; like BG3. One thing that is worth mentioning is that your choices in stats have many opportunities to matter. This *includes* dialogue. Really, where are all the people that trash first person shooters for useless stealth mode or forced stealth mode? No? Silence? 9.5/10  Story: It doesn't evoke the same emotional response as Witcher 3, even Witcher 2, Vampire: Bloodlines, and other great great titles. We'll see. I do appreciate certain characters. Perhaps if people spent a little less time presenting their cool side, or their BFG and their BA threads, and more their human side, I'd be pulled in. But, that's the world we live in, eh? Still, the human disassociation takes its toll on the storyline. I think there's room to do both. Otherwise, story progresses well. Not too predictably, lots of options, lots of wit, lots of character. 8.7/10  World: The world comes to life beautifully. Characters speak in multiple languages with correct inflection. I'm not used to seeing such attention to culture & language except for certain AC games. Architecture varies across districts. Atmosphere changes across the day & its changing lighting, in various rooms, down varied alleyways. The size is quite large - on the level of GTA5 or so. It truly feels like a city - not a few blocks to provide the impression of a city. One hears snatches of arguments, lovers' spats, notes a couple staring at the sunset on a construction zone overlooking the city, radio personalities reminiscent of V: Bloodlines & Deb of the Night (OK, nobody is as good as Deb). Sound scapes, visual scapes - they come together beautifully. They give you useful information, flavor, opportunities to engage - all of it. 9.7/10  Total: 9.3/10 (possibly 9.0 - 9.5; I am, after all, only on Act I)  Here's to more of this kind of video gaming. Let's not destroy the things we love most because they don't meet our ideal.… Expand "

My worst problem was that I was getting a lot of crashing, but after troubleshooting that turned out to be either because of my GPU or the overclock I had on the GPU. (I ended up replacing the card and borrowing it to a friend, i haven't had a crash in 30 hours, he was crashing as we were setting the card up in his system until I removed the OC and left it stock)  Despite the issues the game has, I am having a ton of fun with it. The gameplay is fun, I love how relatively real the characters in the game feel (especially how they randomly call and text you), I like the loot/craft/upgrade systems in the game, I enjoy the monkeying with the fashion of my character despite the game mostly being in 3rd person, great customization as far as character builds, the story isn't AMAZING but it is engaging and a lot of the side-quests and Gigs are really good, the game looks gorgeous (playing on an RX 6800 with mostly maxed settings, a few things that don't make a visual impact but do make a performance impact turned down), the world feels dense and alive...  I just really enjoy this game, despite the flaws, and if the glitches and bugs are ironed out I would give it a 9/10.  Some things that I would improve on... I like the 1st person view in a lot of the cars, but many have so much crap sticking out of the hood it's hard to see. Vehicle/clothes/gear customization. Being able to change V's appearance in game, even if just by a haircut. Improve traffic AI. Probably some others I'm not thinking of now, I don't think any game is a perfect 10/10, despite how often review sites throw that score around, glossing over issues with games or even dropping scores for things that has nothing to do with the game itself (like politics, racism issues or gender equality/freedom).  Update: Currently at 117 hours in, finding tons of stuff I missed in previous playthroughs, being impressed with the detail the game has and how certain choices can make you completely miss things in the game or cause some events to never happen. I still haven't been really affected too much by bugs and glitches beyond some minor annoyance. Definitely a solid 8/10 game that for me is now creeping towards a 9/10 even with the bugs and glitches just because of everything I've found in more playing time that I'd missed or not noticed before.… Expand "

I am impressed with all the hard work developers put into this. They definitely messed up with releasing an unfinished Ps4 and Xbox One edition and deserve the criticism they are getting for releasing those versions in a poor state, but on Stadia this game is a charm. I love Night City, got most of the cars, done a lot of side missions and the relations you can build with characters like Panam or Lucy are great. I should give it a 10 because of so many people giving it a zero without even playing it, but wont give it a fake score. It has some problems but nothing major on Stadia, and should be fixed by DLC and patches in the future. It has been a fun 70+ hours and counting. Would live in Night City over GTA Online and Red Dead Online if it adds a multiplayer online world in the future. It would be nice to get a new apartment. Great work on this game, but you should have waited to patch the problems or release it with people knowing is on early access to avoid this PR mess. Reminds me of No Man Sky. I love that game too, and how Hello Games has added more and more amazing features since release. Two very ambitious projects that simply needed more time and released a bit too early. Can easily see this becoming the next most improved game. I feel a lot of the criticism comes from people that don't appreciate how hard it is to build something this extensive.

The shooter gameplay is quite good, I've seen some people compare the game to the GTA series, but to be honest I like the gameplay of this game better. The RPG aspect is good but not great, you have many ways of customising your character but I find the perk system a bit bare, the cyberware customisations are amazing though so tit for tat. The crafting system is quite good in my opinion, simple but effective, gear drops are also quite good, you'll be getting upgrades constantly and if you find a piece of gear you enjoy you can upgrade it to keep using it, though I would advice checking the upgrade costs because they actually get quite steep after a few upgrades.  Now to address the elephant in the room it does not reach up to the hype that was built around it, but let's be honest nothing could. What happened for this game has happened a thousand times and I'm sure it will happen again, people get hyped out of their minds and then when the product inevitably fails to meet those expectations they don't like it, which is fair, I just don't think it's very productive for the games industry as a whole.  In general I don't regret my purchase I got 40+ hours of gameplay which for the price is very good value, once CDPR has polished the game more (which I'm 100%  sure they will), I'll have another go at it at max difficulty to 100% it and see the game as it was supposed to be done.… Expand "

Bugs like picking up items of the ground doesn't always work, in the main mission a car was flipped a few times, but it works when you reload it. Stealth mechanics feel basic, shooting feels rewarding when you hit it with the controller, and melee combat is clunky but functional and actually my preferred way of playing on the controller. The movement mechanics feel clunky, and there isn't as much flow as if you played a CS GO game but its understandable. The game really focuses on RPG elements, visuals and music. As with the bugs, I am sure that CD Project Red will iron them out completely in 3-4 months time, and maybe rebuild some game mechanics.

Yesterday I went for a ride with a bike on the highway. The experience was amazing. Good radio music, chill ride.  Gun play is good, guns have a very good feeling to them. You can modify them too, but the choice is not too big.  The enemy AI is somewhat good, yeah when you point a gun at someone on the steet, they all react the same way, but I hope this will change, for now though I dont even care about this. I dont usually point guns at people's faces.  Cops spawn everywhere? Who cares? I avoid messing up the AI anyway. Ofcourse you are going to find a bug here and there if you mess with the AI....  Its true there are some visual glitches, but with a massive game like that this was unavoidable. I am sure they will get patched.  People expected too much of the game, because of the hype, so this is what happened here. I actually kept my excitement to a minimum and I am pleasantly surprised with the game.  OH AND BTW THE MIRROR IS ACTUALLY AMAZING! My V is a super hot chick, its a pleasure to look at her in the mirror.… Expand "

HattheVulture,"Dec 15, 2020",6," I came to Cyberpunk with a degree of suspicion.  There was a huge amount of hype and a lot of promises that made me suspicious that we might be building ourselves up for another No Man's Sky... and I'm pretty certain that is where we have ended up.  Massive expectations and a mediocre game.  If you want the TL/DR, there is a good game in there under the bugs and other crap.  I've enjoyedI came to Cyberpunk with a degree of suspicion.

Massive expectations and a mediocre game.  If you want the TL/DR, there is a good game in there under the bugs and other crap.  I've enjoyed it well enough and will probably finish the game, but won't be coming back.  For something that sets out to be immersive, Cyberpunk falls pretty damned short.  Maybe get it when it comes on sale.  Before I start it is worth pointing out that I'm coming at this game with a high-end PC so haven't experienced any of the performance issues that an awful lot of people have been having.  The Good Bits * The story:  It is entertaining and the characters are well written.  Some people might disagree on that, these things are quite subjective, but I have, for the most part, quite enjoyed that aspect of the game. *The immersive aspects the story: Sitting down and drinking while talking to people is a nice touch and they do take time in the conversations to flesh out the characters.  The Bad Bits * The Bugs: Holy mackerel Batman, are there a lot of these!  Random T-posing NPCs/corpses, suddenly teleporting across the screen, turning bald when you look in the mirror, unlootable robot bodies, your health bar suddenly showing zero HP and never going up or down... Traffic/ NPC Spawning: Driving down the road and having a truck spawn 5 feet in front of your vehicle is pretty damned aggravating. * Vehicles: Driving is painful.  I only just realised there was a handbrake.  It doesn't appear to do anything. * Character choices: There are only one or two main missions where you can do anything that make an iota of difference to what happens in the world.  The Bits that Could have been so much more... * The Graphics:  Don't get me wrong, the ray tracing is very pretty, but the reflective surfaces don't reflect you or a large proportion on NPCs (I'm assuming because they pop out of existence when you turn away from them) and that really breaks immersion once you realise that you are a vampire.  Interestingly a modder has discovered there is a line in one of the files that you can change from 'False' to 'True' to allow your reflection to show.  Why is it off by default?  Because your character doesn't actually have a head model most of the time.  Once you realise this you can also see this in shadows - V's head looks like the reflection of a volley ball. * Character Customisation:  What is the point?  You literally only see V when you are driving a car/motorbike, on the menu screens or when you are looking into the bathroom mirror (you walk up to them and activate them and then it shows your face... as a bald person if you happen to have a hat/glasses on).  You also can't change V's appearance after creation.  Not that it matters that much. * Equipment Upgrades: In theory you can keep a piece of equipment you love and keep upgrading it as you level... but the cost goes up each time you do that to the point where it becomes impossible.  So generally it's better to just forget about it altogether and use the best crap in your inventory.  Yes, V will look like a clown, but it's not like you see V anyway. * The perks and body mods:  Kinda feel like something that was tacked on and isn't that necessary.  You could complete the game without bothering. * Non-lethal attacks:  Is there any point to not straight up killing people apart from the very small number of missions where they say you should aim to take a boss down without killing them?  There's a non-lethal takedown you can use on mooks in stealth mode, but I've yet to ever see a reason why you'd use that instead of killing someone.… Expand "

The formula is vastly different to what was promised or heavily implied through the carefuly crafted teasers, trailers and interviews. All the features that made it to the game are very shallow.  For a long time the game was presented as an actual RPG. This is not an RPG game. It's an action-adventure game with some RPG combat mechanics. You get to pick perks, put attribute points, loot items and craft gear. But that's it when it comes to ""RPG"". There is no ""RPG"" in terms of defining your character, who you are, no options to roleplay through the dialogue options (in general conversations are very limited). The life paths are a joke, clearly cut out from the game to simplify it.  I was expecting a game where I can enter a club or random shop and talk with some NPCs just for the sake of... talking. No, nothing like that, the conversations are only there to push forward the story. No conversations like the ones in The Outer Worlds, Mass Effect, Dragon Age or even Fallout games.  There's also a big disparity between following the main story and doing side activities. In the main story game is very cinematic and the story is quite good, serious. But once you start doing side ""quests"", it becomes a different game. Very shallow looter shooter with tons of random battles. Run in, kill enemies, loot tons of weapons and gear, move to the next point on the map. Similar to FarCry games.  It's not an RPG, it's just a looter shooter with very basic RPG MECHANICS in terms of combat. The city feels dead, everything that was supposed to be interesting and exciting was cut out from game. This game is simply easy to forget. Very disappointing.  FarCry 2077. I give it 5/10 rating. VERY average and forgetable game, and that is despite the technical issues.… Expand "

CDPR has intentionally lied about not only the technical performance of this game, ,but I would even argue the entire game itself is one big lie. Their are three life paths and all three lead you to the same ending. Before someone tells me that's not true, yes I do know side quests will alter some of the main story, however, its still not what was promised and I have to  go outside of the main story to change V's progrssion? And even at that its still very shallow. Most quests only change either minor things about the story or have cosmetic changes only. The AI are god awful and yes this falls under glitches/ bugs, but when the game is an open world RPG (In name alone not in implementation) it gets hard to ignore how lifeless the AI are. Games like GTA 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, and The Witcher 3 all have better AI than 2077. 2077 is a lifeless city. So much of the game has either been taken out, or is just sub par. You can't customize your apartment, the whole game is censored, lack luster customization compared to what was shown in 2018, lack luster shops, no transit system ( you can find where the sub way station should be in the game, but they never designed it past that), can't get haircuts, can't eat food, no wall running, failed police AI once again the police do not behave as promised, and I could go on, and on about this game. And even excusing all of the failed promises the game is just very bare bones. Why can't you do anything in this game besides missions that are all the same? Where are all the epic gang and corporate wars? Why do police not patrol the city? The game just is missing so many elements from previous RPGs. This part of my review is complete speculation as I don't have many facts to back it up, however, I speculate that 2077 the game never truly existed. All of the past footage was made up as a fake... much like Anthem was. I think they have only truly been working on this game for a few years and not the 8 years that was claimed. This game needs another two years in development to fix all the bugs, broken promises, and now our broken relationship with CDPR. Gaming officially has no good, trustworthy companies only money hungry corporations.  Excuse my grammar in this review rant, but I figure if 2077 can be a little buggy then why can't my writing be for this review. I give 2077 a 5/10 one of the worst RPGs I've played ever, glitches or no glitches… Expand "
MiddleAgedGamer,"Dec 15, 2020",8," Purchased Cyberpunk 2077 just before Christmas 2020, so it had been out for a couple of weeks and there was plenty of news about how it was full of bugs and glitches etc. With these in mind, and having watched a number of Twitch streams playing through the early part of the game, I decided to pick the game up and try it myself, on a mid spec PC not running the latest and greatest GPU.Purchased Cyberpunk 2077 just before Christmas 2020, so it had been out for a couple of weeks and there was plenty of news about how it was full of bugs and glitches etc. With these in mind, and having watched a number of Twitch streams playing through the early part of the game, I decided to pick the game up and try it myself, on a mid spec PC not running the latest and greatest GPU.  Maybe because I wasn't bought into the hype machine that whipped everybody's expectations up, and hadn't followed the games development for years, I went in with little knowledge of what the game was supposed to deliver, all I knew was the setting for the game and the basic RPG concept, and what bits I'd learned from watching streams of the game.  My initial impressions once installed were good - the general theme of the menu's etc all fit with the games image, and is easy enough to navigate through. The game itself runs well on my mid-spec GTX1660ti GPU & i5 processor with the graphics set to medium/high and maximum traffic density. I get around 4-50fps with no stutters and lag.  Story and side missions are enjoyable, and its easy to get distracted driving round the city to take in some of the sights and sounds. Playing on a medium difficulty level, it took me about 35 hours to run through the main story ignoring side missions, and I'm at about 80 hours in now and currently working through those other gigs that appear in the game.  Have there been issues with the game - yes. In my experience the AI is lacking, with NPC's often just doing default actions like cowering when there is gun fire, and the police unable to chase you further than a block before you easily escape. Cars and traffic in general is rigid in its pattern, often easily blocked by parking your car in the road. Cars will also just run you over if you walk in front of them rather than stopping. Vehicles will also clip solid walls and buildings, as if their pre-determined route isn't quite mapped to the rendered world.  I've had three game stopping bugs happen through different missions, where a prompt for a key press doesn't appear, or a character just isn't present. YouTube tutorials has provided workarounds (expect these to be patched at some point) if you are stuck. I've not had any game crashes to desktop though.  Interface wise there are some elements that annoy - backpack inventory where you hover over items then gets a pop-over dialog which hides the items, it seems a better option would be to have the pop-over dialog fixed to one side and the items on the other. Sometimes pressing the map button opens the inventory, sometimes options disappear once you've sold or dismantled a few items, meaning you have to close and open the menu again.  The game itself expects you to develop an understanding of how things work without really explaining them - crafting and upgrades especially require a bit of thinking about before it becomes obvious how they work.  However, even with those negative points, its still a game that has sucked me into its world and I look forward to playing on a daily basis. My biggest concern is finishing it before any DLC is available. I expect there to be another 40-50 hours of gameplay to get through, for a total of around 120 hours. I like to work out a cost per hour of games, and for Cyberpunk2077 this means its roughly 40p per hour. Given that other triple-A titles I've got have seen barely 10 hours of game time, this makes Cyberpunk2077 pretty good value in my eyes.… Expand "

TheObviously CP77 suffered a horrendous launch on all platforms, and that should be admonished in its own right, but this review is happening after the late January 2021 update, and CD Projekt Red has made strides to improve stability, fix bugs, and so on.  Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. On XBox One and PlayStation 4, the game looks like an XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 game. The developer very poorly optimized the game for launch on last generation's consoles, despite those consoles being the current generation for the vast majority of the game's development. On PC, the game looks good with up to date hardware, but not nearly as good as promised in trailers and promotional material. Night City does not feel as alive and detailed as it did in the high production value trailers and gameplay reveals. Draw and rendering distances ranged from average at best (top of the line PC hardware) to comically abysmal at worst (PS4).  Crashing is abundant on PS4 and XB1, and only occasional on PC. On PS4 and XB1, you can pretty much set a two hour timer and wait for the game to crash. This issue was not fixed or improved upon in any of the patches.  Combat on all three platforms feels floaty. On PC, I messed with my sensitivity settings a little, tweaking as I went until I found a sweet spot. On console, I messed with the sensitivity settings a lot, and course corrected a frustrating amount of times until I found a tolerable level of float that I could get used to. Stealth is fine, and probably more polished than the combat, which is unfortunate considering how infrequently it is a viable option. Taking out a base of goons in stealth can take so long, that I got bored more often than not and revealed myself on purpose to start a firefight. Quickhacking is interesting, but not very refined. You'll end up sticking to the same three or four quickhacks for every scenario. It's more gimmick than revolutionary feature. Melee combat is so janky, and overall bad. A lot of hits you thought landed, didn't. Some enemies have unexplainable resistances to melee combat, and it bugs out far more frequently than ranged.  Crafting is so utterly terrible and not worth your investment even for a second. Collecting parts is a nightmarishly tedious task, and you have to commit a lot of skill points to crafting in order to create anything worthwhile. Even if you do make a great weapon, chances are you can find a better one in about 20 minutes while out on side missions. CD Projekt Red kept the same boring tedious mechanics for crafting from their Witcher series, and it did not age well at all.  Driving is a non starter. There are very few cars that feel good to drive, and the physics of the game were not built in tandem with the geography of the map in a way to allow players to drive fast without flying around the streets wildly and launching themselves unexpectedly. Either Night City does not have standard Earth gravity, or the cars of 2077 only weigh 100 pounds. I can think of at least a dozen games off the top of my head that had more comfortable driving mechanics.  Choicemaking and dialogue trees are pretty good. Choices feel like they have a lot of weight, and pay off in interesting ways. The writing of CP77 really saves this game. The plot is interesting, perfectly paced, and tense in all the right places. The romance options feel very dumbed down, and V's choices are horribly and disappointingly few, but the ones included in the game are written pretty well, and can all have satisfying endings.  Keanu Reeves is average to slightly above average throughout most of the game, and downright brilliant in some spots. Overall pretty good performance for someone new to performance capture acting. Was he the perfect casting choice? Yes and no, somehow. You can't go wrong with Keanu, but maybe someone else could have done better.  The music in CP77 is varied, well produced, and high quality overall. If you have an eclectic taste in music, you'll love the CP77 radio.  Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is just okay. The amazing story props up the dated and underwhelming gameplay and crashing issues. Bugs make the game annoying to play, but again, the meticulously detailed and thoughtful plot can keep you quitting to the main menu, and loading back in.  I have finished four playthroughs of this game, on all available platforms, on updated hardware.… Expand "

However, almost none of the promises made in this campaign ended up in the final project. And if they did, they oftentimes are very much stripped of everything that made them interesting in the first place.  An open world game is supposed to be immersive and full of life: that is what makes such a game fun. Night City, the open world which Cyberpunk 2077's main story is set in, looks and feels as if there's still a pandemic going around. You won't find many NPCs wandering around, there is barely any traffic to be found, and almost all buildings are completely closed off to the player. There is a serious lack of activities to be found in Night City, so except for driving around, which is not really a satisfying experience due to the weird physics of this game in the first place, there is not a lot to do.  Sure, Night City does look pretty, but it is a rather cliché take on the cyberpunk aesthetic. That does not mean that it is an ugly game, because it absolutely is not. But it is far from ground-breaking in the visual department. You will see many things you have seen before, both in the sense that you have probably seen the exact same design elements on cyberpunk art before, but also in the sense that a lot of assets are copied and pasted throughout the large world.  The characters in this game are quite interesting in and of themselves and even the story is okay (although very predictable), but they don't truly get to shine in a game that feels as unpolished and rushed as Cyberpunk 2077. In this stage of its life, Cyberpunk 2077 feels like a muddled mess full of confusing and contradicting game mechanics that need to be fleshed out rather seriously, a broken and remarkably lacklustre AI for NPCs and traffic that breaks the immersion of Night City, and many other broken promises.  It is absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable that this game was released in the state it is currently in, regardless of whether it will be improved with updates in the future. We should not tolerate such behaviour from large business under any circumstances.… Expand "

To keep it short the game is amazing, the story is amazing, the characters are amazing, the detail in the story telling is amazing, the voice acting is amazing, graphics are amazing etc I’m sure you get the idea by now. I have just found the game to be amazing.  Was is overhyped, you could say that but what game isn’t really. That being said I’ve not been disappointed at all. A lot of the complaints I’ve seen (outside of bugs) make me think these people haven’t actually played the game.  I would say it’s more linear than the Witcher 3 but then again, I’ve played the Witcher 3 through about 7 times so I know the little differences which decisions can make, so when I play Cyberpunk 2077 again, I may notice more changes. That being said there are decisions which do have an impact (where I have saved and loaded to check), anyone who says different is to be blunt, lying.  Gameplay is good, the skills etc reminds me of System Shock 2 in that each opens different options for missions and routes to take.  Soundtrack is also amazing.  The best part of it all for me however is the story, storytelling the characters. Its presented amazingly well and the voice acting is just perfect. I was worried about it having a only first person perspective but it’s done in such a good way I no longer care that it doesn’t have third person cutscenes.  To sum up if someone tells you the game is bad and not because of the bugs just ignore them, they are full of crap. If someone tells you the game is bad because of the bugs you should listen.

But for cyberpunk with maximum/high settings needs $2000 - $3000 pc [Here should be smiling greedy f* face of jensen huang]. And cyberpunk looks slightly better than GTA 5 in the sense of graphics.

Now to the review  The game has the same issues as any newly released game, many bugs sure, but NONE of them are game-breaking, and I believe they will be patched soon. Now on Optimization, I have a 7yo PC with a 1060, and I can run high at 40 frames when I updated my drivers and placed the game on an SDD, sure not 60, but console players can only pull 30 so the game is indeed optimized to the best of their ability considering the Ridiculously detailed world. This game is very heavy, so forget any decent experience if you are trying to play in a calculator.  Now on gameplay, It is very complicated to get into, it has many different ways on how to do stuff, which can overwhelm people sometimes at the start. The gunplay feels nice although enemy AI could use some improvements, stealth is very hard at the start, but once you level a bit and get some specialized perks is very satisfying, Going Rambo on the enemies feel also good as long as they are the same or lower level, forget higher-level ones, and also careful, going Rambo often has an influence on the story, Driving is very well done, my only complain is that cars are tougher than in GTA and don't smash as easily,  Now on  Story, well I can't complain the story is quite good overall, the only part I would improve a bit is the beginning, it's too rushed at the beginning and very linear, after that it very different and every part, if the story and decisions you make,  even small ones have consequences, hell even what you respond to certain  NPCs(google how to get the best melee weapon in cp2077, you'll see what I'm telling you, hint: Sir John Phallustiff). The voice acting is top-notch, my only complaint is animation bugs here and there on the facial animations(probably because of Jali which is technology in development), without giving any spoilers, the story is something you have to think carefully I noticed after save-scumming to see all different results, not only decisions, actions during gameplay are equally as important, like deciding to go lethal or non-lethal vs a boss character, or sneaking vs guns-blazing, all have consequences and I loved the wide range of results.  Customization, well people were getting an overly inflated idea of the level of customization in the game, there is a lot mind you, but for example, character customization is not exactly that big, guns have some attachments and mods you can put, but it is not COD which is dedicated to guns and guns only, Cyberpunk is a simple system, Crafting is very simple but a very useful tool too, and cars can't be customized sadly, although there's a lot of cars you can have. Remember this is an Action/RPG, not a survival crafting game go play Minecraft if you want variety, although I do agree the Witcher had a better system in this regard.  I would rate the game in its current state from my perspective an 8.5 out of 10, the reason I give it 10 here is to balance the bunch of idiots writing 0 with no substance or just for the trolls… Expand "

Though I am running an rtx 2080 and i7-8700k which is quite a bit more capable than what an average console or pc user has. I think if this game is given time it will improve with everyone’s hate for the bugs and ill optimization. I honestly don’t understand how anyone could play this game without dlss. I use dlss and it improves my frames by nearly three to four times depending on the mode. I know most people don’t have an rtx card and that’s  quite sad because I feel Nvidia could put dlss on gtx if they really wanted t, but I guess I understand they wanna make money and what not.  I can say though that FTC and console users aren’t missing out on the ray tracing features. Though the ray traci does look pretty damn good it drops frames to nearly unplayable and with ray tracing I average 20-30 FPS with dlss on ultra performance I’ve tried turning dlss off before to see what it would run and it was 3 dps. Though if you do have something that is able to run this game reasonably well  the game is very good. The though detail and narrative are incredible imo, I’ve never gotten this hooked on a offline open world game like this. I love the setting, the soundtrack is incredible. The characters are very well developed. And Keanu reeves is there for a lot of the time. I feel if you give this game some time it will probably pull a no mans sky and better it’s optimization and bugs. After all it most likely would have delayed more if so many fanboys were going complete ape **** about this game and how it was going to change their lives and shut. At the end of the day it’s just a game, but I think it’s a really good one and is definitely worth playing and if you have something nice enough to run it the game truly does look amazing.

If you are on last gen console (PS4 or Xbox One) then this game is literally unplayable. Frame rates would drop to as low at 14-15 fps, these mfs couldn't even give us 30 fps. If you are on a high end pc then maybe you can get 40-50 fps, but the issues i mentioned above are still there. And honestly I could probably forgive most of this because it can be patched, but what I can't forgive is how boring this game is. The class you choose doesn't matter, very basic shooting mechanics (Destiny 2 did it better), nothing to do outside of a main story and side missions. It's just so boring. That is unforgivable.

Although not perfect, parts of the city seem unfinished with low textures, visual glitches etc..  Story 8/10 Short but fairly enjoyable, Many likeable and interesting characters throughout, Although i never really felt consiquences for my choices likea true RPG...  Gameplay 7/10 Playing on Very hard from the beginning, the game does a terrible job at scaling enemies, no matter how much health or armor i get, i would still get one shot quite frequently, Enemy AI is absolutely terrible in most fights, From downright overpowered to completely oblivious to me standing infront of them. The police AI is completely broken, If you commit a crime they spawn in ontop you lol..  Combat 7/10 I've tried most of the weapon types in the game, Smart weapons are cool but feel like some cheap aimbot, Shotguns just end up getting me one shot because of terrible AI scaling on very hard.. Melee and blunt weapons much the same issues as shotgun, Mantis blade is fun at first, but feels extremely janky. My build ended up with just using a silenced revolver, it one shots most enemies taking any series challenge from the game..Better me one shotting than them! xD  Bugs 10/10 Lots of them haha, glitched flying cars, Hovering while running, instant deaths, Police AI, Broken weapon scaling, characters talking over eachother..... i experiended tons of bugs many immersion breaking and frustrating..  Conclusion, 8/10 I believe the devs will patch this game over the next few months, DLC is innevitable so its in their best interest to get the game fixed with patches...

The world looks stunning, the setting is immersive and the main story is amazing compared to what you see in other games nowadays, but don't make the mistake to stop there. Some of the investigative side quests are as good or even better than the main story. They take hours to complete and give the game a whole different, more quiet spin, compared to the action-packed main storyline. I'm definitely looking forward to more of those.  They put a lot of work into the characters and it shows in the animations, dialogue and voice acting. It's these interactions that bring the world to life. There are many characters in Cyberpunk that would lend themselves for a spin off or DLC.  I liked that the main story isn't too long (about 20-30 hours I guess). If you want more, there's the mentioned side quest lines, gigs that have you steal something or help someone, some collection quests and typical open world stuff - mostly beating up gangs.  ---  There are some minor bugs that are to be expected and will be fixed without a doubt, but during 100 hours of playing I haven't had any bug that wasn't fixed by saving and reloading.  The biggest issue for me is the pop in of NPCs and cars. They disappear as soon as they're out of sight, so if you pass someone and then turn around, you'll see a different NPC than the one you passed. You won't really notice this if you just go from A to B to do quests, but once you know about it, it's difficult to ignore. When you do something illegal, police are teleported right next to you and that's where it really breaks the immersion a bit. The same goes for races, where your opponents are continuously teleported around you, no matter what happens. The car races in this beautiful world should be a highlight, but like this they're just underwhelming.  Similarly, NPCs have almost no artificial intelligence to speak of. They have a very limited set of things they react to. I'm guessing that this is a direct result of how the NPC spawning works, because it's difficult for objects to interact with each other if they just instantly pop in and out of the world.  These choices were most likely done for performance reasons and it's the one major thing that the game could do better. If you are looking to interact with the open world a lot, cause trouble and get into police chases, this game is simply not for you. They will have to fix this if they are looking to make an online mode, but the way I play, it hasn't prevented me from enjoying the game.  ===  In the end, Cyberpunk is easily among the best I've played. It's like Deus Ex, but with a much bigger, open world and a more complex skill and item system, if you want to compare it to other games.  It's heavily story-driven and the world just serves as a big stage for the quests. You won't find a lot of interaction outside of those quests, so again, to draw a comparison, Cyberpunk is not GTA in a sci-fi setting.  I haven't watched many trailers up front, so I'm not one of those who are disappointed that this and that didn't make it into the game. Instead, I can fully enjoy it for the great game it is. 10/10 and my game of the year.… Expand "

The enemy AI is borderline free mobile gaming tier garbage.  The gunplay can be satisfying at times but that is like 10% of the combat. The enemies are just bullet sponges that do millions of damage (on hard difficulty) and the enemy variety is trash. But its an RPG game so ill let it slide.  Driving feels wonky, it feels like Spintires except im not in a 3 ton truck going though 6 feet deep mud instead im a racecar on asphalt. It feels weird, like im lagging, its not responsive and snappy at all (as a racing game enthusiast this was an another disappointment, i know what good driving mechanics feel like and this is far from it).

I'm a table top RPG player so to me being able to reset skills is already too complacent, but that may annoy you.)  THE GOOD - It is mature content, it shouldn't have been otherwise - Shooter mechanics are enjoyable - Craft and weapon customization are interesting - Many graphic settings - Replayability is globally OK  THE BAD - Main storyline is too short - Poor differences in class path and choice consequences makes replayablity way less fun than it could be. - Driving is very unsatisfying to handle - No vehicle customization, very weak car degradation - AI is dumb and dumber. - It is poorly optimized and if you want everything ultra, even with a monster PC, FPS wont be great, at best. - Some graphic settings are not properly working, like getting worse definition with G-synck on.  THE UGLY - Promises of NPCs having daily routines has not been fulfilled. - Promises of dynamic and impacting weather system has not been fulfilled. - Promise of meaningful day and night cycle has not been fulfilled. - Promise of smart police tracking after a crime has not been fulfilled. - Promise of frequent flying AVS has not been fulfilled. - It could go on and on, the list of unfulfilled promises is overwhelming. - Worst of all, promise that it would be launched when ready has not been fulfilled. - There are a lot of bugs, last gen consoles version is a disgrace and PC is far from that disaster, but still it had been launched half baked. Bugs I encounter are toxic to immersion but not game breaking, except when the game mess with my sound card and randomly mix speakers in 5.1 configuration : when it happens the only solution I got is to restart my PC. - You end up with a very nice world, but interactions with it are so poor that with time it feels more and more dead. - Despite not having been promised (witch doesn't mean anything anyway as we see), some basic elements you would expect from any open world RPG are not there while it would make a lot of sense because of the Universe deeply into body modification : no esthetic surgery, no tattoo shop, no hair dresser, not even the possibility to change your make up. When your character is done, it is done. Also where is the key to holster weapon ? ... - CDPR communication is shamelessly deceiving in so many ways you can't believe whatever they tell. Also if you care for productions to be concerned about employee's well being, you wont be happy. Saying CDPR's behavior leaves a bittersweet taste is an understatement. - The ugly list is too damn long e_e  All in all CP2077 qualities are very heterogeneous. It is a good game that could have been one of the best, and may become GOTY if CDPR fulfills its promises about patches, DLCs, and bring an awesome multiplayer. BUT CDPR had been so much into deceiving their promises that there's no way we can take for granted they'll deliver.  If you are expecting the game they promised, if you are expecting a polished game, if you're expecting great additional content, don't buy, wait for CDPR to deliver.

Loved Witcher 3 and was excited to try something new from CDPR.  The game is ludicrously beautiful in terms of graphics and art design. The city is incredibly dense, immensely detailed, and a joy to explore. The graphical fidelity on PC is insane and I'm not running an RTX card - up close you can see clearly detailed individual threads on clothing and super fine textures. The designs of guns, clothing, and vehicles are pretty great throughout. I really can't stress enough how pretty the game is. Decent performance on my computer, too. Averaging around 45 FPS on nearly ultra at 1440p.  The first 15 hours were magical. The feeling of being unleashed in this vast city with your own freedom to do what you want was awesome. Collecting new weapons, leveling up, trying out missions. The story was mostly decent, though the intro for your origin story was laughable at about 15 minutes long followed by a cinematic that skips months of your life in Night City... and you basically never touch that story again. But still, fairly engaging story missions. All of it was so cool at first.  And then I hit this point where it dawned on me that I'd basically experienced everything the game had to offer in terms of gameplay in that brief amount of time. From that point on, you realize there's just not much variety here. Every smart weapon has the same effect, every tech weapon has the same effect, every NPC, regardless of what gang they're in, acts exactly the same, every side mission is the same - kill these guys, collect this thing, move on.  The NPC AI is shockingly bad, like impressively lackluster. Citizens do nothing but walk aimlessly, say one canned line of like 20 possible voice lines, and loop an animation. Enemy NPCs are completely braindead. I put almost all my points into hacking, thinking it would be this cool opportunity for cyber espionage and clever, futuristic ways of outsmarting enemies. Nope. It's basically just ""light guys on fire from a distance"" while they stand around cluelessly shouting the same threat over and over. They have no way of finding you in stealth, no way of stopping your hacking, no way of even slowing you down. It is stupidly easy, even on hard difficulty.  The cars handle like crap to the point that I don't even use them though motorcycles are a bit better. You see this cool scene when you get your first implant where it shows the ripperdoc changing your eye out, but from then on, getting now implants is just as basic as changing your character's pants. And speaking of characters, V has absolutely zero room for roleplaying options. You can't choose how you act in almost any situation because you're only presented with one scripted piece of dialogue, maybe two.  There's just this enormous rift between the story missions and the open world that makes me feel like the game was rushed and left incomplete. The open world is so sterile in terms of gameplay. All there is to do is go from boring side mission to boring side mission doing the same thing repeatedly, selling junk at vendors, and looking at new things to buy. There's almost nothing to do in terms of cyberpunk themes. There's no crooked cops, there's no interesting things happening with gangs, there's not even an appearance of these huge megacorporations that dominate their world. It's just stunning how devoid of purpose the open world is.  Now don't get me wrong, there's a certain amount of fun in the game. Like I said, I love exploring the city and the main story is decent. But otherwise, it ranges from an average to sub-average open world whack-a-mole kind of game where you blast enemies like you're in a shooting gallery and pick up a ton of crappy loot to disassemble or sell. That's the game in a nutshell.  It's disappointing for sure. The game doesn't innovate or set any standards whatsoever beyond visuals. It's a run of the mill AAA shooter with poop grade AI, terrible driving, and little to do beyond the main story. I wouldn't recommend this game honestly, I regret buying it.… Expand "

On consoles it's a whole other story but this is a review for the pc version.  RPG wise this is about as RPG as Witcher 3. It's an action game with RPG elements. But if I want an RPG I'll go back to playing Pathfinder:Kingmaker or Baldur's Gate 2.  Normally I'd give the game a 8.5 or 9, because the open world aspect is pretty poor, especially when compared with what other titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 or GTA 5 have to offer, but since I see a lot of console people coming to the PC reviews category to trash the game with 0/10, I'll just go ahead and give it a 10, to even the odds a bit.… Expand "

I mean you've seen at least one of his movies right?  The only thing that surprises me here is that people we're surprised by KR's voice acting. While the voice acting added to immersion it also removed some as well.  Because you no longer have a running log of what was said and what you said on the screen...  It can be difficult to fully appreciate the choices your making.  Polish:  This game just wasn't... at all.  There's so many bugs in so many places I'm amazed it was released in this state.  I understand games will have bugs... but this is extreme.  Combat:  This can be quite a bit of fun however some of the coolest stuff is locked behind leveling. Getting headshots, mid air, with enemies all around you with time slowed down is deeply satisfying. There's also various weapon modifications that can change how you approach various situations.  Progression: hard felt like it was hard, partly because I didn't realize I was supposed to be questing in a different part of town.  Anyhoo,  You can feel you're character is getting better in the world in which they exist.  non-linear story:  They get some points deducted here because you generally have no idea if your choice actually made a difference.  From what I've read it IS possible to change the outcome but it's not obvious to me, at all, while playing the game.  Every time I've save scummed, ON MANY QUESTS, the outcome is almost always the same.  AI:  there is almost 0 intelligence to anything AI related.  Some of the worst I've ever seen... ever. NPC's on the streets are clearly an after thought.  Car AI behaves as if they were made by a college student in a last ditch effort to pass a class.  CP gets an F here.  Crafting:  They didn't play test this enough.  Who the hell thinks it's ok to click and hold the craft button, wait 1 second.. then rinse and repeat that literally 100's of times.. WTF. pure cancer.  CP gets a C here because crafting is cool and it does add to the game... it just needs some QOL.  Breaching:  This is pretty cool, had a ton of fun with it.  I wish you could do more with  it but I'll take what I can get.  CP gets an A- here.  Balance:  It's clearly not.  The stats are multiplicative and no recalculated from the base...  I'm not sure if I have a problem with this so I'm not going to grade it. TBH,  It's fun thinking about the different types of characters you can build because of this.  Economy:  It's a static economy and I didn't expect anything more (I mean why is that need in an RPG?).  Trading:  They get an F here.  Jesus guys, So many QOL's missing on this.  I don't want to trade equipped items, so don't list em by default.  there's no quick sell for the kajillion items you have.  You might argue that QOLs aren't that important but lets be honest here.  When it comes to trading, beyond making an integer move up or down, it's all QOL.  Pace:  the game tries to rush you due to the story,  I don't think it actually makes good on that threat but it's still kinda annoying.  Why didn't you guy's say thing X will cause extreme problems for you 1 year from now.. That was a pretty foolish imo.  Weapons:  so you get pistols, machine guns, snipers, and shotguns.  there's alot of different types of those weapons mentioned.  It'd be nice if there was some more imaginative weapons? like a bouncy bomb, how about a beam weapon?  How about an acid soaker?  a flame thrower? a taser?  sure, you have weapon effects that will shock or start people on fire...but you don't have weapons that throw fire or emit electricity visually.  If you're looking for the next GTA, keep looking. If you're looking for a great rpg, you should buy this game.… Expand "

The voice acting is one of the highlights for me, it's one of the best I've seen in the last decade, but it is shadowed by some bugs and a very bad performance. I don't have a spaceship PC, but it is equal to a PS4, and this game was supposed to run decently on those kinds of specs. But for now, even with everything on low-medium, my FPS struggle to maintain 30. I've been playing Valhalla as well and with almost all settings on high, I'm getting 30-45 FPS. And it is a Ubisoft game.. c'mon. I know that  CDPR is a decent company and they will do something about it.

I think rating a game based on bugs is odd, since most new releases have them, and they usually go away as the game gets patched.  I guess I have been a PC gamer for so long that I expect this.  I have enjoyed every minute of my time in Cyberpunk 2077.  There's so much to do.  You could make taking criminals down in side quests a full time job without touching the rest of the game.  The story and characters so far, are the really engaging.  They make you feel connected to them, even though you may have just met them.  The game has some amazing writing, which intertwines several different story arcs together in a seamless and interesting way that makes the player feel like they are walking in the shoes of someone in Night City.  Graphics:  Regarding performance, I have a very high end system with an RTX 3090, so I am seeing very solid performance, but have had to watch the digital foundry optimization video for some tips on how to get the best quality/performance balance.  I can say that this game looks truly remarkable when you get to the point where you have the quality/performance balance.  DLSS is so helpful!  Sound is great!  I like all of the radio station selections.  Sound effects are solid, and voice acting is amazing.  So much dialogue in this game, it's insane.  Story:  I have played a lot of games, and this one has a story that reminds me why it's awesome to be a gamer.  There are so many options on what direction to take in the game, and each on seems to be crafted with love and extreme detailing and knowledge of the genre.  Just fantastic!!!  Characters:  The main character, V, is a really cool character that really pulls off the role well.  The NPCs that you interact with throughout the game are all really engaging and believable.  Very well done here.  Environment:  Each area in the game is so detailed, and I think the fact that they were able to have so many NPCs walking around and cars driving about makes this feel like a much more realistic place, especially since the population in the future is only going to make things more crowded and messy.  I like all of the attention to detail here.  There's little tidbits of history strewn throughout the game in the way of conversations, downloads from data sticks found throughout the world, and other media.  Night City and the surrounding areas really come to life here.  Combat is pretty good here.  There's a lot to it.  Guns are punchy, and the dismemberment is a nice touch.… Expand "

So expectations were high. CD Projekt Red felt like one of the few good companies left. Man was I wrong.  Cyberpunk is an absolute joke. There are three good things with the game. The first hour of gameplay. The enviroment/art-style looks cool as hell and really breath-taking at times (get it?) and the guns feel alright. That's it.  So what are the negative things with Cyberpunk?  * Terrible character customization (not even Zoom or bodytypes? really? REALLY? 2021 and Dragon Age from 2009 has better Customization)  * Terrible AI. Games like GTA which came out years ago has better AI (especially in city streets, how they react to situations). This is an absolute disaster in Cyberpunk. Police who don't care if you shoot someone infront of them, people who only have one animation if you shoot a car. Police spawning and directly starting to shoot you. It's just so friggin terrible. Hell even Oblivion had a ""go to jail"" system - ""Stop you violated the law"".  * Music is terrible.  The Witcher had some of the greatest music in gaming, probably because it's was a folk-band from Poland making most of the music and not the composer. Because man is the soundtrack to Cyberpunk bad. Where are the vangelis/Mass effect big dreamy 80's inspired synth soundtrack? Nowhere to be found. Instead with are left with a bunch of screechy bs which nobody with half an ear can like, you just want to turn the radio right off as soon as you get into a car to add to it. Mass Effect 1-3 has so much better music. Hell even Bladerunner from like 97 does.  * Lack of Choice. There is no choice at all. You are just allowed one option all the time. Doesn't matter what you do.  * Your actions don't matter. Run into someone with your car? No problem. Run a red light? No problem. Shoot a whole gang up? No problem you will just get a topjob from their boss anyway 5 min later.  Want to say something cool in a conversation? Sorry you are only allowed one option. Even Wasteland 3 did this so much better.  * No factions (!?). I thought I could choose to become a CORP and that it would be a faction and mean something, that the story would build around your choice... wow I get a 10 min intro and a  useless option every 20th conversation to say something related to CORP knowledge that doesnt matter anyway.... truly immersive.  *The Quests are terrible. ""Gigs"" and other things, feels like a bad Ubisoft game most of the time.  * Censorship of sex and other things (like shooting wounds, if you shoot someone.. they don't even get a wound). We have a dark gritty world, but still censorship? A world full of sex and ""degeneracy"" as the devs put it in like 2013, but everything is censored. What a joke.  * The animations are ok at best.  * You cannot steal cars and keep them or have some kind of system for it? Why even buy cars when you can just steal any car all the time?  * No factions as was promised. Wanted to be a corp? Too bad, it doesn't matter one fu**ing bit.  * Story is overall bad and the story-moments are mediocre at best. With few exceptions. There are good moments to be fair, but they are way too far between.  *Most characters are boring and uninteresting. With few exceptions, for example a certain person who doesn't stick around for very long.  I played 35-40 hours. Didn't even want to go back to the game. I even tried to really like this game, but it's impossible. So I uninstalled and haven't looked back. Biggest gaming dissapointment ever.… Expand "

Rpg my brown ass, the few choices you make practically dont make any difference, why choose corpo, street kid or the other one(it is that forgettable) when the outcome is litteraly the same. The other choices through the game dont impact too much in the games story. Equiptment is kind of cool, but nothing i cared too much, where in other rpgs were a big deal. The weapons have great designs, the cars and other but the few changes you make too them dont really add with the open world and rpg aestethic.  The shooting is fine, but what you shoot at is not, sayme looking guys, sayme playing guys and just boring enemies. This is a science fiction game and you have as much variety as gta san andreas. Worst of all, the ai SUCKS, they respond as effective as Goldeneye AI. There are lots of playstyles, thats a positive. Also there is a lots of **** snipers, bombs and well it sucks. The only times i died were one shot deads, cause the game appears to think that you are stupid enough too not use the innihalators or whataver too brute force the game. The game is just too easy.  Is quite sad cause the game looks awesome, speccialy with Ray Tracing, but visuals are soo much when the game feels so dead. So repetitve, so uninteresting, so boring. The story didnt made me feel anything, the characters were forgettable and the game is just that, forgettable.  I could talk about bugs and things like that, but the game is fundamentally bad, so i dont care. I found some bugs, mostly car related. Nothing too gamebreaking so thats that.

If you want world building, variety, multi layered characters, a science fiction world, with unique boss fights, build up, a multi choices story, interesting missions, and a open world to rival witcher 3 in its stuff to do, then you will be dissapointed.

It's good that CDPR said, that you can get money back for a ps4/xbox1 game that you have already played.  Yes, there are bugs, but it is nothing in comparison with the world and game-play. Combat system is good, weapons are different and interesting. Graphic is really good even on my low-mid PC (Ryzen 2700x + 1080 Ti) - ultra settings on fullhd, and it looks beautiful, all these buildings, lights, technics. I can't understand those people or children, who complains about graphics on really low PCs, what did you expect from modern game? And may be i'm too old, but i think that graphic is not the main thing, the game is great without that.  It's useful to note a large number of Easter eggs. Stories on chips are interesting. They really dip in this crazy world. All of the main missions are highly interesting. And side missions are not far behind, if it is not trivial kill or theft (you can skip them if you want).  All bugs that i met wasn't critical like crash or something similar. Maximum - reload from control point in mission.  But the game is missing some things, like character editing after creation, cars modifying, more intelligent AI. I think that some of them will be added in future.  I hope that the developers will fix bugs and optimize game soon.… Expand "

Basically I've been a gamer since the mid 1970's and have played nearly everything over the last 40+ years on one platform or another, but Cyberpunk is almost exclusively made for PC to it's full potential, not even the PS5 or Xbox Series X gets close to the level of detail or immersion this game can do on a PC.  Now firstly comparisons, the game is a blend of the original Deus Ex game from 20 years ago, mixed with Fallout 3/4, and maybe a bit of GTA5. It literally has the best of each of those games, backed by a fantastic developer that doesnt belive in crippling the experience with DRM, and that supports their games usually with 5 years of free content and patches.  Now it is true that the game is riddled with bugs, but I've logged about 30 hours now and it's been very minimal, I can point out maybe 5 times I spotted something (NPC standing in the T position seen twice, NPC clipping through others again about two noticable times, seen a bin fly 10 ft off the ground up due to scenery clipping, and occasional flickering in photo mode, and thats it.... nothing game breaking or beyond what I would expect from a game of this time at launch). I'd imagine a lot of the early reports here were due to playing before the official 1.04 update and unlucky hardware/driver combinations, cos for me it's close to flawless.  CDPR made the correct descison to go full first person, it made the world look amazing and personal, and not just another 3rd person game made for console audiences. It pays of hugely even just wandering around and seeing the sights as it is breath-taking at times, especially at night when Ray tracing really shows off the quality. It has definately been worth the weight. I've seen the console versions benchmarks on youtube and frankly they shouldnt have ported it to the last gen consoles as they simply cant do it justice, so I would avoid the console versions entirely.  For me this is game of the decade, not Red Dead 2, not Last of Us, not Ghost of Tashima etc. The Witcher 3 which they made previously held the title for me, and has now finally been pushed off the top spot.… Expand "

That said, what CDPR did by telling people that ""it runs 'suprisingly well' on PS4 & Xbox One"" was beyond sleazy.

Cutscenes and are great, main characters are spot on. - Graphics is great, especially when using RTX, which makes frame rate dip far below 60 in many scenes even on RTX 3080 that you barely can get anywhere these days.  Not so good/dissapointing: - My main disappointment is that the open world is blank, empty etc. in terms of mechanics. Nothing seems to have a substance or feel to it, everything is just there for you to look at, just mere appearance of a city. - Game lacks content and variety, there are almost zero mini-games, professions, factions etc. No car tuning, even no barber shop or tatoo shop, which is bizzare. -RPG systems are weak, because there is no real transmog and not many options to fine-tune your experience or equipment outside of some not so interesting mods. - Some minor things, like HUD has no tranparency option, map in uniformative and all secondary missions no matter the type has exactly the same question mark icon etc. You cannot unfollow any mission for just free-roam, a reminder always stays in the screens right corner, unless you switch of HUD in potions menu. - Lots of readable lore with no real interest to dive into it. - Outdated stealth, shooting, driving - gameplay in general. - No endgame or new game + , replayability also seems limited.  Really not that good: - Tons of bugs that break immersion.  After fixing performance and bugs, I might as well give this game a 8 - 8.5, but it needs more major changes to be done in order to deliver what was initially promised.

This will be a spoiler-free review.  What I could say about Cyberpunk I could not fit in a 5000 character limit, so I won't even try to do it but I will express what I have on my mind after freshly beating it.  Cyberpunk is an atmospheric thriller. My system is older, and the game ran just well enough for me to enjoy it. It wasn't fantastic, and I would not say the game is optimized but I pushed through, but the visuals were great. The city does feel like one of the most detailed hand crafted maps in a video game I've ever played - however, while nothing feels same-y, there is very little to actually do outside of missions. From my experience there are no casinos, actual restaurants, properties, mini-games or more. This isn't the worst thing, but what little marketing I saw made me believe that would not be the case and there'd be more to do.  The characters are enjoyable, and the felt unique enough. No characters felt like filler, or like they were too similar to another. Voice acting in almost all instances were excellent. I do have a few complaints in regards to a few characters but they weren't awful. Keanu's performance at the beginning was strange, and then soon after it got genuinely lifeless, however he does fix that not too long after that, it turned out much better than I thought. Grimes' character was another glaring instance of strange emotionless voice acting, there are times where its done well, but a few lines threw me off.  The RPG mechanics are fine, nothing incredible and certainly nothing unique but they served their purpose. Gear was sparse and the stats I found on them were strange, you did have the option to buy them but it felt worthless to do so as I always seemed to find better pieces from killing enemies. I often looked very goofy and not exactly how I pictured myself but there are outifts to remedy that but I just couldn't find many. Guns are fine, they're separated into categories that break down by type and they have unique perks like ricocheting and more. There is a degree of customization and upgrades with your guns but its not super complicated which is nice. Some guns come with mod slots and attachment slots, I did not see both but I'd be surprised if they didn't exist, and all guns come with sight slots so you can get a sight that suits your preferences.  The side missions I was told were not that compelling and often felt like fetch quests, however I did not feel like that at all, I think they really delved deeper into the characters we knew or introduced to new fascinating ones.  The games story is strange, I have in my notes when I first started ""The exposition is compelling, then strange, cliché but compelling prologue."" I redacted the sections with spoilers, but after finishing I felt that best fits it. I'd say the story is strange not because it makes no sense, but the way its told at the start is very confusing, it does come to you pretty quick, in my notes there's a progression of me confused and eventually getting it, but its a quick process.  The plot is well established but like many other games makes you feel like you have to rush and cannot do side content. I did end up doing side content, but I did not do a ton, but I finished several side story lines. What I once believed to be a cliché or common cyberpunk trope ended up turning into something much more developed and much deeper and thoughts I had written in my notes are not what ended up coming to fruition. Its not overly lengthy, and the beginning up until the end is very enjoyable.  The endings are where things get different. My ending wasn't bad, but it left a lot of questions and things to be desired, however the other endings I watched and read offer far less closure. I understand why the game wants to be open ended with their endings but it does frustrate me to a degree. I will warn you now, as the game does, when you start your ending mission you cannot come back. No matter what ending you have, you are unable to return to the city to continue things afterward. This should not be taken as a spoiler, as it doesn't really indicate anything other than you need to save as you start your final mission. I do not expect to see any DLC or updates to remedy my questions, but it did not ruin my experience with the game, it just left me a bit annoyed.… Expand "

The lights, textures, buildings and characters look great. I was just experiencing the game as it was intended - not analyzing traffic or passerby scripts - and i loved the views. Plenty of times i've been just taking photos to admire the beauty of the game. + Never before i've experienced such intense and gripping dialogues in game - characters move, interact with items around, gesture and use face expressions - it's just marvelous to watch them. + Main story is nice - i really like this much more 'earthbound' story. Especially the ending - it was a bit unpredictable and moving. + Exploration of the Night City and it's surroundings is a treat for RPG lovers - i've not used a quick travel options once. I just enjoy riding a car through the streets while looking around. + Fair RPG elements - even tho many would say the game lack's RPG elements - i disagree. You can create your own character and your playstyle - and it does a difference. I was able to sneak past the guards countless numbers of time thanks to my skills - oppening some doors, hacking systems etc. It was very rewardind to find out there's always a route for my style of play during the mission. + Dubbing (english) is really really good. Actors are charismatic, full of energy and they fit their roles very well. + Non-linear gameplay - Even tho the game might not be hinting that - plenty of times you can change the outcome of mission by simply exploring or taking some side action. The game contains dozens of hidden scripts you may not even find and it's prepared for it - characters will pay attention to your actions. Sometimes such actions may even affect the main story later on giving you more options.  - As a common knowledge says - at this point of time the game is quite buggy. I've seen flying cars (not intentionaly), objects floating around or not spawning at all (for example a part of street wasnt there when i was driving so i flew underneeth the whole level) and scripts not firing when expected. Thankfully nothing that a quick load wouldn't help with. - Altough there's many good, funny or interresting side quests to experience (and i've made evey single one in the game) - there's also some boring and irritating ones - when you have to walk around looking for some stupid clues with a scanner. I've literally spent like 20 minutes walking around like a freak just to find out i've already picked up the clue - i just had to fish it inside the Inventory and examine but the game didn't tell me that). - UI could be better - It's still pretty fine, tho browsing inventory is a nightmare.

The game is well optimized on PC as far as I'm concerned. CDPR kept their promise, and delivered a truly breathtaking experience that grabs you right by the throat and doesn't let you go till the very end! The story in this game is something that will never be forgotten once you've truly been through it, and I truly believe it will be talked about for many many years to come. Night City is it's own character, it is living and breathing  and I've never felt so immersed in any other fictional world ever before... There simply are no words for the feelings this game has evoked in me. Cyberpunk is absolutely gorgeous and pleasing to look at and I simply could not take my eyes off it. (High settings , 1080p on PC) The gameplay is great and fluent as can be expected and the sound design and music pushes the immersion and sheer enjoyment to a whole new level.  The RPG systems implemented are very much indepth and interesting, encouraging a lot of replayability. The content in this game just seems never ending , there is always more to do and it's truly seen how much time and hard work truly went into every single quest, side-quest and side-activity. ... Now yes the game has bugs and glitches, some of them more noticable some of them less, and yes they sadly do have the potential to retract from the experience. Thankfully during my playtime so far I didn't encounter any bad ones, but i know some people did. For them I am whole heartedly sorry. Still I'm sure that CDPR is working relentlessly to fix all the problems and I'm sure they will. Give them time , don't condemn the game or the company. I'm looking forward to future updates and hotfixes drastically improving the game.  Simply put , I am absolutely in love with this game and i can whole heartedly say that it delivered on my expectations, in some things even surpassed them.(In the story).

So many of these negative reviews seem to stem from the current need to bash anything that gets hyped (though I'll concur this game should never have been released for the PS4 and Xbox One and should have been released only on PC and next-gen consoles (trying to cover all the bases was a recipe for disaster)). If this was another rushed-release, money grab from a major company I would understand. CDPR has been one of the few companies these days that genuinely seems to care about delivering a quality products.

Side missions are fantastic and have better plots than some main games, this has always been CDPR forte and they deliver here again. Why only an 8 then?I was hoping this would be a true RPG and on this it doesn’t truly deliver. Maybe this is due to how hyped this game was, but I don’t think they helped themselves with the marketing on this either. Comparing to RDR2 the npcs feel so much more alive and realistic, it’s a really lived in world, you can take time to immerse yourself in the community where this never feels possible in cyberpunk. All the npcs feel so plastic and pointless, the police AI is non existent and the need to go down a certain build such as a tech engineer or a gun slinger isn’t really necessary at all.

Especially where everyone compare that games like every mechanic of GTA is better than CP. Why nobody made 1-1 comparision showing pros and cons of both games, especially when some mechanics are much better made in CP than in GTA (like blood spread, NPC reaction when you take out a gun, more advanced destruction of the indoor environment and a lot of more).

Everything else though, it ranges from okayish to plain awful. Not talking about the bugs and glitches, I completely understand all the negative reviews and I was going to give it a lower score originally, but after some thoughts I don't think that this does it justice.  Yes the AI is horrible, the world feels kind of empty, the combat and driving is okay, nothing else stands out as amazing really, but then I thought about all other open world games I played. Was any of this great in any of these games? Not really. I admit that the game is in a completely unfinished state and they could have done a much better job in many aspects of the game, but that's not why people play CDPR games. They play their games because they go the extra mile just to tell an amazing story that resonates through the player's choices. On this aspect they didn't disappoint.  Cyberpunk isn't a mindless open world game with meaningless quests, boring story and repetitive content (though they did add some of it, but it can be ignored). The story is engaging all the way, side quests are just as important and integral to the story as the main quest is and each characters have their own distinct personality and charm to fall in love with (not talking about the romance options here).  If you're looking for a GTA 5 style of game, this game is probably not for you. But if you enjoyed The Witcher games for its story, you'll thoroughly enjoy Cyberpunk 2077 as long as you are able to ignore the negative stuff. The game is slow and story-heavy, not so much a game where the fun is just to mess around and shoot people.  My only recommendation to new players is to focus on the ""main jobs"" and ""side jobs"" in your journal and ignore all the ""Gigs"" and NCPD stuff, unless you need more money. The game doesn't do a very good job at distinguishing between the good quests from the bad filler quests and starting from act 2 will overwhelm you with so many stuff at once that you won't be able to keep up with all of them. The ""main jobs"" are just the main quest line and the ""side jobs"" are for the most part the good side quests. Some of them branch off the main quest and follow the characters we meet along the road through an elaborate string of quests and stay relevant to the main story, others just have interesting stories (I particularly liked the Sinnerman quest line), and some are just short and funny. Only a few side jobs weren't fun, the ones that come to mind are the fighting ones and cyberpsycho. Some though might appear boring at first, but turn out to be really good.  As a last note, I just want to say that if they'd worked one more year on the game and fixed all the broken stuff, I'm sure it would have been a strong contender for game of the year, but because the game is so broken, it distracts us from its true merit: its story and the way it tells it.… Expand "

avintagephoto,"Dec 20, 2020",9," In and out, it feels like a CD Project Red game. The stories not obvious and neither are the choices. The story was slow up until you get to know Johnny. Everything around him, made me curious. If you like the Witcher 3, then this game will live up to your expectations. The game has plenty of bugs but reloading the last save would fix 95% of them. "
redhawx13,"Dec 20, 2020",10," Game is superbly good and I have 0 complaints. Stop comparing this to GTA because it's an extremely different concept and mechanics. Everyone who's a software developer will agree for such a big game, their bugs are very insignificant. Also regarding performance, it's  freaking next gen game. It is designed to push people to move on to next gen hardware. People just have the wrong expectation. "

In my opinion, the plot is 10/10, they just need to patch up the game itself.  To sum up - everyone expected something different from this game, hence we have such a wide spectrum of opinions - from hysterics shouting that this game is lost and needs to be done completely from scratch, to people who, despite problems, have a great time.… Expand "

Ее сложно оценивать, абстрагировавшись от ее пиар компании и образа “идеальной” игры для всех. Так как большинство людей читают обзоры в стим исключительно для подсчета отрицательных и положительных отзывов, свои более глубокие рассуждения оставлю на потом, а сейчас подведу краткий итог исключительно о игре, и о том стоит ли она внимания. Киберпанк 2077 далеко не идеальна, но поиграть в нее действительно стоит. Для меня главными плюсами игры являются сюжет и визуальная составляющая. За взаимоотношениями Джонни и Ви действительно интересно наблюдать. Персонажи меняются. Меняются их взаимоотношения и взгляды на мир. Лор показался мне очень привлекательным. В первую очередь потому что тема капитализма, находящегося в идейном кризисе, мне крайне интересна. Говоря о минусах, главный из них это конечно техническая сырость игры. В игре частенько встречаются баги. Они не сильно влияют на геймплей, но портят атмосферу. А так же дополнительныe квесты не дотягивают до уровня Ведьмак 3.  И вот столь обожаемая студия заявляет о скором выходе своего самого грандиозного проекта. Начинается не менее грандиозная пиар компания. Под ее влияние попадают абсолютно все. Даже люди, не игравшие в Ведьмак 3, превращаются в фанатов CDP, потому что уважаемая студия обещает выпустить игру, которая изменит в игровой индустрии все. Лично у меня к Киберпанку 2077 не было завышенных ожиданий. Я ждал игру похожую на Ведьмак 3 в сетинге Киберпанка. Поэтому мои ожидания были даже превзойдены, ведь настолько глубокого и интересного сюжета я не ожидал. Большинство же было повергнуто в шок. Игра вышла сырой (у Ведьмака на старте тоже были технические проблемы), и не была чем-то революционно новым. И тут на CDP посыпались тонны негатива, который в большинстве своем оправдан. По сути весь негатив направлен в сторону менеджмента CDP, а не самой игры. Если говорить честно, то Киберпанк 2077 исключительно как игру обсуждают довольно мало. И мне в этой ситуации по истине жаль разработчиков. Ведь сама игра вышла великолепной, но вот руководство студии сделало все, чтобы Киберпанк стал провалом. Релиз Киберпанка показывает, как легко можно потерять репутацию, наработанную годами. Самое ироничное, что в Киберпанке показана антиутопия, в которой корпорации перемалывают людей ради собственной выгоды. Так и в CDP ставили своим сотрудникам нереальные задачи, заставляли кранчить по 6 дней в неделю, и обманывали своих фанатов ради получения прибыли. 10 декабря 2020 года можно считать днем, когда умерла последняя по истине любимая народом AAA студия.

There will be some bugs, of course, but I play Elder Scrolls Online which is 6 years old, and there are still a lot of bugs, so you have to wait a few months for a smoother gameplay.

I got through the game 100%, I chose all 3 story paths. Even, Mafia 3 was much better than this. To start with, the game's lore is blatantly ripped from works like Akira (the idea of atomic bombing, motorcycles and such a city) and the Ghost in the Armor, the color interface, scanner, implants, city and **** everything is ripped from there. The game, even if it was bug-free, is still weak. Especially in the contrast that after cyberpunk I played rdr 2. The plot in Cyberpunk 2077 is childish and nonsensical. The dialogue sparks a huge amount of inappropriate profanity. What do I mean by ""inappropriate swear words""? I mean the fact that they are put in the sentence as if the scriptwriter had the task to put foul words in the already written dialogues so that the schoolchildren would eat them up and immediately think that this is ""adult dialogue"" when they saw the dialogues with foul words. Even more and the constant demonstration of naked bodies. I certainly do not mind, but think about who the developers of this in the game attract.  The game positions itself as an rpg, but rpg is not. It's just a **** up. Most people have somehow conveniently forgotten about it (who praises cyberpunk), but I remember everyone screaming about it back in 2017 when I first heard about the upcoming game. How excited I was to see such a game come out, because I'm a fan of the genre. My favorite movie - Blade Runner 2049, but here's the trouble, the game **** in everyone's eyes and like in the tale of the naked king many do not want to admit that cyberpunk is **** **** and we were given instead of a cool rpg weak in terms of story, lame in terms of gameplay, soapy in terms of graphics, inexperienced in terms of music and raw in terms of sound ""game"". The story is short, not all the characters are revealed and I was bored to play it. I didn't sympathize with Johnny, I didn't sympathize with V because her past is told to the max from the way we chose to create the character. The secondary missions are the worst side quests I've ever seen in my life. In Assassin they are much more interesting. II liked the easter egg realted to Portal 2. In the game I did not know where to spend the money except on implants, which were often too expensive, but the worst thing is that even the implants were not always necessary to buy, because they can be trivially stolen and they will be better in rarity. It turns out that the money wasn't really needed either. Then I don't know where to spend it at all. Buying cars is nonsense. Better to steal or ride on your kart. The game is trivial no garage, or tuning. The game, even the **** subway is not implemented. Can you imagine? The subway, which was on the art and trailers, and there's no air transport, which is demonstrated at the beginning of the game for the corporat. Sea transport, too, no. This is banal absurd, the game has no gameplay variety, everything rolls into shootouts and driving. Maybe they've got something in the shootouts then? No. There's an attempt to create different classes in the game, but for lack of experience, time and brains the developers instead of a normal, quality perks tree made some **** that's only suitable for lineage 2, or WOW, but definitely not for first person action rpg. Most of the perks you learn are trash, which raises a couple percent of your stats. There are certainly useful perks, but they are in the minority. It's like I was not playing a singleplayer game, but an online mmo with constant farming (although that's how it is). For some reason, the developers have scattered around the world a lot of the same type of junk like ""needle"", etc. The question is: Why? This stuff is not worth anything, it is the same and adding the same type of things throughout the game so even that costs a penny - nonsense. In 3A game most of the interesting things are served in a text format, but here's a question: Why the **** in the 3A game, which was made from 2011 to 2020 most of the interesting things served in **** txt documents? The shooting and physics in the game are terrible. In the beginning we are given to smash a wall with a big machine gun. And guess what, that's the only wall we can smash with a machine gun in the game, w-o-w. This shows the whole attitude from the developers to the player. The prologue gives the illusion of elaboration, but just when you start to believe it, the developer immediately lets you know that you've sucked. The funny thing is that even no sound of ripping off just this machine gun in game, and also in the landfill there is no sound of walking on the garbage. Do you think there is no activity? No, there are, and the funny thing is that the trash scattered, and under it forgot to lay the texture and I'm trivial in it a couple of times got stuck and I had to download the last save. I as a player give it a well-deserved 0 out of 10 points.… Expand "

Начну сразу с минусов игры, а он единственный - техническое составляющее. Я играл на патче 1.52, наиграл на данный момент чуть более ста часов и скажу сразу, что баги НЕ КРИТИЧЕСКИЕ, играть МОЖНО ЛЕГКО, это уже далеко не те баги, которые выходили на релизе, есть просто баги с подтупливанием ИИ, коллизией, физикой,иногда ещё живыми трупами, но это не радикально и не встречается на каждому шагу, это присутствует пару раз в час. Конечно, не стоит не учитывать этот факт, ведь он присутствует и многим недовольным геймерам знатно так трепает пуканы. Дальше перейду к главной особенности и шедевральности этой игры -а это сюжет и персонажи. Смогу смело сказать, что те люди, хоть их и не много, которые забрасывают Киберпанк помоями за сюжет, явно не разбираются ни в правильном построении и развитии этого же сюжета, ни просто в кино. Сюжет построен очень грамотно и развивает персонажей отталкиваясь от логической цепочки, биографии и их целей. Скажу честно, но даже к началу игры (постараюсь без спойлеров) игра уже заставляет тебя пробивать слёзы и давать волю эмоциям, уж я молчу про финал, хоть я и прошёл пока что на одну концовку. У игры так же присутствует шикарная атмосфера будущего, как в плане архитектуры, визуальных красок открытого мира, его построения, так и в плане приоритетов и нужд обычного населения, очень хорошо это подчёркивается в диалогах, которые можно услышать от обычных говорящих НПС в городе. Что касаемо музыки и просто сопровождающего геймлпей саунда....... Отмечу, что я далеко не ярый фанат жанра рока, но мой плейлист после игры в Киберпанк увеличился на качающие и классные песни, которые подарила как мне, так и другим пользователям игра. Как рок, так и шикарно подобранный в целом саунд под разные ситуации, будь то серьёзный диалог, месиво, эмоциональные ситуации, сложные в плане выбора моменты - везде музыкальное сопровождение сидит так, как лучше ты его просто не сделаешь, именно атмосфера, персонажи, диалоги, сюжет со свободным выбором и именно этот сопровождающий саунд - заставляют тебя полюбить эту игру, погружаться в неё настолько глубоко, что потом ты становишься просто зависимым и игра в Киберпанк становится сравнимо дозе для наркомана.… Expand "

And that's the primary reason for my low score, the game looks beautiful, the city is amazing and in terms of art design is the most detailed I've seen.  But that's where the sense of awe ends, because when you actually go out to explore the city, you find there is pretty much nothing to do.  You can't even sit on a bench in a park.  The quests that are finished are good, but there are many which are clearly after thoughts added in to rush the game out.   Even questlines that appear finished are missing content.  I romanced Panam and as soon as the climax of the romance happened its like her character turned off.  Going to see her in the Aldecados camp offers only 3 conversation options.  There's no further interaction with her until (if) you chose to ask her for help at the end of the game.

I played the game for more than 80 hours, and I am on my second playthrough, and I have to say, this is the most disappointing game I have ever played, of course this was never going to deliver on the hype, not even Half Life 3 had this level of hype. I played this on PC and it was a bugfest, a game that clearly needed like 6 more months to be completed, but leaving the bugs aside I can say this is a mediocre title. Story wise is good, a short but really cool campaign. If you are playing this just for the story then yes you will enjoy it, but you have to ignore the terrible mediocre game behind it. This was advertised as next level RPG, and that is a lie, there is a skill three that honestly feels like an afterthought, the game doesn't even let you customize the character looks after you have created it, you cant even get a haircut or modify your body aesthetics, the ripperdocs allow you to get some basic upgrades but they are very generic and nothing impactful. The life paths are a joke, other than a different starting area and like a single exclusive mission, you play the exact same person weather you choose corpo, nomad or streetkid. The leveling feels like you are just unlocking boring passive points that have impact but you cant feel it as they don't change the game mechanics. The loot system is ok, guns feel really nice when you shoot and the gun combat is ok, but broken, almost anything can one shot. There is a certain type of weapon were you can shoot through walls and that is just plain stupid, enemies can't see you, but you can see them, and all you have to do is shoot behind cover to kill them. Katanas and melee weapons feel ok, they can be fun but the melee combat is horrible, those missions were you have to fight other NPCs are boring and nothing like in the Witcher 3. Loot feels generic, a lot of trash and most things you pick will end up being salvaged for materials that you will later use for the crafting system, and the crafting system is so basic that I don't know why it's included, you can't customize your guns other than a silencer or an scope, some mods and that's it, we definitely expected way more. Legendary weapons are really fun but make the game so much easier, but the thing I dislike the most about this game is the open world, it's filled with fetch quests, repetitive missions to increase your street credit to unlock more repetitive missions, go here, kill some people, grab a laptop, hack a system, all very much the same, making money in this game is really easy as well as the economy is completely broken. The world feels huge, and really beautiful but also dead, it's like walking on a city filled with brainless bots, there are no bars to do cool things, no arcade games or other fun activities that  don't involve combat. I expected to breath NIght City, to see NPCs reacting to me, but they all feel the same, they behave like a bunch of cowards when you shoot, and if you follow one of them they are just following a circular path just pretending to do something to create the illusion of a crowd and the police, it's so bad that they spawn anywhere if you shoot a civilian or comit a crime, they SPAWN, and all you have to do to loose them is walk a bit or grab a car and run away, they don't chase you, its so bare bones that you can tell they rushed this system.  This is a mediocre game in all aspects other than the story, the graphics are nice, but nothing impressive, I feel like CDPR had a fantastic concept but the scope of it was too big for their team and it's a real shame because I know that this could have been a fantastic game.

Not once have I experienced any sort of slowdown, crashes, or quest/game-breaking bugs. In fact, I have gone whole sessions without seeing any bugs at all. And what I have experienced has been only minor visual glitches, which do happen but they are nothing serious and don't hinder the experience.  Games like Skyrim had/have much more serious issues yet that game has been praised into oblivion. Not to diss Skyrim but this game is amazing, it reminds me of all the best elements of a Bethesda RPG mixed with the immersive simulation of games like Deus Ex or Prey. The story (so far) is fantastic, the combat feels great with the wealth of choice it gives the player, role playing and customization is extensive and rewarding, the music is killer, and the world is both visually stunning and a joy to explore.  When I read these negative reviews I can't help but think people must be playing an entirely different game. Either that or people are trying to run this on their old Dell desktop from 1998. I understand the hate if you bought the PS4/Xbox One version, if that was the only version I had access to I would be upset as well. But if you have any sort of decent PC then there shouldn't be an issue. By no means do I have the most advanced or expensive hardware. Maybe I'm just lucky, who knows.

I actually think that most people complaining about bugs are totally over reacting and not really equaly fair to the game in anyway when i see what they complain about. Everyone i know has basically same minor issues like me and nothing major. other games like Horizon zero dawn, Death stranding Watch dogs legions etc where way more broken in every single way on release then Cyberpunk so i dont understand what people even complain so much about.  Now there are some legit complains though from me . The life path choices  at the start give a very short introduction only that will confuse people. There are also allot of systems and Menu items / finding stuff and how it works is hard and take a whole playthrough before you even understand how most systems in the game work. This leads you to mess up stuff or miss stuff and not understanding allot of stuff. On top of that starting life path are way to short.. You get kicked right into some action and the are right away almost at the junction point where all life path meet in the start. This is really disapointing for me.  Same with the endings a bit .. They are really different but the core ending basically feels still the same. The game also is not able because its rushing the story it seems to attach me to the characters as well as witcher 3 did where i still today cry at some points... I never did feel the same attachements to the Cyberpunk characters . The story is good and well done but i just cant get that attached because its a bit to much rushed after people complaining that witcher 3 was to long.  The game has bigger issues like police reactions are done really bad and need rework but all in all the core game is still a very good game. With all the bugs i would give it a 8/10 but since they soon for sure get fixed i give the game a 9/10 because all in all even with its issues and complains it is still a very good game that has big replay value and is clearly worth my time and money… Expand "

Even the experience of walking down a crowded street in Night City especially now that we're all locked down cause of the pandemic is really awesome.  I like the story and the writing is good, the world feels complex, and the characters are developed in a way that has depth... It gives a good enough illusion to feel immersed in the world of Cyberpunk 2077.  Graphically the game is stunning but what is better is the attention to detail in models and locations which really feel very real.  Performance seems to be an issue for some , I'll just preface that I have not had issues but I play it on a reasonable PC, it is not the latest greatest ( I9-9900k + RTX 2080 Ti) but it is quite decent. At ultra 3440 × 1440 works well enough not to notice issues. My framerates were in the ~45 fps range with DLSS enabled.  Some will cringe that 45 is low , but for a single player game, trying to experience the story and have it look stunning, this works well for me. And personally until I enabled the FPS counter in steam I had no idea what the value is but my senses can't really tell the difference between 60 or 45 so at this point FPS is just a number.  I'm sure there will be optimization fixes which will make this run better. What is important is that the writing is good, the story is immersive, and NC feels real ... this is a really good game, and I would strongly recommend it as it is worth it… Expand "

Diversity always comes at the cost of immersion.  - Graphics: it looks amazing. Sure, it could have still been better in certainI played the game for 70 hours before writing this and finished it. Did (to my knowledge) most of the interesting side quests too.  The good: - Story: most immersive story in a game to date. Yes it is fairly linear but the same goes for all similar games. Diversity always comes at the cost of immersion. - Graphics: it looks amazing. Sure, it could have still been better in certain aspects but for the type of game it is, it does not have a lot of competition - Music: For me personally the one area where it actually has no competition. I do realise it caters towards my preferences while most games do not but at the same time there's  a lot of music in there that is definitely not for me so I'm sure it pleases a wide crowd. In the 70 hours I never got bored of the music which is the first time that happens in a game. - FPS: It's essentially a good FPS game and I often resorted to shooting as the best solution  Questionable: - The skill tree: It's generally not useful/necessary enough to get into it. Sure in a second play through I'd go specifically for those things that have some use but you can finish the game leaving a lot of points uninvested. - Stealth/Hacking: It has its uses but it's often rather tedious and after a few failures it's often clear you might as well just walk in with the intent and the tactic to kill everyone even in situations where you're supposed to be stealthy - Lack of true next-gen Open World: there's nothing really ground breaking about the Open World implementation  The Bad: - Glitches: while there are no major game-breaking bugs, there are plenty of story-breaking glitches. People showing up in places they are not supposed to be, walking through objects, inconsistent conversations. Overall they are easy enough to overlook but it's obvious that most of these are easy to fix. Unfortunately makes it still feel like a bit of a rushed job. - Open World NPC AI: We're 2020, it really takes minimal effort get open world AI to be better than what it is - Mini games (racing, boxing): they bothered to weave some into the story but actually didn't bother to add them as a pass time for the open world (plus add some more)  One thing that I see pop up a lot and I don't know why is Driving and more specifically handling. Personally I don't get the complaints. It's actually fairly straightforward and easy to get to grips with how vehicles handle. Especially motorbikes. I have hardly used fast travel as a result and just drove around all the time while enjoying the music.… Expand "

It seems mainly consoles suffers from this and sure it sucks, but this is the section for the PC version, which is the DEFINITIVE version of the game, so I won't take it into account. And if you actually play this game instead of going around GTA style and try to create chaos at each and every corner it works fine with only a few minor bugs or immersion breakers.  It's still easily a 10/10 game, basically Deus EX with a much better Story, more options to tweak your character and how you approach things. Everywhere is stuff to explore if you actually look for it. Gameplay is fine, except vehicle controls with mouse+kb but w.e. And the graphics are just insanely awesome. No other open world game comes even close. 10/10 doesn't mean something is absolutely flawless, as this is an unreasonable expectation since nothing can be objectively flawless. But it delivers on every front and I truly hadn't had that much fun in an open world rpg since skyrim.  Things I don't like: - Minor glitches here and there - Vehicle controls - Crafting System (I don't even think it needs crafting, or at least it should be exclusive to vendors i.e. you gather materials and tell a vendor to craft something for you) - That clothes have stats (totally unnecessary, just give em mod slots for those) - Weapon balancing needs further polishing (i.e. LMGs feel completely off) - Stealth gameplay needs further polishing (More options how you approach enemies in stealth mainly)… Expand "

You really do get immersed in it. Of The Game itself I do have a couple of Issues.. What Does break immersion is: 1: The Romances are excellent, the characters are so deep, that is true of all the main characters. But the Love interests Very much.  But once the romance story is complete they become Like normal NPC's.. They really need to fix this and soon.. 2: You get a place at the Nomads camp.. i have not found a way in yet. Judy gives you her keys But you cant use the place like your own Even though she says you can. This needs fixing,, I would move in with her or Panam (Judy is Lesbian and Panam is (Hetro) but so far you can only use your own place. 3: Cars..

I'll try to explain why.  Story - undoubtably the strongest point of the game. You probably heard it elsewhere already, it is really good, well written, the voice acting is great etc. BUT. It touches on some really heavy, existential subjects, and thus it may be uncompelling to some. It's not your typical joyful ride, it is mature, and makes you think and reflect on things. Also, the ending is somewhat vague, to fathom what has actually transpired demands patience and immersion. So, if you are someone who likes to bring justice and order to the world through your gun blazing exploits in the climax of the game, you will be disapointed. Meaning - this game is not for children - they will not understand it's premise.  Open world and RPG elements. Surprisingly, the city and your side activities feel unconvincing, at least comparing to the Witcher series. That's because most of your contracts or gigs feel trivial in comparison to your main story line. Going after those side activities sometimes just feels wrong. Also the city feels somewhat superficial. It was to be exptected, though, as the sheer size of the Night City really makes it hard to fill it with up with meaningful content. I mean, you really don't want to enter every building in the city to check for jobs or loot. People already complain about the constant reminders and messages, it would be even worse if there were no shortcuts. It is a game after all, not a simulation of an entire city.  Combat and driving. The bone of contention for some. I actually find combat very engaging and fun. The main thing with combat is that, you need to progress the story a bit and get some exp, before you can afford some cyberwear and skills. But once you do that, you can really enjoy the shootouts. To be honest I had my doubts about that side of the game, but it turned out well. Didn't try much hacking, but it is solid and can be fun as well. The driving though... It's not horrible, but I miss the open fields and meadows of the Witcher 3:) For boy, taking corners in this one is tricky as hell.  Bugs and glitches. A lot. By the time you read this some of those will be probably fixed, but they are annoying. Visually though the world looks great, at times stunning even.  Final thoughts. Before you buy this game ask yourself a question. What is it that you like in games, and what you expect out of playing them. Cyberpunk 2077 is a deep and engaging story about life, one packed in great visuals and music. It is like a movie, only ten times longer and, well, interactive. If you like mature movies then you will appreciate this game a lot. You will think about the story long after you finished it. But if you're more of an action-packed, superhero movies person, then you may find this game odd and unfulfiling. One of the reasons for the outcry after Cyberpunk launched is that it pretends to be an action game. People fall for for it, and then they are dissapointed. And that's my only gripe with this game. It tries to be many things at once. Had the designers kept it simpler, it would have been a game of a decade. In it's current state it falls short of that mantle, but it is still an excellent game.… Expand "

The game itself looks and runs fine, I haven't noticed any game breaking bugs, only few glitches here and there, nothing major and nothing that would interfere with my game, plus I'm sure those will be ironed out in a month or two. The graphics is very nice as you probably know (running on medium/high settings on my 1070 just fine). The game play itself is okay, it's 3d shooter with a mix of gta, deus ex and borderlands. The hacking and stealth aspects seem a bit underdeveloped and not very interesting so I mostly play the game as 3d shooter with occasional use of stealth or hacking which seems to work fine and what the game seems to be designed for. The crafting mechanics seem a bit pointless as after 30 hours I haven't even touched crafting yet. One aspect of the game that I dislike is the gear you get - there does not seem to be much thought put into different classes and gear sets and that sort of thing (like combat vs hacker vs stealth gear types that would promote different styles of game play) - it seems to be completely random which also makes things a bit silly. A tank top can have higher armor than armor plate carrier vest, etc. which means that most of the time you look quite stupid as you just use whatever has the highest stats, even if it makes no visual sense. None of these things are major issues though and so far the game is fine, but my next few point are big ones - the story, the characters and the quests are all not very good. The main story is not very interesting, it seems to be a classic ""taking down the system"" type story but so far it is a bit bland. The characters are also bland and uninteresting - you don't spend enough time with anyone so they just come and go and I don't care about any of them, I don't even remember their names. One slightly interesting character is Johnny Silverhand played by Keanu Reeves - he's a bit of an a-hole but at least you get to know him a bit and is at least memorable somewhat and the circumstance of our relationship (without going into spoilers) is a bit different than I expected (I'd like to point out that I knew pretty much nothing about CP2077 before playing it, I completely missed the hype train and everything which was probably a good thing). A big missed opportunity are the side quests in my opinion - they are very bland. The side quests usually revolve around killing or rescuing someone or stealing some documents from some computer. But whats the real problem is that they get none of the well crafted stories like we've seen in Witcher 3. You get most of the side missions simply by a phone call and a text message, no meeting of interesting characters, no cut scenes, no dialogs, no decisions to be made, etc. which is really disappointing. The side quests in Wither 3 were very well done, with interesting stories being told and some very memorable moments. Unfortunately in CP2077 there's none of that, that's a very big step back, the side quests are dime a dozen and forgettable, one just like the others. Overall the game is a bit of a let down. It's far from terrible as some people try to imply but it's also a big missed opportunity. Ultimately, while the game play is enjoyable enough, the game just becomes bland and boring, which I mostly attribute to uninteresting story, characters and side quests. I will probably finish the game but so far the game hasn't really hooked me. I think 6 or 7 out of 10 is fair score.… Expand "

At any point you can just walk around the different groups of people and hear incredibly diverse interactions that are congruent with exactly who the people are, where they are, and what they are doing. These are not randomly selected cookie-cutter dialogue files getting played. Frankly, the scope of effort that must have gone into every minutiae is more than my Mk. 1 Mod 0 'ganic brain can comprehend.  The realism for a future dystopian cyberpunk world is off the charts, including some more extreme stuff that is just nonchalantly located alongside more normal paraphernalia (at least, what we poor 'ganics would call normal in the year 2020 of our universe). There is a setting for censoring that stuff if you are too weak-kneed (or young) for it, but I recommend leaving it uncensored. The stuff isn't ""in your face"" like some softcore h-game, but then again it's almost more disturbing how naturally and seamlessly it fits into the world of cyberpunk. The average Night City resident would accuse me of being some old-fashioned Puritan clutching at my pearls for making such a big deal out of something so obviously normal and natural.  I am playing on a 4K monitor using a 2080 Ti and spent several hours fine tuning the settings for maximum performance at a playable framerate. This game is a real GPU-killer. For a similar setup to me, use GeForce experience to select the maximum setting, then adjust the following in game settings: disable all the cinematic effects (seriously, why do people like motion blur and DoF???) and set Ray Tracing to Medium.

Pero una vez dado por finalizado únicamente habiendo visto uno de sus múltiples finales. Tengo que decidir que la sensación final con el juego lamentablemente se resume en una mezcla agridulceEs difícil hacer un análisis de CyberPunk 2077 un mes después de su lanzamiento. Aun habiendo dedicado un total de 60 horas en completar su historia principal y realizar varias misiones secundarias. Pero una vez dado por finalizado únicamente habiendo visto uno de sus múltiples finales. Tengo que decidir que la sensación final con el juego lamentablemente se resume en una mezcla agridulce con una cierta decepción. Sin olvidar y obviamente reconociendo el gran trabajo de los desarrolladores. Cyberpunk se ha visto sufrido por las grandes presiones comerciales y económicas. Su lanzamiento caracterizado por sus cuestionables retrasos y su gran cantidad de bugs en el juego ha provocado severas críticas que en gran parte han perjudicado la imagen del juego. Pero en si esto no quiere decir que sea un mal videojuego. Es verdad que la narrativa no acompaña demasiado siendo en muchas partes algo simple y poco profunda. Pero con respecto a esto si es verdad que tanto el entorno,personajes y el múltiple contenido provoca una mejor experiencia con respecto a esta. Los problemas principales en mi opinión erradican en la incompresible progresión,  las múltiples carencias del inventario, las mecánicas absurdas como el respawn de la policía  y en muchas ocasiones la repetición de misiones y objetivos del juego. El apartado gráfico destaca por sus amplios y detallados escenarios acompañados de detalles que hacen sumergirte en la localización en la que te situas. La gran cantidad y variedad de contenido en un principio puede abrumar pero se le acaba encontrando un sentido y justificación en el juego. La acción sin destacar mucho implementa mecánicas y opciones que provocan una gran variedad de situaciones y variables a la hora de afrontar los combates. Con respecto a la dificultad e inteligencia de los enemigos pienso que está poco pulida. La única dificultad que encuentras es que no estés preparado para un cierto combate. Pero en si los enemigos no te planten situaciones con dificultad y no oponen mucha resistencia. He de destacar la variedad tanto en armas, vehículos y ropa a utilizar. Que en un gran grado ameniza y hace más llevadera la travesía por el juego. Tanto el apartado musical y actoral pienso que está bien resuelto y sin destacar muchísimo se nota un gran esfuerzo y dedicación. Más o menos todo esto quiere decir que no es justo decir que CyberPunk es un mal juego porque no lo es. Es una gran idea más o menos bien ejecutada que alberga un gran potencial pero que debido a los grandes fallos y a las malas decisiones tomadas por CD Projekt se ha visto notablemente perjudicado. Es una gran pena la verdad. Cyberpunk apuntaba muy alto y todo el mundo tenía una gran confianza en la desarrolladora que a su vez autoconvencia a los consumidores con su aclamada anterior entrega The Witcher 3. En fin a veces estas cosas pasan y más cuando se trata de hacer videojuegos una tarea que implica a muchas cosas y a mucha gente.

Doing a combination of Story content as well as a decent chunk of the side quests that littered Night City, I was able to play for about 57 hours before I decided I wanted the game to be done. Personally, I felt the main story was too short (Very short compared to TW3) and the side quests did very little to keep me engaged enough before I wanted to just know more about V's story. I personally enjoyed the story up until the ending but it fits with the narrative (I got the generic ending).  As far as the game play goes, it was pretty standard. The skilltree was extremely generic, only giving a few ""keynote"" abilities for each tree but it got the job done as far as showing progression. The weapons don't really feel different between rarities and levels. The white gun you use at level 1 will feel like the purple or orange gun you find later. SMART and TECH weapons are nothing new but did change the gameplay a bit once they were found. Exploring Night City doesn't really have any magic to it. The exploration is subpar due to the fact that you will only find some text logs and maybe some ammo, healing/buff items and some of the game's iconic weapons. There is very little to it compared to other game's that give exotic items full back stories, sometimes quests and maybe even some memorable moments while obtaining them.  The combat isn't terrible but does nothing to change the formula (Not saying that's a bad thing). The melee is just a combination of light/heavy attacks but has a few perks that can make it feel flashy at times. Shooting is pretty standard. You will hip fire or ADS and target enemy weakpoints. Put enough rounds into them while taking advantage of your perks will see most enemies taken down very quickly (on hard and lower, at least) I had no issue with the combat, personally but the skilltrees are extremely light and don't do much to really make you feel unique outside of a few key ones.  The RPG aspect feels almost non existent. There's very little choice in the game and if you are looking for massive story changing aspects, there's just too little of it. Most of your playthough will be the same except for the endings and what build you decide on. The endings are mostly based on what quests you complete and a few rare pieces of dialogue here and there. You do level up just like any normal RPG while also gaining perk points for ""mastering"" weapons/stealth etc.  (I will explain further about the 1080TI issues at the bottom) The performance is not too bad on PC if you understand your hardware limitations but the 1080TI had weird issues that I can't explain even while using up to date drivers and no temp issues. I was running the game on a Gigabyte 1080TI (However, I did have to use a mod made by Yamashi in order to get the following performance), Ryzen 5 3600, 16GB DDR4 3000Mhz with the game installed on a Samsung Evo 860 500GB. Playing at 1080p standard, 1080p ultra wide and standard 1440p netted me a solid 50-60 FPS on High with film grain and motion blur being the only settings disabled. Attempting 1440p ultrawide left me at a stable 30FPS but I did not wish to play it at that resolution for obvious reasons. I also tried playing it on my laptop which ran a 2070 max q, I7 8050H, 16GB DDR4 2666Mhz and also using an SSD. It was able to run Ultra at 1080p between 51-62 FPS but bumping it to 1440p on high left me at 48-53 FPS. I was not able to attempt ultra wide as the laptop just struggled too much.  The story was okay for me. I enjoyed what little of it there was but felt like it was just way too short. I know that CDPR said they were going to reduce the length due to people not beating TW3 but this felt insanely short. I know that the games can't really be compared as one is a third person action RPG while CP2077 is an FPS RPG but the side quests are a big issue in my opinion. TW3 had little stories with a lot of its quests where as CP2077's side content felt tacked on. There's little dialogue, no substance, and it is mainly there to give you exp and loot. You won't find out more about the world other than, ""This gang member is bad, stop them,"" Or, ""This person needs to be rescued, go save them and i'll give you good stuff."" I personally felt like this was the biggest disappointment about the game for me.  Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game but did not live up to expectations. I didn't really follow the hype as much as others but I was still looking forward to this game. I enjoy the setting, loved the tabletop game and have enjoyed all of the Witcher games as well as other RPGs, and CP2077 has felt like the weakest game I have played this year. What little there was, I enjoyed but CDPR needs to improve the game further with more content, hopefully good DLCs later and regain that magic they apparently lost during this game's development… Expand "

I'm not even going to talk about how buggy this game is and the bad performance it has, i wish those were the only issues this game has. The AI is as bad as Mafia III if not worse, If you put your bike on the side of the road with enough space for the cars to keep driving they just don't know what to do and stay still, same thing when you shoot, instead of go fast and escape, all of them get out of the vehicle at the same time and lay down like a 2006 game. The police is awful as the always respawn close to you and on your back no matter where you are, either on the middle of the street, a rooftop or a small room and when it comes to shootings they just go running or move without a clear reason, same thing with your teammates if there's any. The city is beautiful but at the same time completely empty as there's nothing you can do apart from main and side quests (you can't even change your hair) so the only thing you have left is go drving around nightcity while trying to complain about how bad the driving on this game is, the wheel turns way too much forcing you to drift and bikes are even worse, there's no way you can fall from it, no matter how fast you go, the crash or how many things you try to climb because it's physics are pretty bad. The backstory is pretty much meaningless like every choice you make in the game apart from the last mission and possible romances. The graphics are pretty good and I enjoyed the story but it's far from the things promised. You barely interact with each gang apart from 1/2 quests with each one, can't customize guns nor cars and because of the loot system it's completely wortless to buy something from a gun shop or a common shop to buy clothes as those are way too expensive and you'll end up looting something better in the next 1/2 hours. The only positive aspects of the game are the graphics, city itself (buildings and neighborhoods) and story. There's too many bad things from this game for me to say and again, I was tryng not to be hyped for this game because it looked so damned good and didn't want to be disappointed but it's just not good, it was all marketing… Expand "
HiddenGemsHunt,"Jan 10, 2021",0," It is not only that the game is a technical mess. The game is a boring loot shooter, about... nothing, i guess? The plot is not worth a dime, the RPG elements are few and far between, and gameplay loop is rather boring.  Deus Ex series, early Shin Megami Tensei series, even Shadowrun are more interesting cyberpunk materials. "

Additionally deeper into one of the quest lines their is a cinematic that forces your character to have sex with female prostitutes and culminates in your character fingering a chick while driving ending in a crash. As a gay man, being promised a game where we had personal agency and could make V ourself in the cyberpunk world, this is incredibly alarming and disapointing. Further all of the choices in game lead tot he same conclusions, their are no real choices in the game, hell it feels like theirs no superficial choices in the game ejther. You can't change your characters Appearence post creation ejther, and with the odd and bad lighting in the character creator this is a huge flaw.The bugs are horrendous and many but that should hopefully be fixed, however things like AI and patching are probably as is. Theirs also a ton of cut content in game that can still be scene and accessed that serve no function and glitch out the character in ways only a reload can fix. many areas feel completely devoid of any immersion or life with how sparse and broken the are, this is especially noticeable in the badlands and Pacifica where theirs few people to begin with and most of the time despawn so the world is quite litterally empty.Theirs a few very well written missions and bugs aside really make you enjoy the game, but they're few and far between the oceans of bad choices and poor designs… Expand "

Hochbichler,"Dec 13, 2020",7," Cyberpunk 2077 is a action role-playing game.

Cyberpunk's reception and probably also its quality was seriously affected by the pre-release events and expectations so lets start with that. The Witcher 3 was the game that put CD Project Red on the throne of video game development. The game was fantastic and is widely considered to be one of the best games of all time, if not the very best. After Witcher 3, the developers announced that they will depart from the Witcher world and focus their attention on this new big project, Cyberpunk 2077. Because of the spotless record of the CD Project Red, many gamers were understandably expecting a masterpiece to rival or even exceed the Witcher 3. Those expectations were only strengthened by the overall situation in the gaming world, where titans of the industry, such as Bioware, Blizzard and Bethesda were quickly falling from grace and into the abyss. The wait was long and the draught was almost unbearable. All that caused the expectations of Cybepunk 2077 to skyrocket to such heights, that it became clear, that no matter how good the game actually would be, it could never actually meet them. That on its own is a recipe for disaster. Plus allegations of so called crunch were voiced against the company. In my opinion, this whole business was a result of our society being so spoiled and weak, that it considers hard work as something reprehensible. The times we live in.  Anyway, the game was finally released in December 2020 and from the first minutes, it became very apparent that something is really wrong. The game was, and still is today, full of bugs, ranging from minor (visual glitches, lighting  etc.) to major game breaking (save file size limit, unable to complete certain missions etc.). That was a huge letdown and given its release date, it became clear that someone forced this unpolished and maybe even unfinished game to be released in the holiday season. This decision cannot be justified from any perspective, because even the extra money they made, were far outweighed by the unprecedented number of refunds. But the greatest loss for the company is the loss of reputation, something that will cost them very dearly in the years to come. Pity.  Now the actual game is really interesting, the design of the Night City is just amazing. Even in Witcher 3, CDPR proved that they can design a beautiful and functional city (Novigrad) and in Cyberpunk 2077, this gets even enhanced and becomes one of the coolest aspects of the game. Regarding graphics, the game can look very pretty, but at a very steep performance cost (unlike Witcher 3, which was also beautiful and yet low-spec PC friendly). The story is great, but kinda short and it becomes, specially towards the end, strangely predictable and also struggles to stay clear of certain storytelling cliches. It can also get a bit confusing, if you are not a Cyberpunk fan. I really like certain characters, of course Johnny is the best, great work by Keanu Reeves, the weird co-existence with V is done very well. Romance is kinda scarce, theoretically you have four options, but really you only have one, so that could definitely be improved. Because you are moving through a big city, you will spend a lot of time in your car. Driving feels really arcade and is riddled with a number of bugs and oversights. The smallest and yet possibly the most annoying of them is the ridiculously zoomed in minimap, which causes you to miss a lot of turns or use a regular map (which is also not very good) every ten seconds or so. There is also a lot of randomly appearing and disappearing traffic. There is a decent number of cars you can drive and own, most of them are really slow and sluggish (definitely for a year 2077, for example late in the main story you will get a very cool looking Porsche 930, which will however only do about 160 km/h, despite the fact that the real car had a maximum speed of 260 km/h way back in 1975). Specially the transmissions are very unrealistic and acting weird. The music is pretty good, not my thing really, but decent. The difficulty of the game is just another thing that is not optimized well. On harder difficulties, the first hours are really hard and on the contrary the second half of the game feels really easy regardless of talent or equipment choices. This game contains no microtransactions and little SJW, although it seems to me that, despite the pre-release trans poster hysteria, the game is trying to stay from controversy.  Pardon me for constantly comparing this game to its CDPR predecessor, but my overall feeling is that what once came easy with Witcher 3, is now toiled for in Cyberpunk 2077. Even if they fix all the bugs and oversights, this game will still not be as good as the Witcher games (Of course, that is just my opinion). But despite all that, Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot of very good moments and with a lot of polish and some strong DLCs it can absolutely become a great game. Final Verdict: 68 %… Expand "

Leaving the story behind (which is 10/10!) well gameplay isn't the best one, it's notacibly rushed, it's not terrible either (only 4 years of development; some people will say it's 8 but first 4 years were only exploration in the universe since most people were still working on The Witcher 3), the AI is not the best, but if you expect a good story it is not bad, for sandbox part is (doing side quests, exploring etc.)  And for the last thing - bugs and optimization: The game suffers from them like every game after release, especially after long crunch develompent, but I expect fixes for those problems (bug fixes and AI) so overall they won't affect my score much.

The main problem for PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 is bugs, which will be fixed with time. Witcher 3 launched in a pretty bad shape too, but was eventually polished. Sure, AI definitely could use some work. And they could make city feel more alive by adding tattoo shops, hair stylists, maybe some mini-games, etc. But that's all fixable and at least some of those things are surely coming with the promised DLCs next year.  I have a mid-range PC (GTX 1060) and I could run the game smoothly with high settings so there are clearly people here that exaggerate how unoptimized this game is. I played for ~60 hours and thoroughly enjoyed my time with the game. Objectively I'd rate it 8/10 right now (before bug fixes and DLC additions), but seeing all the disgusting review bombing I have to give it 10/10. When it's all said and done Cyberpunk 2077 will be remembered as one of the best RPGs ever made. Give it time, you'll see.… Expand "

This review is not easy to write as I am one of the fans who was deeply invested in buying this game and diving into the Cyberpunk world I’ve been a huge fan of for years. It’s almost soul crushing to go from all of the hype and excitement, reading up on backgrounds and brushing up on lore only to be left in sheer and utter disappointment.The game starts off and feels unique, but that unique and exciting feeling runs out quickly after 20 minutes. Why? It feels as though regardless of what life path you choose- it all ends the same. There is no separate story to dive into, nothing ground-breaking to explore, and no true RPG element to the life paths.The city itself was well done and the design gives off a nice cyberpunk metropolis. The lighting and sound are nice, but due to the performance level the game runs on it leave a lot to be desired.The guns, and action gameplay feels incomplete-although the crafting and gun mechanics seem well put together.Enemies feel bullet-spongey and the AI is a joke as with the rest of the games’ AI.In short-mainly because this game is such a bitter disappointment I can’t bring myself to finish this review-this game and us fans deserved far more and far better from CDPR.

The game is much fun once you get the hang of things, lots to do, and explore, a good story, not on Red Dead Redemption 2 story level of good but close in my opinion, and gameplay is so much fun, fast paced and intense with background music that makes you feel badass while in combat, the music themes in this game are so good and fit well with each parts of the story. And the ending(s), which I’ve only played through one ending as of now, and I chose to raid Arasaka tower by myself, which was very hard to do, but rewarding and made me feel like John Wick. I’m not going to spoil anything if anyone is reading this so I’ll just leave it to this, each of the endings will leave you feeling sad/empty, at least that’s how I felt. The game is fun, fast paced, and exhilarating outside of some few bugs. The only thing I don’t like about the game are the driving and fighting, outside of those, the game is fine and play able. But if you haven’t played it yet, and you’re deciding to give it a try, than I’d say go for it, don’t let others opinion on the game form your own, you might like it, you might not, it’s not as bad as people are making it out to be in my opinion(unless your still on last Gen).… Expand "

No, even Witcher 3 wasn't a good RPG. Go play any Obsidian's ""The Outer Worlds"" if you are looking for something in a similar vein. There are many problems, where do I even start. There are 3 major endings with some minor variations in how you approach them to create around 6 paths for the endings, but everything leading upto them are determined only by some of the major side quest chains. There's no permutations of different minor choices or anything of the like affecting the narrative in any shape or form except some instances. Even factions like Arasaka, the gangs, other corporations could have made for excellent faction quests changing the story but nope, they aren't here. Cyberware also feels underutilized, and offers only some variations to gameplay.  Is this a good action-adventure game? Not exactly, comparing NPC interactions, physics and various other aspects of this game if compared to a Rockstar game falls short.  I don't want to drag on this review since I am pretty lazy and don't want to write much, but if you are expecting a great narrative, characters, soundtrack, open world design, they are all here.

The game should've been released 3 to 5 years from now, it simply was not ready. My frustrations are not targeted towards the devs they were crunched to absolute disgusting levels to push out a game that wasn't nearly  ready. Sure, the game was announced 8 years ago, but it truly didn't start development until 2016 or 2017. The rushed nature and half baked feeling of is game is due to toxic management, extreme crunch, corporate greed, pressure from shareholders etc. I truly do wonder what this game would've been like had it been finished and was the game they advertised. Unfortunately it might take a couple years to be the game we all wanted it to be, until then I shall be leaving Night City until it becomes the game it was meant to be.  TLDR: There are some great moments in this game, it has a great aesthetic, deep and engaging story, well written characters, interesting lore, killer soundtrack, and a truly well detailed world. Unfortunately it is extremely unfinished, with performance issues, bugs and glitches, horrible npc AI,  and too much cut content and missing features/mechanics.

The story its self is quiet good but doesn't carry any emotion. The games combat is all weapon based and while the weapons are cool and unique, fighting isn't too exciting. the weapons just feel the same because of the friendly and enemy AI that performs worse that Call of duty. Seriously all they do is stand or duck behind cover and occasionally shoot. no getting flanked or getting pushed while your weak or the enemies running away if you throw a grenade. really disappointing. The graphics are quite good and detailed, this is only amplified by the art-style which nails the 'cyberpunk/futuristic'. The city its self feels a bit lackluster. i thought i'd be able to have conversations with random npc's just for the sake of it but no, you can't. while there isn't much to do in the city, this is completely made up for in the huge number of side quests available. the game really shines in how you can customize you character and life. You can choose what clothing, flashy car and how to optimize your body to have futuristic gadgets which make you actually do side missions to gain the cash for these things. overall expected more but still a good game to play but ONLY ON PC OR NEXT GEN CONSOLES. it is unplayable due to bugs on ps4 pro, xbox one X you name it. lacking in the dialogue department.

Ti prende e non ti lascia più vieni trasportato dalla storia in un vortice di emozioni senza fine.-Missioni secondarie: ne avrò fatte una 30ina e sono state TUTTE come delle piccole storie principali, dal salvare il tizio dal suicidio, persuandendolo a parole, a recuperare le auto, a salvare una persona, a sterminarne altre. Insomma le missioni secondarie sono tantissime e tutte sensate e ben scritte.-Grafica da urlo, non c'è nulla da dire è incredibile per un gioco IMMENSO come questo in termini di mondo e longevità della storia.-Evoluzione del personaggio con tanto di relazioni con gli altri ben strutturata e ricca di possibilità. Finalmente scegliere diverse opzioni nei dialoghi porta ad una conclusione differente. L'albero dei talenti e abilità è enorme con tantissime varierà-Cyberdeck: un ulteriore modo di personalizzare il tuo V. Ti consente di fare dalle piu svariate cose, come fare un doppio salto o arrampicarti più in fretta. O impiantarti delle armi nelle braccia. Diventare insomma una macchina da guerra.Contro:Bug: ci sono numerosi bug grafici e anche tecnici ma nulla di così grave. Possono davvero infastidire a volte ma nulla di grave o che non possa essere sistemato.Ottimizzazione: sarà che ho una 1660 con ryzen 5 3600... ma è davvero un gioco pesante, per girare a 50/60 fps è necessario mettere i settaggi a medio/basso. Questo è comunque un gioco dove non dai troppo peso agli fps però ritengo che sarebbe carino poterlo giocare fluido a 60 fps almeno in grafica alta senza dover spendere 600 euro per una scheda video.In conclusione ero davvero combattuto se dare un 8 o un 9 ma ritengo comunque di dover premiare cd project e questo giocone che non è un capolavoro ma è comunque un must have.

It takes you and never leaves you, you are transported by history in an endless vortex of emotions. - Secondary missions: I will have done about 30 and they were ALL like little main stories, from saving the guy from suicide, persuading him in words, to recover cars, to save one person, to exterminate others. In short, the secondary missions are many and all sensible and well written.-Awesome graphics, nothing to say is incredible for a HUGE game like this in terms of world and longevity of the story. -Evolution of the character with a lot of relationships with others well structured and full of possibilities. Finally choosing different options in the dialogues leads to a different conclusion. The tree of talents and skills is huge with so many will vary-Cyberdeck: another way to personalize your V. It allows you to do a variety of things, like double jump or climb faster. Or implant weapons in your arms. In short, becoming a war machine.Contros-Bugs: there are numerous graphic and also technical bugs but nothing so serious. They can really annoy at times but nothing serious or that can't be fixed. -Optimization: maybe I have a 1660 with ryzen 5 3600 ... but it's really a heavy game, to run at 50/60 fps it is necessary to set the settings to medium / low. This is still a game where you don't give too much weight to the fps but I think it would be nice to be able to play it smoothly at 60 fps at least in high graphics without having to spend 600 euros for a video card.In conclusion, I was really torn whether to give an 8 or a 9 but I still think I have to reward the cd project and this big game which is not a masterpiece but is still a must have.

Don’t pay too much attention to the 0-3  reviews, at time of writing less than 11% of players even hit the prologue achievement. I run it on on 1770ti laptop and it runs at about 40 fps @ ultra no raytracing. Super acceptable for my tastes.At the time of writing I have played 30 hours on steam, focusing largely on open world content.Combat Systems: 8/10 The gameplay systems in cp2077 are super robust. The leveling system allows for interesting gameplay choices that both world traversal and combat strategy. Melee can be floaty, and encourages spamming, but it feels visceral. Shooting starts slow but is excellent once you grasp the systems. Stealth sucks, but stealth sucks outside of dedicated games. That simple. Hacking is my favorite gameplay system. Initially confusing but both remote hacks and quick hacks provide fun traps to set, impressive crowd control, and substantial burst damage. Being a cyberwizard is great.Driving: 7/10The driving in the game needs tuning. It’s important to note that your starting car is garbage, replace it ASAP. The motorcycles feel great though. The car designs and sounds are gorgeous. Overall however, the cars are to hard to control and the driving minimal needs to be zoomed out so you don’t miss turns as often. Driving should feel painless, unfortunately it often turns you into the DUI maniac murderer of night city.Enemy Combat: 6/10 - 8/10 (if AI fixed)This is an unfortunate hit for the game. The enemy design is great, with different enemy kits putting stress on pretty much any strategy you adopt. From katana wielding ninjas and grenades flushing you out of cover, to snipers and enemy net runners punishing long range approaches, and high damage riflemen discouraging run and gun, when the enemy AI holds together it provides a challenge.Enemy health is high, but animations add responsiveness and staggers and stubs from weapons add to combat flow. The problem here is with a bug that causes enemy AI to drop out of combat. Super anticlimactic and frustrating, and it happens often. This should be a top priority fix.RPG Systems: 8/10The choice in the game is often only shifts dialogue rather than outcomes, however there are quests that react to your choices that feel potentially impactful. Some quests can be failed as well which is fun. The rpg elements in terms of character builds are excellent. Make sure to save up and buy cyberwear, it changes combat dramatically. The cash economy in this game is fantastic, it is slow to earn Eurodollars for upgrades, quests, and cars without being a soul crushing grind. I love the balance here.Design: 10/10The visual and audio design are incredible. Best in the industry. Artful. Character designs are unique. Interiors individually decorated, exteriors breathtaking. The soundtrack absolutely slaps. At times emotionally moving, others blood pumping. Unique dirty synth tracks for each enemy faction add intensity and a unique feel to each fight.Open world: 9/10The level and map design is incredible. The twisting and layered streets of night city are full of surprises and conflicts. I think many have noticed the lack of rdr2 style open world events and attribute the world feeling dead for this. In the game you have to look for content by following up on gigs and NCPD events. When you do, you find the world is packed with content that is all individually designed and often has chains of quests and events. The open world content is more in the Ubisoft style where you go to map icons. Unlike Ubisoft games however, the content is actually quite interesting.Mini games: 0/10There just aren’t any. Don’t personally care for them though. What I would desperately like to see are more simulation style events such as sitting at the bar, playing music, playing pachinko machines, etc...Quest Content: 10/10Broken into main/side quests, gigs, ncpd Main/side: incredible writing, human characters, crazy set pieces. Functionally excellent as a stand alone action game. Side quests are at the same quality as main missions often.Gigs: Open World quests that are way more interesting than expected. Always include a bite of story or world building. Sometimes even dramatic surprises.NCPD: The most open world style of quests. These have less story but interesting level design adds variety. Much more engaging than typical bandit camps due to level traversal and enemy placement.Philosophy: Some criticism has said the game is without philosophy. If you take the time to read the written content in game, the struggle between tech and labor, growth of AI sentience, distorted politics and advertisement, and the struggle between ambition and risk all add tension and mystery.… Expand "

I believe CDPR will fine-tune the game as they have with the witcher (a game I replay to this day).  While I am upset they are getting such a bad rap for the bugs it's needless to say if no one complained they probably would have left the game as is.   The game is a delight and a very fun time.  Nowhere else will you see an RPG that includes, FPS, detailed and non repetitive missions , side missions and gigs, platforming, exploring, challenges, easter eggs, comic relief, drama, suspense, thrill and much more the way this game does it!… Expand "

For PC I'd say it's a 9/10 or a high 8/10, and for console it's a high 7- close to a 8 depending on your generation of console; For example, Xbox One S generation faces a low 7/10 for some major graphical and overall performance issues. Again, all patch-able, but not good for a three delayed start of an launch for a game like CP77.In conclusion, this is a beautiful game that was obviously developed with an overwhelming of passion for this fictional dystopian future world of Cyberpunk 2077. If you're looking to be whatever you want in a Bladerunner esque future and possibly **** up ya mind by taking your character down a Lawnmower Man path, or be a Hitman kinda guy; whoever it is that you desire to be, CP77 has it for you. You'll have a blast even with the inconveniences that are there in it's launch.I hope you enjoy this game if you have it already or when you do pick it up; There is plenty more to discuss about, but I believe I put together what there is to basically expect from its launch version.

Так вот, если судить эту игру без учета багов, то игра точно гораздо выше среднего, сюжет, побочные квесты(хоть и не все), графика ( консоли RIP, ну и это понятно столько источников света, нпс, объектов, вертикальность, что можно было ждать от железа 2013 года), геймплей. Минусы --- 1. Для меня как игрока, который прошел все части Ведьмака, а в Ведьмак 3 так вообще наиграл 400 часов, то это урезанный сюжет по длительности, и то, что его можно пробежать игнорируя побочные квесты, что я по не знанию сделал, прошел 80% сюжета, не пройдя и 30% побочек, т.к я привык, что в Ведьмаке тебя не пустят по уровню дальше в сюжет, если ты не проходишь побочные квесты, заказы и повышаешь этим уровень ( я играю на максимальной сложности). 2. Максимальная сложность не дает тебе вызова, как выше написал, я практически прошел игру по сюжету не имея нормальной прокачки и имплантов (были только те, которые дают по сюжету) и не чувствовая сложности. 3.Баги, лично у меня их было мало( в основном зависание объектов в воздухе), но увидев, что твориться у других  людей понял, что игра сырая. Стоит заметить, что в игре нету критических багов, которые не дают тебе играть, только не серьезные. Плюсы+++ Каждый для себя их выделит сам, тк стрельба, вождение довольно казуальное, что для кого-то минус, а для кого-то плюс, тоже самое и про все в игре, что-то может не понравиться, но другому зайдет. Но графика на пк, даже на средних очень даже радует глаз (ожидал мыло, но получил, картинку, которая радует глаз), а посмотрев как игра выглядит на ультра настройках, так вообще в экстаз ушел. Вывод: Не считая багов, игра очень хорошая, мне понравилось провести в Найт-Сити время. Киберпанк 2077 не смог сделать революции как Ведьмак 3, но CDPR попытались, и как по мне получилось очень даже хорошая игра, так еще в редком сэтинге. 8.5/10 (Без учета багов, я уверен, что игру исправят, а поэтому снижать оценку из-за этого не вижу смысла).… Expand "

Moving from one area to another wonderfully illustrates the unique architecture and feel in the various districts of Night City, I've marvelled at the skyscrapers in the centre of the city as well as the Badlands and Night Cities unique take on 'Suburbia' in the south of the map on 6th street gang territory. There really is vertically, with hidden communities / tunnels and even a park under the freeways. However while the city is built to look fantastic and is a pleasure to drive around, the immersion falls away as soon as you try talking to an NPC especially the 100's running market stalls none of which can sell anything to your player.  NPC's AI is one of the most problematic parts of the game. While bugs are fixable, NPC behaviour is beyond bugged. It feels like there never was a system in place to realise CDPR's promise that; 'There will be over 1,000 Cyberpunk 2077 NPCs with hand-built daily routines.' NPC behaviour is simply atrocious on every level. NONE engage in any real conversation with your character, they have 1 canned lined which they repeat regardless of how you're interacting with them. They all behave in the exact same way when shot, carjacked or bumped into; they crouch on the ground with their hands over their heads. GTA III's NPC AI is far better, same with the Outer Worlds (a game which was consistently advertised as a lower budget title and overdelivered, Cyberpunk frequently feels like AA game of a similar level)  Scripted interactions with characters are handled far better, but those are mostly limited to main story missions and even then, many interactions with the people giving you missions are done over the phone. Your phone is constantly ringing you, can't refuse calls, its not an effective way of building up fixers (side mission givers) into effective characters and is overwhelming. You get a message every time a car comes up for sale, they could have cut down on this with an online car dealer like GTA.  The actual script and story of the game IMO is far better and original than most AAA game offerings, though character dialogue is too reliant on swearing with a kind of 'dude-bro' 90's jock vibe, the game doesn't find it's voice nearly as well as The Witcher 3 or RDR2 did. And while the story is good and solid, I ranked it about level with that of the Outer Worlds and below that of Red Dead Redemption 2.  Most story missions are well designed and fun, the beginning of the game (I played as a Nomad) was particularly impressive, that being the time you're in a limited area without many choices to make, the more freedom the game gives you the more immersion falls to the side. One of the most disappointing moments in the game was about an hour in, you move to night city with your buddy. A 2 minute cutscene plays that was heavily used in advertising material, as it played and I recognised scene after scene I realised all these moments were only in the cutscene and I would never be able to 'play' these experiences.  Furthermore, no animations exist for eating, drinking or getting body mods. The examples of this in marketing are from cutscenes. The amount of footage I recognised from marketing in the early game is incredibly demoralising, the ads were literally the cutscenes, not gameplay.  I haven't even mentioned the bugs, I experienced one game-breaking bug in my 25 hours of play so far and an uncountable number of other bugs on PC.  In conclusion Cyberpunk 2077 gives us a fantastic looking world with terrible interactivity within that world. A good story with some interesting characters, interesting missions, some with several possible paths but which largely offer an allusion of choice with very few of your decisions leading down a different path (with a few notable exceptions). It forces so many compromises on the player that I can't recommend it. If you're looking for something to play you will be better served by; The Outer Worlds, RDR2 (my favourite game ever, a truly complete western experience) Control, Bioshock Remastered and even indie cyberpunk titles like Cloudpunk and Ghostrunner offer more polished gameplay within their limited worlds. Cyberpunk needs more than bug fixing, it needs to implement NPC AI, eating drinking animations, market stand interactivity, collision mechanics, a more in depth character creator (play as anyone! As long as they're 6 ft and have a 6 pack...), mid game character editing (you better love that hair cuz ya can't change it) and much much more. This is a bad game with the potential to be a good game after a year of patches but I don't see it ever being an amazing game. There’re loads of bugs, but beyond that there's a lack of depth to the world that I don't think can be patched in. The best thing Cyberpunk did was it taught me a very hard lesson; DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE.… Expand "

Increasingly, the world seems like a huge dumpster fire, which puts more importance on the idea of escapism. Video games give people the power to create new worlds, ones where people can lose themselves in, with new technology we have the ability and opportunity to create things that we could only dream of when children.  But somehow, somewhere along the way, we forgot what it meant to build things of quality and to do business with integrity, to serve with quality, to be proud in ones work and in ones creation.  This game is the metaphorical cherry on the top of the steaming pile of crap bags that has been 2020.  The gut wrenching disappointment was actually upsetting. I had my car stolen last year, and somehow buying Cyberpunk 2077  was worse, whoever stole my car, maybe needed the money, was in a tight spot, and was just stealing my car, not lying for years and months before hand, convincingly enough to get me excited, to then just rob me.

Nor should you expect any good performance on a console, since they cant handle 50% of newly released titles nowaday. I had hoped for a little more badass combat like that in Assasins creed since that is best suited for melee combat of the game. But the current combat is worked out.  9/10 - Don't like the gunplay, feels a bit reminiscent of an FPS shooter.… Expand "
Dysilik,"Dec 12, 2020",9," Skip the old gen consoles, wait for Ps5/Xbox Series versions or play it on PC. The game will be better in a year, but some things won't change (A.I and Driving for exemple). Still it offers things that I have never seen in any other game, the time fly when you play. It's a great game, just not the revolution you were hoping for. "
Chjggh,"Dec 12, 2020",3," This game is definitely not worth the price point for me. The story is cool and all but I personally don't find it very replayable in anyway.

As an open world game it felt like it had very little to offer other than the main story lines and tons of side quests. (Some sides quests are really fun tho tbh)  What I meant is as an open world game for example when we play games like GTA (as a whole franchise, not just any specific GTA game) there are tons of fun stuff to do other than doing quests, as an open world rpg fan I have spent tons of times exploring Skyrim and Oblivion even after finishing the main quest line. Even not so successful first Watch Dogs game has many good things as an open world game. There are fun arcade mini games, random events, poker games stuff like that. Even CDPR's Witcher 3 had gwent, which was really fun, I have spent hours roaming all over the Witcher 3 map to find new npcs to challenge and collect new cards like many other players. But for Cyberpunk I didn't find anything that than can suck me into the vast open world that they have created, not too many place of interest in this game. Specific pubs and stuff only available for players and there is nothing to do even if you go there, so no point going there other than questing.  NPC AI is non-existent, even oblivion ai looks far better to me compared to the npcs' of night city. At least they would start random conversation among them which was and still is great meme materials. If you attack them some might run but others will attack you back. Even old games like GTA San Andreas npcs' react in some way when you hit their car or themselves, or when you try to rob their car for your quick ride. To me it felt like they put these npcs to just fill the void of night city.  Crafting didn't feel like that alluring to me either. I remember I spent hours collecting all the diagram of armors and weapons in Witcher 3. The whole process was fun and rewarding at the same time. But here I did not feel the need at all and finished the whole game with what ever the drop I got from enemies or missions.  Cyber upgrades are also not that charming either, there are some good upgrades and help you become strong but I started upgrading them pretty late in the game and didn't feel it was mandatory in early game while you can feel how important augmentation in Deus Ex game.  And more than that is there anything unique or new this game offers? This game looked like a blend of many games to me. Games like - Remember Me, GTA, Watch Dogs, Deus Ex, Fallout etc. But I didn't find anything so that I can say, ""Oh this is Cyberpunky"" when I play other games like I said when I saw those cyber upgrades ""Oh this is Deus Exy"" or when I saw brainstorming I said ""oh this is so Remember Me ish""  Other than bugs and glitches I don't think these problems will go away. Bugs can be fixed and cdpr looked determined to fix them with several hot fixes, which is good. So I will take it as a story telling games, once the story is done the game is done kind of game. Won't count this as a long term playing rpg like Skyrim or anything or just for having fun doing stuff on open world kind of game like Just Cause. This game could have been the best game of decade, it really had the potential but with these many flaws it is just another game, play, enjoy till the main story ends, uninstall.  Only reason I gave it 6 ratings is because of the story. I enjoyed it. The character build up is also good. At least that much is expected from cdpr and they did not ruin it on this part. I do not care about console, so no reason to give it 0 for console gamers' sake.

Of those 50hours, I probably averaged 1bug ever minute, had several game breaking bugs, and had to reload my game almost every single mission, sometimes multiple time, but this review and rating will be excluding every bug and performance problems that I had an focus on the gameplay itself. So lets begin and start with the Pros: first off I want to say many of the characters had the best voice acting I have ever heard and just make me fall in love with their story arch wishing I could do more mission with them. Next up has got to be the game beauty, even with ray tracing off and medium setting the game was quite beautiful. The last good thing has got to be the certain side missions and the first few main mission you will do, They are laid out beautifully and absolutely amazing. The story with judy and panam/aldocados has some of the best writing and voice acting and left me wanting more from their story. I was extremely disappointed that they were so short for such important game characters. This is about it for the Pros so next here comes the Cons. First up we got the mediocre driving and melee combat, while gunplay wasn't good I certainly wasn't terrible either. Next we have the AI, which is sadly some of the worst AI I have ever seen. Turn away for 2sec, and you've got a whole new npc and car on the street. Anytime you look away it completely reloads the npcs/object. Often they will even just appear or disappear in front  of you. And the police AI is terrible, kill someone accidentally they spawn behind you, no time to react or hide, they just keep spawning behind you the minute you do something. The AI cars are also terribly designed andif you block a road they'll just stop never going around you, and sometimes they'll even stop in the middle of an intersection because the light turned red. This is just the beginning if the issues of the AI but it really ruins the experience, and you could talk about it for hours so ill move on the the story. The storyline is bad atthe beginning, in fact it's good, but after first major part end and the second begins it just gets mediocre, then at the end, after everything the story just feels forced and no matter what you choose you'll die eventually because they decide to just say ""you took to many meds"" it just seems forced like they did that just to make it more emotional. The ending are terrible snd there no way to really choose a different ending cause they all end just the same way on a basic level. The ending is joy affected by the choices you make either, which is really disappointing considering CDPR advertised it that the choices you made would impact the story and ending. Same goes for the rest of the story it's basically yes, Ahole yes, or [lifepath] yes theres no real consequences or different choices. It's very disappointing. The fact that CDPR advertised this an rpg and then changed it at the last sec to a action fps is very troubling and deserving of a law suit in my opinion. The gameplay itself is rather boring and unless your doing a main side mission or the main story line it's stupidly boring. The other thing that really pissed me off is that if you decide to finish the main story, you're done, that's it, The only way to continue playing is the go back to the last save and never finish the last mission. This is beyond idiotic and really ruins the want to continue playing. RDR2 has a great way of doing their ending where you become a new character and it would allow you to continue playing. I also set them up for possible dlc in-the future. The way cyberpunk is, it makes it nearly impossible for future dlc and if there ever way it would be so short because there are so many options and it would be so expensive. Last few things ill mention is that there is that the romance and relations are so damn short for something they pushed so damn hard. The Lifepaths make no difference except for the first 20min. The city is feels lifeless with the AI issues and there no way to changes you appearance. For a game so far in the future with so much cybernetics, technology, and plastic surgery, you can even change you're damn hair style. Adding on to this the customization of you characters is pitiful and is one of the worst I have ever played. Last I just say that for a game that was and is supposed to be filled with sex and drugs, It feels like your in a strict religious family. The cities full of adverts about BD sex, prostitution, drugs, ect but at the same time you only get 2 npc prostitutes?? On top of this they pushed this game like the romance and relationships would be crazy, when im reality you get 3options and the actual relationship is only for like 1 or two missions. I could go on and on but it seems ive run out of characters to use, so ill leave it at this. Don't buy it mot worth $60… Expand "

leewells2000,"Dec 12, 2020",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          REVIEW FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS COMPLETED THE GAME TWICE  The story is low quality, the gameplay is low quality.  The only thing that is high quality is the graphics.  The gameplay is broken and unbalanced.  Aim-Bot firearms do double the DPS of weapons that require real player skill to operate.  Also the RNG makes everything a lottery including the weapons you find at vendors and their blueprints.  There are many other bugs that range from annoying to ""I have to reload back to the autosave"".  But what really irked me was that 80% of this game is ""driving"" and being forced to do uninteresting, useless ""gigs"" by having a ""Quest Lockout"" timer running (the feature, ""wait for 'so and so' to call back"" to proceed).  That leads to the story.  The professional critics seem to almost miss this likely from being paid to do so because I can't see that they are that ignorant with the tell-tell lockouts above.  The story is incredibly short. If you can hack out the timers (trainers that allow you to increase game time progression), you can complete the best ending for this game in 6 hours.  That's far less than the touted 40 hours promised.  And besides, 70% of this game is ""driving"".  As a result the character depth is very shallow for everyone character but one and he's the most universally hated character (a terrorist).  After datamining the game there was about 42 minutes of dialogue from this character, and less than that total from all other characters (yeah combined).  Players are complaining that they don't know any of the characters in the game before they're just thrown into the pot and stirred. This is because of a catastrophic ""time laps"" that they throw in right in the introduction.  Secondly the player's romantic partner seems almost inhuman.  While you have less than 8 minutes of dialogue with them, there is a point where you seal the deal with them (a very short romantic scene) and then you drop the bomb that ""I'm dying"" and you get a response like this, ""Good luck solving that problem.  Have fun!""  The narcissism it took to write those lines and not understand that two people who love each other simply don't behave that way is befuddling (if my wife told me she was going to die in 2 weeks, I wouldn't let her out of my sight).  And the game is full of these irregularities.  But it's not because it was just a simple mistake, it's because the story was literally half-written.  All in all, this game gets a solid 3 from me.  The only thing that makes this game worth your time is simply enjoying the graphics.  Nothing else is noteworthy.… Expand "

And now finally lets get to the game itself - the art style, character models, world details, music and mainly story and atmosphere are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The surreal situations during quests in which you find yourself in, the witty, funny and sometimes pretty dark dialogues of NPC that you happen to overhear are exactly what makes this a strong title. Cruising around on a motorbike listening to industrial techno on the radio while watching the day/night cycle change the feel of the city, stumbling upon some crazy side-quest hunting cyber-psychos, seeing the eyes of characters light-up with that ""Blade Runner owl glimmer"" when receiving data, having a deep conversation with a cyber hooker, Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand and sooo much more cool stuff is really what makes this game what it is. What makes me really sad is the situation around the old consoles - yes the game is buggy and CD Projekt Red underestimated how hard it will be to port a next-gen game to old-gen hardware but honestly it seems they got pushed into this instead of just releasing in stages (PC first/next-gen consoles first, old gen later once optimized).

A SLAP IN THE FACE to everyone who didn't want to play this game yet since not only is it good and gorgeous, it's not THAT buggy. (there, my Jim Sterling cameo is assured)  Damn well close to perfect if you're into open world games and like cyberpunk/sci-fi themes. At times you forget the game world is based on a tabletop released in the 1990s.  Small idiosyncrasies, such as radio and tv stations, or the very weak 'net' can occasionally throw you off and feel outdated, but again; this is not our reality's future, this is cyberpunk; it needs reminding since at times the two feel so intertwined at times they become a blur.  The story is also pretty good, as far as i've gotten; a bit predictable (or maybe it's the spoilers in gameplay previews), but what really impresses is not the overall character arch that you embark on, but the other characters you encounter, their emotions and struggles. The animation for main quest characters (and some side-quest ones) are very well done. At times it not only sounds but also looks like a real human being you're talking to.  And yes, the visuals are stunning. I was blessed with a GTX upgrade before the release, and if you were on the fence for this i highly recommend upgrading. I was blown away by the looks of the game; then again this was also a pretty big leap for me in hardware. Even if you're not into graphics though an upgrade might be required, as it seems to be a pretty big hog. Don't expect this to run smooth or look good on older hardware.  The game is also more on the buggy side of things but honestly nothing horrible. Major bugs encountered i could count on one hand. The most you will encounter are visual glitches and UI bugs and I never had to reload a save because of a bug. Hell GTA Online feels buggier than this (with it's recursive loading bs).  The side missions can get a bit repetitive and the map is hard to follow at times. I also don't like how close the minimap feels when you're driving and often times i've missed a turn because i was just too fast and didn't see it. A zoomed out minimap when driving feels like a must. The existance of stats on gear also means that how i want to look and how i actually look are two different things entirely. So it's not an ultra-perfect experience,  but honestly it comes damn close for myself.… Expand "

Alfr,"Dec 13, 2020",9," I have 46 hours played in 3.5 days - took Friday off work to play this game.

You have to ask yourself: ""Compared to what?""  Pros:  - Characters are great - some I like,I have 46 hours played in 3.5 days - took Friday off work to play this game. I have enjoyed a lot of great RPGs (Witcher, Divinity, Wasteland, GTA, etc), but this is the first in a long time that's got me so excited I'm thinking about it all day and driving home to get 20 minutes in on lunch.... You have to ask yourself: ""Compared to what?""  Pros: - Characters are great - some I like, some I don't - as it should be. Their reactions to conversation options are neat, and the facial expressions are great, very realistic, whether it be skepticism, smugness, hopefulness, you name it. - The story is as good as you'd hope from CDPR. It's got a few wild moments, but it's not goofy like GTA. There are truly sad moments, edgy parts, and you can choose to hang out with people or not depending on how you feel about them. - There are somewhere north of 200 perks to invest in, under 11 skill trees. This offers a larger than usual degree of specialization, and promotes you investing in a playstyle that will be very different from the next guy's. For example, I have spec'd into crafting and engineering. My best gun is legendary quality, and I can afford to keep upgrading it as my level increases. My tech weapons and grenades are great, but I'm slow, bad in melee, and can't hack worth a damn. - The performance is great on my expensive set-up (EVGA Geforce RTX 3090 FTW3 Ultra, ASUS PG279Q, i7-8700K, Samsung 860 Pro SSD). I run all ultra, RTX, DLSS on, at 50 - 80 FPS, depending on what's being processed. It looks so good I keep taking screenshots to share with friends. - As you level up and get better gear, you really feel like you're making it somewhere. Driving is way better with better cars, fighting is way better when you've specialized well, etc. - The hardest difficulty is tough enough to kill you plenty, but never impossible, and never so bad you don't want to try again.  Cons: - The AI driving really needs work. You'll hear brakes screeching when you shouldn't when an AI is driving you around, and it's generally clunky and disjointed. That said, this is an RPG, not a racing game, and your own driving is just fine. - There are a fair number of bugs, but nothing gamebreaking. I have had a few conversations where the voice sounded wrong, like talking in a cave when I'm in a car. I've seen a quick t-pose here or there, and a few times characters' mouths don't move. I've also had my gun not be able to shoot while ADS (until saving/reloading the game). All these will be fixed.… Expand "

Also, the impactful decision-making system lets you fully customize the experience you have with cyberpunk. Of course, I had some minor bugs, but nothing that couldn't be fixed with a quick reload. Furthermore, the characters have brilliant voice actors and dialogues Overall, the game is just like a playable movie, which is why I appreciate the decision to publish the online version as a whole separate game. However, if you expect a grindful game that makes you chase after small pieces of the story, you should look somewhere else. Cyberpunk doesn't give you less of a main story, but rather leaves out all the unnecessary unrelated parts you may find in games such as Assassins Creed. The game lets you live a part of the life of the main character ""V"" and you don't go drifting off leveling up your gear until you finally reach the necessary level to progress in the story. Nonetheless, if you like this kind of game, you can grind for the best equipment in Cyberpunk. I however played 2 character side-quest lines (which can potentially end up in a romance depending on your gender) which were absolutely stunning and made for a playtime of 28 hours. But one word of advice for you, if you should decide to buy the game: If you don't mind spoilers, have a look at the possible endings and how you have to play to reach one (I would recommend the Panam ending - you'll know what that means if you play the game). Every ending you can achieve in Cyberpunk is, just like the world of Cyberpunk, in one way or another depressive.… Expand "

Toom0C,"Dec 13, 2020",0," I wouldn't have minded if the game just had a few problems with the visuals, the biggest problem is how superficial the entire game is.

Far from theI understand this game is getting a lot of negative attention from players experiencing 'near-constant crashes, bugs, glitches' and the like, with many of these sources playing on high-end PC's and PS5's. I've been playing for about a week on my basic-b PS4 and while I acknowledge my experience is not always going to be universal, this game has been absolutely breathtaking. Far from the reports of the console version being 'unplayable', my time in Night City has been almost completely without bugs of any kind. The game will crash out on average once a day, and that's with about 6 hrs of play (far from constant), and since I'm in the habit of quicksaving often it's no sweat off my back. (Also worth noting my internet is very average.) So yes anecdotally I'd say the reports of an unplayable game are unfounded and exaggerated. As for the gameplay etc? Love it. I'm usually bad at first-person shooters, but I've found the combat fun and innovative and varied (I like my sniper & quickhacks & stealth personally, but am not above laying waste to thugs with brute force). The character creation is quite in-depth and the clothes you pick up along the way keep you feeling fresh (so satisfying to get those Legendary threads!). The real star of the show however is Night City itself. Endlessly explorable, whether hoofing it or climbing up and over or blazing thru the streets on a future-chopper. Always new and evolving landscapes and neighborhoods bustling with action and opportunities for trouble or riches, or both. The world of Night City is an absolutely stunning work of art; the tireless hours put into this fully-realized megalopolis simply cannot, for me, be brushed aside or dismissed. This game is the real deal. Again I realize my experience is not everyone's, but if I can get so much pure fun and satisfaction out of this sprawling game on just a very basic ps4 and internet connection, I'd urge you to consider cutting thru all the negative chatter out there and just experience this amazing game for yourself.… Expand "

Character customisation is pathetically limited... i've seen free to play games that have more thought about the character put into it than this does sadly. The 'cyberwear' you get to chose in character creation is 14 transparent images that go over your face and basically act like tattoos.  They could have done something truly amazing with cybernetic arms, legs, and really brought it to a whole new level... but it all got completely ignored and replaced with a 'cookie cutter' creation system that's not even as in depth as 90% of free to play MMORPG's out there online  The storyline is great, the voice acting is amazing, and the design of the city and layout are truly something fresh and new... it's just the RPG side of it that is seriously being let down... treat it as a standard action / FPS game with story and you're fine...

Absolutely beautiful and has a wonderful story to lead you through it and enough side quests to keep you distracted for hours. There are occasional graphical glitches. I didn't experience any kind of crash or game-breaking bug. Just the occasional floating phone or overlapping subtitle.  Don't expect to hit Ultra and be able to play the game at 60 FPS. It's built for future hardware. A lot like MS Flight Sim or any other AAA game heavily reliant on immersion.  Like Witcher 3, the game has about a 10h prologue. More if you get wrapped up in sidequests, less if you blitz. Once that passes though the game opens up and you are free to explore all the back alleys and ripper shops around town. Your choices DO matter. If you're expecting Jarvis level AI to call you up for a drink than you need to lower your expectations, if Google home can't do it, neither can a game's AI. But characters do tailor their responses to your actions and you can entirely expand or fridge NPCs depending on how you interacted with them and your environment.  Combat can take many paths and synergies can be set up effectively between each type. Personally I'm enjoying a Netrunner style but melee, stealth, and shooter styles are all there and fun. It seems a lot of user reviewers really had their expectations set to something ridiculous. Cyberpunk is an excellent game and easily one of the best RPGs out there. But it's not game changing. And that's okay. As an aside: it was discussed as a possible project before Witcher 3, but Cyberpunk has been in earnest development for around 4 years starting after Witcher 3's final DLC was released. Not the 8 that's floating around, not that development time should really matter. We didn't pay them for the game X number of years ago so they owed us nothing on a schedule. A reviewer's impatience should not be a slight against a developer. And note that any reviewer that didn't stick around the finish the prologue didn't actually experience the game. It's a 50-100h playtime game with many different endings.  As for the PS4 and Xbox One problems. It should never have been released on 7 year old consoles with potatoes for hardware. That's a big mistake by CDPR and further shows the problem with consoles lagging FAR behind PC yet having silly long life cycles. I honestly believe Cyberpunk would have been a better game had it focused solely on PC and Next Gen console platforms.  Unfortunately, CDPR put themselves in a console bind and it'll hurt their rep over an otherwise great game. If you're on PC - get it. Enjoy it. And ignore the obsolete consoles crying foul. They'll hopefully get their refund and we can go back to flatlining scavs!… Expand "

Many complain about the lack of a police system or AI driving but this is not a GTA game. I would not want it to be one personally. This game is all about story, characters and feelings. That is what I am looking for in a game, so for me it is a 10!… Expand "

Approximately a half of them hasn’t got a regret about the purchase and a great deal of time, which they spent on Cyberpunk 2077. While others have a similar opinion to mine. Let me explain it.The first and the main thing is an among of bugs, such as unprocessed textures, getting objects stuck in walls, etc.. All this little bugs spoiled my expectations and the desire to replay the game several times. Moreover, CD Projekt RED spent 8 years(they announced it in 2012) and 120 million $ on the new Cyberpunk, postponed the coming out of the game 3 times and didn’t prevent bugs which the cheaper games have. Talking about physics, I cannot not to mention car mechanics. I replayed FarCry 3 several weeks ago and the way that cars move, they move very clumsy, is the same as in Cyberpunk 2077. By the way, FarCry 3 came out in 2012. Summing up, CyberPunk 2077 is so overrated due to the immense amount of time of waiting of the release. I mean, people had been looking forward to it for 8 years and thay cannot say, that it is bad due to their desire to justify the time, that spent waiting for this game. It was considered to be the best game in 2020-2021, but the CyberPunk did not meet the expectations of more than 60% of gamers.My rate will be 5/10.… Expand "

The story is interesting and original. The characters are well written and multi-faceted. The world is vast and fun to explore. The combat is satisfying. The soundtrack is fitting, albeit the ads might be a little too wacky. The game is beautiful even on low settings, and the game never drags on. Main story missions can have branches of them as side missions that can come back and effect the main story later on. There are plenty of little easter eggs and details in the world to find (Do you know how to use the 3 shells?). Augmenting your body is fun and really helps the world feel like the cyber future. I have almost 40 hours played and I'm still in Act 2. I haven't had this much fun exploring a game since Yakuza 0.  But of course, you can't discuss Cyberpunk 2077 without the bad. The game is flat out, full stop, unfinished. I personally have not found or experienced any game breaking bugs, but I realize I've been lucky. Late rendered textures, empty streets, cars disappearing. My character was glitched into a crouch once. I was bugged into a never ending ""heart attack"" twice. Reported blue screens, poor framerates, and of course the console launch. The voice acting is hit or miss sometimes, with Keanu showing why John Wick and Neo are his best roles. At one point they left in a filler voice line with a completely different woman in the middle of a speech section. There are no consequences for going on a rampage. You could slaughter 50 civilians, drive 300 feet, and police forgot you. There isn't much variety in the loot you can find, with only about 20 total guns in the game (That I can tell). Driving on mouse and keyboard is awful. Idk if it's much better with a controller, but driving feels like every road is an ice sheet, and your brakes are mostly a suggestion.  C77 was released 6-12 months too early. I see the vision, and I love everything that makes C77 what it is. Every mission is interesting, every side mission is engaging. The story branches with your decisions, and given another solid year of development we would be discussing an instant classic video game. Right now I see a 10/10 game with 5/10 polish. 7/10 right now, but I am very interested in what this game looks like 5 months from now.  Do I suggest C77? Yes, but understand you're getting a AAA game in what feels like a late Beta. I love it for what it is, but I overlook a lot of small bugs. I can see past them, but to others they might be death by a thousand cuts.  I would gladly lay down my life for Panam Palmer.

Story:---- The Story of Cyberpunk 2077 was marketed as an RPG where your choices and lifepaths had a major difference in how your game will progress but what I played was the exact opposite the lifepaths had little to no effect on the game as a whole as they were only 15min and had little to no story building. The choices, in the end, didn't matter either as even if a person did the sidequest because every ending is bad no matter what you choose.  Gameplay:--- The gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077 has different perk trees so that the player can make many builds for many characters adding to replayability but you realize that doesn't matter when the AI is just as bad as Skyrim's Ai. The Ai will repeatedly miss their shots and some will even glitch out due to bugs and even the NPC's who drive cars ai won't drive the car any further if you get even a cm in front of them. The Police AI is not even existent they will legit spawn out of space and time to get you and the police cars don't chase you at all making for a fall flat police system and the player driving cars is just impossible as driving is so bad that you will mostly be crashing all the time or accidentally killing NPC's.  Graphics:--- The graphics of Cyberpunk 2077 are beautiful and show the potential for next-gen graphics but sadly due to all the bugs it drags players out of the immersion. One of the bugs is in the BadLands where you are driving and you see lots of cars out in the distance but when you go there location they disappear bringing the player out of their immersion and destroying the experience. The settings in Cyberpunk 2077 also offers players fewer ways to turn down the graphics for players with low rigs such as Anti-Aliasing and more.  Controls:--- The controls of Cyberpunk 2077 are fine as they provide options for players to remap keybindings to what they like but  CD Project Red should have also included to make dodge one key tap so that many players trying to multi-tap as to sneak quieter would accidentally dodge and be brought out of sneak and into combat.  Open World: Cyberpunk 2077's Open world feels empty as all NPC's offer generic repeated one-liners and the NPC's Ai doesn't show them interacting with the open worlds and objects Though CD Project Red did put some fun Police quest where you would go and take out scavs but sadly after you do it does not impact night city and NPC's don't respond to the player differently in any way. The only interesting open-world quest is the ones given by fixers that give you a small backstory and send you to eliminate some enemies.  Conclusion: Cyberpunk 2077 is a game riddled with bugs and broken AI and content that was removed or not focused on and I hope CD project Red recovers from this bad game and makes a better one and or patches everything missing in this game back in and removes the bugs because this game has so much potential and I have been having fun playing it but I cannot sit and ignore these problems. Most of the reviews on the PC side of Metacritic are either all 100 or 1 which is very dishonest and shows that either they haven't played the game or they have rose-tinted glasses on and refuse to admit that this game has problems. So CD Project Red please fix the game because if you don't you will lose all the good faith people put in you and will lose fans forever.… Expand "

I've logged probably 30ish hours on it so far and feel i should tame some of the hype but also stop some of the needless hate: Let's start with the obvious, WHAT YOU ARE PLAYING ON MATTERS. I know you guys dont want to read it or hear it, and i am not dismissing responsibility of CDPR of ensuring a title runs smooth on ALL release platforms. That said, this game was likely scrapped and redeveloped once the specs and dev kits were given to them for next gen consoles. Meaning, it was made for mid-to-high end PCs and next gen consoles (which are basically perfectly tuned mini PCs). I am playing on an xbox series X so majority of the graphical errors and issues do not occur as frequently or even at all in my experience. I also have many friends who play on PC and they relay the same. Pros: -VISUALS, Game is absolutely stunning. (The fact that all of the world comes alive, day night transitions are so smooth and the graphics look amazing shows me this is a polished product, the light reflections, the shadows, details on things like weapons)-The ENVIRONMENT. In the beginning i felt this game was your run-of-the-mill watchdogs or even GTA open-world environment where it was all pretty like a Forza game but not much interaction...completely wrong. The world is just as large if not larger and the amount of interactable doors, places to explore, and environmentals you can affect or interact with is enormous, at times even overbearing... there's just so much to actually do.-The STORY! One of the biggest reasons you should immediately disregard ANY 1 star review is the story. Even if this game looked like absolute crap, the story is amazing. It is nothing too ""original"" in terms of media in general, but in terms of a videogame story, nothing else can compare to the concept. Its a perfect blend of Sci-Fi, Mystery, and Action. The game has the story depth of Heavy Rain and the fact that so many of the options you're given for dialogue (some of which are timed & can even be used to time-out the chat options and simulate saying nothing) do affect the outcome of the story. Some in an immediate impact way, others take a few days of gametime or even other missions to realize the impacts (i have reloaded several save points just to test as well as receive the effects i want) i don't want to go into the actual story because it's that good i dont want to spoil it. When you're playing you almost get the sense that you're watching a movie and in terms of immersion the game just sucks you in!-VOICES + Keanu Reeves. I wanted to lump Keanu in this section instead of giving him his own ""Pro"" as to not seem like a fan boy. However, i assumed he was just a heavy gimmick or image used to advertise the game with a few cameos thrown in here or there (like norman reddus in the mail delivery simulator) but i was pleasantly surprised he is a huge part of this game, not just in voice lines but in the story and visuals, hell you even play as him at some point and i felt like a complete badass. You can tell he is actual acting in this game, not just reading voice lines. Now to the actual voicelines, this will go in the pro and cons section, the voice acting is top-notch and smooth, fluid, even though they give you the options to fast-forward through dialogue, this is the one instance in a game where im just not tired of it like standard RPGs.NOW FOR THE CONS:-Bugs. Yes the game has bugs. I dont know why i was surprised, i guess i assumed with all the delays that it wouldn't. Majority are small, warping, slight rendering issues, and the occasional dialogue stuttering, i havent experienced anything game breaking)-NPCs. When i say NPC i mean the bystanders walking around in the game. It's just so elderscrolls ""i saw a mudcrab"" or GTA duck and run. No one foghts back and the cops are useless.-CRAFTING. There is much to be desired in terms of crafting and QoL (no crafting slider for multiples)-WEAPONS. Surprisingly not many.

TommyFox,"Dec 14, 2020",4,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Let's just not talk about bugs. Let's talk about the story and the disappointing length of it.  I didn't want to compare this game to other games at first, but I will. A bit. This game was in development for 8-9 years, right? The main story is basically finished in 20 hours ?????? (I will get to side quests soon, don't worry). Red Dead Redemption 2 was in development for 8 years and the main storyline is 48 hours long on average. AC Odyssey was in development for only 3-4 years and the main storyline is 40 hours long.  This wouldn't be a problem IF Cyberpunk 2077 had a really good interactive world and a lot of interesting side quests or other stuff to do. But unfortunately, it doesn't feel that way to me.  The game is basically set in a theme that you, as the main character, are running out of time. I tried to play many side quests along the way with main quests. Could be like 5 side quests with one main quest. When I tried to do more side quests in one go, for example, two-three hours straight doing just side quests, it just didn't feel right. Imagine you are going to die soon and you have to figure out how to stop it. The sooner the better I guess. WIll you just drive around Night City and do all kinds of side quests, like nothing's wrong? I don't think so. I had to play main quests quite often to not put myself out of the immersion.  The point is, I really did not expect to finish the game in 50 hours when I was doing a lot of side quests along the way. I mean how can you make a 20 hours long main story in 8 years? Did they rewrite it many times or what happened? I understand that they wanted to compensate by having an immersive world and a lot of things you can do in the NC. But be honest here, after you play it for a few hours, you realize there aren't that many things you can actually do aside from quests. Or at least things that would be entertaining in some way. It is a shame that I just couldn't complete more or all side quests.  Another thing why I am giving this game a low score. When I got to the point of ""having a girlfriend"" let's say, I expected there to be some kind of progress in our relationship. I slept with Panam, right? It happened in a last quest I had with her, I believe. I know that this is part of side quests, I know that this game is not meant to be about f***ing women, men, stripers, or whatever. But after our sex, Panam never called again. (Damn that sounds really great). When I called her or visited her, there was just one extra option to tell her ""How are you?"". We never got any more quests to do together, the conversation options stayed the same and the relationship just happened to die here for me.  Don't get me wrong, she didn't break up with me, the game still considered us as a couple that like/love each other. Plus this relationship can be game-changing in some way, later on, in the endgame, so I would expect more interactivity. I believe you can have one last quest with her at the end of the game, which is ok, but there's nothing happening meantime. And it is a long meantime.  I know this might be a little thing, but details matter. This kinda killed the immersion for me, again.  The main story itself is good. From the start of the game, it was amazing. Really great plot, unexpected development of the story, characters were designed really well. The city is designed well, neighborhoods look good and gangs are interesting. My ending made me kinda sad tho, I felt like I have no one left, everyone died or left me and I am gonna die soon as well. But nevermind.  And that's it. The only good thing about this game is the main story. 20 hours. In 8 years of development. Anything else outside the main storyline is just somehow not good enough to accomplish the promising hype it had all these years.… Expand "

They are similar to the shenanigans you have in the typical Bethesda game, but while fans have to make unofficial patches to fix Bethesda games, I do not think this will be needed here.  If you love the cyber genre, and you love being immersed in world with rich lore and a good rpg system, buy this game!… Expand "

While people often seem to compare it to GTA V, all I can say is this: It is not a fluent as GTA V was (even though it had it's own share of problems at launch) or as reactive as Red Dead 2 is (with interactions in towns and the like) - yet I believe that Cyberpunk 2077 has a better foundation to work on.  The game looks beautiful, the gameplay is pretty fun, the world gives you lots of opportunities story wise (you can pull a Matrix or a classic GTA story - heck, even draw Gerald in for a side mission). I also, however, want to point out that there are missing a few features: customization (be it car or person, or even the apartment), meaningful choices and maybe worst of all: a better reacting city and police.  It may be wishful thinking that all that may come, but I at least see a chance for it to be added. That would truly make the game a 9-10/10.  All in all, right now: 8/10.

Story is amazing , i like overall topic and execution of that topic. A little bit too short for me but CDPR said it will be shorter game than Witcher 3. Nonetheless the short story doesn't help to bond with characters imho.  Characters are well created , with their own interesting backstory and problems. Immersion is a hard thing to achieve because of bugs and glitches. World is smaller than i expected and this is one of biggest downsides for me. Sometimes it feels really real and alive and sometimes it feels like bad copy-cat of some GTA . Now to more gameplay and mechanics stuff. I want to point out that shooting from guns and overall use of weapons feels really good , especially if you consider that CDPR never done FPS before and they used for this game their own engine. The same thing applies for driving in CP77. Cars are different and are made for different terrains. Many cars have a problem that while driving at high speed they tend to act like a soap in a bathtub. (irritating but not game breaking) and there are some weird bugs in case of calling your car or hitting some things with your car. In the case of AI and NPCs , there are a lot of unfulfilled promises , that's the second biggest downside for me. They are just stupid with IQ of a room temp. I think it can be patched out but the problem right now is just the overall numbness of NPCs/AI and their reactions to what the player is doing to them or around them.  Let's talk about something that is executed by CDPR perfectly , that's graphics. The quality of textures , reflections and lightning is breathtaking. Adding this photomode was a great decision from CDPR. I found myself just stop and take some shots. Actually taking photos was more distracting from the game than the bugs itself. Faces of characters are very detailed , clothing is great and looks almost real. I also really like the overall design of implants , and vehicles. Interiors of cars are really well created and once again detailed. Every place and scene in CP77 has their own little things happening , it's full of everything and details. Amazing how CDPR perfected the imperfections of location they have put in the game. Also I wanted to say something about interfaces. It's very minimalistic and fits with the topic and climate of the game but i have few objections. Minimap is really small , too small. And I don't mean the window of the map is small , the amount of content it shows is just too small. I really often missed a turn or didn't see where I should go. Implant interface is really nice , like how it shows you a x-ray of your V and the way it's all presented. I was slightly disappointed when the changes I made did not change anything with this visualization of the human body. Maybe devs will ad it , but now they have more much bigger problem to solve. Overall equipment interface is clear and easy to use. The only thing missing for me is weapon preview.  There were plenty of situations where I just kept switching scopes because they had some weird color and didn't match the rest of a gun. In case of skills and skill-trees , CDPR went wild. 5 different trees , with 2 or more different sub-categories. If you're worried about if is your style of playing implemented in game , there is a big chance it is.  There are plenty of quests, you won't be bored if you like to stop and do this weird contract that you just happen to drive by. I have one negative thing to say about main story quests. I feel like there are just a few. Too few. This is connected to my problem with the length of a game and it makes sense why there is this amount of quests but still , after the first time playing I was baffled by how fast the main story flew between my fingers. I also would divide side-quests into two types. One that has behind them a long and interesting quest line and the other that are much shorter but still have some interesting and funny stories.In short , if you don't plan to speedrun CP77 and just explore the world , be involved with what is happening in it i really recommend you the game.  Now i wanted to say something to all those people that just cry how cyberpunk is bugged and awful game , worst in history and other **** like that. First , it's pretty childish to base a ""review"" not on the actual game but on your feelings. If you are mad at CDPR for not keeping all promises , then go back and stand in line. I'm also mad how the game isn't a revolution in gaming industry and how CP77 is unpolished/bugged in many ways. And i don't blame you for being angry , i blame you for being angry just to be angry. The moment when ""gamers"" started throwing rocks at Death Stranding for cooperation with CDPR , that was the moment I realized , you are angry just to be angry. It's sad to watch how CDPR is drowning because you just need to scream and cry about the game that promised everything gave you ""only"" a lot. Peace.… Expand "

Been playing their games since Witcher 1, and the general progress each title held for the company was astonishing. Unfortunately with this title areas that compel me the most in games were lacking.  Witcher 3 and its expansions left such a wonderful aftertaste upon completion. While Cyberpunk's experience felt empty. I don't care at all about the bugs many people are plagued by, what I was looking for was an RPG experience. In Witcher 3 you were significantly rewarded for exploring the world. Your choices mattered, and you could see a direct impact on the world from them. But here there is nothing. One of the most expensive games in history, and yet you it does not hold a candle to a game that was done with third or even less of the budget this one did.  While there were some very interesting plot points brought up from a philosophical perspective, unfortunately they fell flat at the end of the day. Even their first Witcher had a plot more compelling and memorable compared to what I witnessed here. All in all its a true shame, and for me the writers really screwed up on this title. Makes me wonder if even the same team was working on it.  But kudos to the art, level design and music teams. They really excelled and for that gotta bump up the score to a 7/10.… Expand "

But during my 60+ hour playthrough I haven't experienced any instability or 'game breaking' bugs that others are complaining about.  The graphics looks amazing, excellent use of reflections and lighting effects (as you'd expect), combat is fun; there is a good balance of 'straight up shooter' and more intricate features like quick hacks once you get used to them. Mele can seem a little hectic but that's no different to any other first person, open world game. Story has been engaging and had my glued to the screen. Side quests, although a fair amount of 'gameplay' repetition (there is only so much a game can allow the player to actually do) give decent variety to the game with enough context to not feel like a hollow 'here is a bounty' - go to quest marker etc. This I feel is similar to the Witcher 3, just using a phone instead of more individual NPC's; obviously that is slightly less immersive but great for player convenience. Diving is a bit tricky, vehicles tend to go very fast very easily so I miss a lot of corners when using the small mini map and slide easily, however this doesn't offend me and is quick and easy to travel around.  Regarding all the controversy, it isn't perfect, they shouldn't have released it on the previous consoles. On PC it is very demanding (I'm playing at 1440p with a 1080 Ti for context), there are plenty of bugs, the only one that bothers me at all is things popping in and out, particularly when driving fast. To be clear I do not find that this ruins the game at all and is not that frequent, but that's the thing I notice most. I trust (hope) that CD Projekt Red are working on all of these and cut features, I'll then play it all again!  In summery, it's the most compelled I've been to play a game in quite a long time. Despite any short comings I've enjoyed every moment I've played thus far. I'd give it a solid 10 with the small glitches fixed, but a 9 for now. I find that almost all of the bugs are the same things you see in all other large open world games. That isn't to say it's acceptable because others have them, but I have been getting the impression that comments and reviews have been needlessly harsh on Cyberpunk thinking that all previous games were perfect, and forgetting the sheer scale of this game.  If you can wait a little, give CD Projekt Red some time to fix bits and bundle extras (and for the new GPU's to come back in stock!).… Expand "

There is lots of cut content ranging from minor things like wall-running to major things like police A.I and ""powerful mercs that come after you for causing to much chaos"" and dialogue choices that matter. Not to say there aren't choices that matter, just very few (mostly at the end of the game).

It's Mass Effect 3 the Sequel.  TLDR points... 1. the game is structurally flawed 2. your in game decisions are largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things 3. it's pretty to look at, if you've got top tier hardware 4. there are many broken or unplayable/unusable elements 5. there are lots of bugs so  you're paying to beta/alpha test this... perhaps in 6 months to a year it might be better  Longer commentary  For me this game breaks the cardinal rule of RPG's / Action RPG's in that your actions in game should have real meaning... and for me, or at least in my experience I see that they don't.  It doesn't matter if I played everything (and I did 90 hours) or if I'd followed what most of the media/YouTube reviewers did and played the main story etc (20ish hours)... at the end you're ultimately presented with a single choice... there are paths to this choice which are unlocked by what you played but regardless of those paths, they all converge to a single binary choice... just like in Mass Effect 3 - how would you like to die  My gold standard RPG/aRPG is Mass Effect 2... because in that game, if you play it just right, make the right calls at the right time, you can save everyone and have a happy ending.  it's not easy and I failed a few times... but it is possible.  And CP'77 would have the potential for this if the writers had deemed it thusly.  It's a factor of two (possibly both) things... time or douchery.  I get the distinct impression that they were rushed, that they didn't have the time they needed to make this what they claimed it would be.... it certainly wasn't shipped when it was ready, that much is clear.  But there were so many opportunities for the story to be better, that I have to wonder if these were deliberate decisions to take a large dump on the player from a great height.  Opportunities to merge with your decision in a more compatible way, for the relationships that you choose to pursue to have real meaning, rather than just another check in the box.  I chose to romance a character, and apart from the quest line which lead me to the conclusion of that romance, that was about all the interaction I had with that character... there were so many times it could have been woven into conversation or into decisions later on... but nope. Those of you that played the Witcher 3 know there are ways to get the 'bad' ending, and the 'good' ending... for me all the endings here are terrible because I feel that basically no matter what I did in the game, my end result wouldn't have changed... ultimately I'm indy in RotLA.  I want to believe that the writers weren't trolling us... but maybe they were... using Hope as the carrot..  I also feel that there are great parallels with the Matrix as the story uses hope and choice like a carrot and stick... they're both an illusion.  ""Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness"" the Architect.  we are lead down the path that there is a way out, and then you find very quickly that is just another form of control... that ultimately your choices are meaningless.  The game is structurally flawed (IMHO)... there is no reason for it to finish the way it does, and really i can't understand why CDPR chose it to be this way... there is no reason that you can't persist in the world after the main story line is complete... why the inevitable DLC's and Expansions need to be shoehorned into the story before the P.O.N.R..  I look to GTA5 for this as a persistent world that doesn't have it's main story as the 'be all and end all' of the world....  No amount of patches will change this...  As for technical things... the game is a mess, there are bugs everywhere, the code is grossly unoptimized and a LOT of the QA process was either rushed or simply not done.  I say this as a software designer and tester (not games)... there are things in this system which are wholly unacceptable but were clearly deprecated in priority to simply get it out the door.  Even though this is a PC review, you can completely see why Sony have removed it from their store.  I'll finish with some good points... it's a pretty game (when it's working), Night City is amazing in it's scope and concept.  however, the execution is poor.  I don't need to revisit others comments on how laughable the NPC AI is.  but conceptually it is a visual spectacle.  I have taken many fantastic screenshots with photo mode which I really treasure  In conclusion... i feel disappointed and let down.  I waited 8 years for the game, and really hoped that it would match the output that CDPR had achieved before.  put aside the technical elements that can be fixed, the game (for me) is devoid of the heart that made the Witcher series... and it didn't need to have that missing...

ATinyHorse,"Dec 18, 2020",7,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          It is nowhere near as good as some fanboys are making it out to be, but also nowhere near as bad as most people think. It has a very good story which feels short because most of the story is also beefed by the side missions. Speaking of, side missions range from well-developed and interesting, to by the numbers map filler, though granted is nowhere near Ubisoft level of repetition. Every character feels fleshed out and well done, they feel like days of research and lore building were gone into creating these characters. Not one single character feels one-note, boring or lacking personality. Even some minor characters feel real. Of course, I'm talking about characters who aren't pedestrians, but we'll get to that later. This game could have been revolutionary thanks to these core strengths, unfortunately even the most basic of RPG elements weren't there. You can't get a haircut, you cannot customize your car, ou can't buy new houses, there is no public transport; no flying cars or high-tech buses, NPCs don't interact well with...anything, the weapons are cool, but you can't do stealth kills with melee weapons, which is a shame. Many characters, despite being good, have wasted opportunities for deeper storylines and potential romances. The gameplay therefore feels unsatisfying, leaving you wanting just...more. More of what? Just more. A futuristic zoo where the animals that are left are being preserved would have been nice, future baseball or football, NBA, those would have been cool additions. Besides the one racing storyline, we cannot race in our leisure, there's no Pachinko minigame despite the machines there; if the gameplay took a more Yakuza style, this could have been an amazing game, but sadly, it just wasn't the case. I want to be able to eat at restaurants, dance at night clubs whenever and not just when the story demands I go to a nightclub. These basic things aren't even in the game and it just ruins the immersion altogether. When the game is at its best, I feel a part of night city; alive, bustling, like I'm one of the NPCs just going about their daily lives, but at its worst, I feel like I'm just playing any old shooter where the mission is to get from here to there. As an action-adventure, it's fine, but if it were designed with all the promised RPG elements that should have been in the game anyway, it might have been amazing. All in all, while it IS a good game, simply ""good"" is just not good enough. A lot of things in the game just make you go ""Cool, I appreciate that it's there, but...that's it?"" And of course, the bugs. They can be funny at times, which I cannot get angry at; I mean, if I enjoyed seeing a car clip through a cutscene, then that's no problem, but sometimes I die for absolutely no reason, I clip my own car and fly a few hundred meters back, once again, the immersion is lost. I had fun, enjoyed the story, but without the basic RPG elements, there is hardly any replay value once the main story and major side quests are finished. Which is a shame.… Expand "

(But the storyline seems short, albeit very addictive) SIDE QUESTA. Orders and other activities are very interesting to pass. They reveal many unique details of the world. CHARACTERS AND WORLD. The characters are really alive. Each of them is unique. What are some love branches. The world is well worked out. Space design and atmosphere. BUT. If we look at it from the point of view of interaction with him, I think you yourself understand that he lacks random encounters and other interesting interactions. MECHANICS (pumping, etc.). I liked the transport and management. (I know that many people think differently, but it is not clear what they compare with) The feeling of transport and its behavior is very good, but physics in some places fails (accidents, etc.). I like pumping. It feels like you really choose your path, be it a netrunner, a thug, etc. Perks work - this is the main thing. Bottom line. Despite the price tag of 2 thousand rubles, the game costs more. This is a huge project. Yes, there are those. problems that are slowly being fixed. Yes, there is work to do, but this game has a soul. Exciting storyline, live characters and addictive open world. I loved Knight City. I loved this project. Thanks to CDPR for the job.  P.s Of course, the feeling that the project still needs to be worked on does not leave. But, looking at how the studio strives to improve its brainchild - I sincerely believe that 90% of the shortcomings will be corrected. Major patches and DLCs are ahead. I will follow :)… Expand "

Many systems perform only mediocrely, the inventory system seems a blatant copy from Deus Ex but far worse, the items are just generally uninteresting, there are many weapon copies and the inventory is far too large, another example: there are 2 medical items, one heals instantly and the other over time, but there is no reason not to use the non-instant one at all as it isn't really rarer or more expensive making it feel like a low effort copy to create the illusion of options. Then there is the vehicles, I just didn't buy any because the game isn't enjoyable for long enough to bother getting a vechicle. Stealth is also an example of the unpolished mechanics, just like the Deus Ex games you have an energy currency for powerful attacks and hacks, but they are quite overpowered and poorly balanced, sometimes takedowns are even disabled in missions because they couldnt balance them and no wonder, you can blind enemies with the attack points you get, which basically means you can take down any isolated enemy but doing so requires you to wait a minute before each attack to regain your attack points, trying to hide how broken the hacks are by forcing you to wait between attacks.… Expand "

Things like audio lines missing (praise be to subtitles!), optional objectives not completing, cars hovering in the air etc. but nothing that I'd call game-breaking (perhaps immersion-breaking though), however I've not experienced anything that's taken enjoyment out of the game. To be honest I find most of these small bugs amusing.  I think this game is once of the best story-driven experiences I've ever had (and I've played the everliving heck out of all the Mass Effect games), right up there with the GOATs. A game that hooks you into caring about the characters as much as this one does, is something very special. It's not perfect, absolutely not, but it's still very special.  One thing I will say is that I went into this game blind - I hadn't seen any trailers, I didn't take part in any of the hype, so I personally don't know what was promised and then not delivered.

The story quests are string together in a way that naturally you can never take a break from them and go exploring. Its always directs you right to the next story quest with **** like (alright X is waiting for you in the car right now) so even if you would have wanted to take a break and explore that one guy/girl will be there waiting for you on the side of the road for ever until you show.  -Crafting sucks. You can only craft 1 thing at a time, which would be alright if you wouldnt need hundreds of certain items to craft guns or cloths  -Clothing gives you armor, meaning you cant just dress up how you want unless you dont want to die from 3 shots.  -Stealth sucks, enemies will see you through the tiniest of cracks. Hacking is redundant and pointless.  -Melee stun locks and makes everything a breeze  -A nicely upgraded weapon feels the same as one you loot from common enemies.  -Characters and inconsistent as all hell. They contradict themselves all the time.  -3 Origin stories to start with, all 3 leads to the same start/end and main character personality making it totally pointless  -Map is filled with meaningless and boring go there beg/steal/kill/hack missions  and I could go on and on.

Rather, I'm disappointed in some members of the gaming community. If you're reading this review, I'm telling you: DO NOT FALL FOR THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! You'll be denying yourself one of the best gaming experiences of recent years. Now, I've only been playing this game for what felt like MOMENTS but I've already accumulated about ten hours of playtime. In those ten hours, I've experienced ZERO BUGS. Only a few visual bugs, but did anyone really expect not to encounter any bugs at all? In a game of this size? I mean, come on... the visuals are outstanding. Night City has got to be one of the most visually appealing cities in recent gaming history. And while I understand the people who are complaining bugs, some have gone out of their way to s**t on this game. They're saying that the combat sucks, those role-playing elements are non-existent, that Night City feels shallow, that the story is boring etc. Literally, none of this is true. This is not a dedicated FPS like Call of Duty or Battlefield or something similar. And even then it has great shooting mechanics. The combat feels satisfying, the story and dialogue are intriguing, the animations are out of this world (which makes playing from the first-person perspective even more immersive) and the graphics are phenomenal! I have a budget gaming PC and on high settings, I've been getting a really stable and high FPS. My Radeon Software app says that I've been getting an average of 352.3 FPS, but it's probably somewhere from 60 to 120 FPS. The FPS does go down in certain areas, but it's NOTHING game-breaking. I have total trust in CDPR that they'll patch-out all of these bugs in the coming months, and then they'll shower us with a ton of free DLC's.  I mean, I seriously can't understand some people... you've preordered the game, paid the full price for it, waited SEVEN years for it to come out, sent death threats to the developers and now, after playing it for only a couple of hours, you've decided that it's complete ♥♥♥♥? ""The random NPC's only give one-liners"" WELL WHAT THE F**K DID YOU EXPECT? That each NPC would have a hundred lines of dialogue? I mean, it has literally become impossible to please everyone. What I can't understand at all, however, is that some players are saying the story is ♥♥♥♥ when they've only been playing the game for literally *FIVE* hours? How... how could you have come to such a conclusion? For me, the story has been great so far, you can really see that some heavy ♥♥♥♥'s about to go down in Night City. Blaze of Glory and all that.  TL;DR The game is great and probably another gaming masterpiece from CDPR. Don't buy into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it's not a great game, you'll be depriving yourself of an amazing gaming experience.

Is it alive, breathing and all those other buzzwords the marketing team abused? Nope. It's shallow. Civilians are lifeless bodies, a joke to anyone familiar with Rockstar Games and Bethesda, which in itself is pretty funny. They don't have routes, they appear, walk for a while and then disappear. They have no cycle, they all have the same A.I. Same goes for the traffic and the police system. With the amount of resources poured into this game, it's a disaster that the ""journalists"" were paid off to write such falsified reviews.  And that's nothing on what there is to do physically in Night City. The environment might look nice but every activity in it is cut and paste. Gigs, that are supposed to be the core part of the game, are incredibly shallow. Were you expecting monster contracts from The Witcher 3? Well you'd be sorely disappointed to find out that these don't hold a candle to those.  The protagonist, V, is voiced by over-the-top, annoyingly gruff and yet incredibly generic voice actors. Choices range from semi-pointless to downright meaningless. Paths, V's so-called background choice, adds nothing to the game aside from a short intro and dialogue options that don't matter.  I was bummed when I found out most of the choices in The Witcher 3 didn't matter for the most part but I had no idea just how bad you get from there. To say Cyberpunk has any choices at all is a lie.  The gameplay seems to be a direct copy of any shooter that has come out in the last decade. Except it's not even that fun. It's comparable to Deus Ex Human Revolutions but somehow with even less depth. Gun customisation is shallow and boring. Clothing is non-customisable completely and ultimately random. Want a specific look for your character? Well that's too bad. You roll the dice on what you find and end up dumping it just because you found a hideous piece that offers twice the armour. Weapons are the same. Cars are the same. It's embarrassing that this game came out in 2020 when it plays like something that came out in 2010.  The story itself is pretty forgettable. Keanu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand is jammed down your throat at the jump and somehow misses the mark in every way to feel impactful to the character. He's like a teenager sidekick who just wants cigarettes and alcohol all the time. That would be fine as a side character, not as a MAIN PROTAGONIST THAT YOU'RE STUCK WITH FOR THE WHOLE GAME.  If 2020 has taught me anything it's that humans can always keep lowering the bar. CDPR were praised as the one and only bastion for game developers to aspire to be and yet here we are. Cyberpunk 2077 has completely bombed. It's only a matter of time until the rest of the current players figure out that this game is a hollow disappointment.  Seriously, stay away from this game. Don't support developers that lie to consumers.… Expand "

Swindled. Finessed out of our money by some slick and dishonest marketing. Simply put, this is not the game CDPR said it would be. It's all style and no substance. As an action-adventure-on-rails the game works passably well, there's certainly some exciting writing and interesting missions, but as an open world game it is nothing short of an abysmal failure. The second you step off the beaten path, the cracks in this impressively dense and beautiful game world become undeniable. The stilted and bizarre behavior displayed by NPCs pretty much singlehandedly destroys any hope for immersion in the world; they all just bumble around aimlessly on their lonesome, nobody ever walks in pairs or a group, nobody has anything worthwhile to say to V, they're literally nothing more than moving obstacles. The entire game plays out through your constantly-ringing cell phone, feeding you a neverending stream of unrelated missions you have no particular reason to feel compelled to pursue, it's just a means to add new markers to your minimap to lend the impression that you actually have some things to do. As you wander around Night City, next to nothing ever happens to you, to the point that it's a complete waste of time to ever exit your vehicle; you don't get swept into side missions by chance encounters with important NPCs or anything of the sort, it's just an enormous, lifeless expanse to traverse between mission points. Very few things around the world of Night City are interactable at all; there are no minigames to be played, few shops or vending machines to buy from, just extremely little to do in general aside from doggedly chase down the main story quests.  Honestly, it's shocking how poorly this game turned out. I imagine it'll take a few weeks for the dust to settle and the buyer's remorse to properly set in before a lot of other people will be able to admit it. It feels as though more than half of all the bold ideas for features in this game ended up on the cutting room floor at crunchtime. For now, it's an extraordinarily hollow and unrewarding experience to hang out in Night City, and frankly I'm not sure I see a way in which CDPR could possibly patch their way out of this mess. It's just a downright disaster.… Expand "

I won't address bugs and glitches because at this point it's a widely known issue.  The problems with Cyberpunk 2077 is beyond program faulty. My two main disappointments are broken AI and the lack of side activities. The AI is broken or even worse it's simply non-existent, the NPCs are mostly scripted lifeless husks with zero situational awareness. They exist solely for population density, a background character not inhabitant of Night City. The side activities are very bare bones a couple of things you can do are gigs (side quest), fighting arenas, a few standard shops and vendors to interact with. The side quest are presented to you and as a result it rips the sense of exploration and oftentimes feel very overwhelming. Additionally there are no mini games, vehicle customizations, or even parlor to change your appearance. In sums there are no real life activities in the game.  A few things that also bothering me are the life paths. It has no impact on your story except for the very first 20 minutes. I personally don't like the looter shooter mechanism it's shallow and stressful at the same times. I felt pressured to look and check every weapons and component. The ability to craft legendary items locked behind certain end game perks, where you have already powerful enough with epic-tier weapon. The enemies are bullet sponges and thus makes stealth pretty much useless in high-level area. Lastly the acting, I thinks Keanu Reeves is a fantastic actor but I personally think he isn't the right choices for Silverhand. His acting is a little stiff and definitely doesn't do justice for Silverhand wild persona.  Now onto the good things. The main story is good but I cannot say the same for side-quest some are interesting but some are just you being another errand boy. The voice acting and music are fantastic. The aesthetics and graphics are visually stunning IF you have high-end PC (this game rely a lots to RTX), for medium end PC the graphics is comparable to others modern open world RPG like GTA and Watch Dogs.  Final verdict. Beyond bugs and glitches Cyberpunk 2077 suffers from identity crisis it tries to touch  a lot of things and failed to be excel or even meet the minimum standard of everything it touches. One thing that this game certainly revolutionizes is the marketing and PR. This game isn't worth buying in this current state just wait another year until the bugs and glitches, and more gameplay mechanism fixed.… Expand "

Many ambitious titles have had the same problems the last 15 years.  The story is very interesting a compelling, the atmosphere is the richest i have ever experienced in a game (on pc), the voice acting and music score are on par with The Last of US 2. The extreme amount of dialogue options and gameplay mechanics are wonderfully impressive for a massive open world action adventure (rpg) title.  Playing this game on a PC is breathtaking. If you have a modern gaming PC i would absolutely recommend Cyberpunk 2077. If you are still on old consoles like base PS4 and Xbox i would recommend waiting until they can optimize it further for these older consoles. CP2077 has a massively demanding engine powering it and the needs a good processor and gpu to help deliver, it is simply a demanding task to optimize for a old console. They should have just delayed it for these consoles and released it on pc until they could get it better optimized, however Covid has made work productivity hard this year.  I would recommend not listening to the extreme criticism being offered as most of the love and admiration for this title is being drowned out by the minority of loud and aggressive circle jerkers. Or if you want you can jump on the hate train and miss this fantastic experience, it doesnt matter to most of us having a blast with this either way. Not a single crash has happened in my 20 hours of playing so far.  All in all the vocal minority will move on to something else they can hate and bash on to expend their personal anger and feeling of superiority, and what will remain is a eventual masterpiece. It is absolutely worth every penny. Due to a few bugs this game does not get a 10.… Expand "

I was expecting to get brain dances everywhere, take people to the appartment to have sex, pick up joy toys in every neighbourhood ,and dance to music in lots and lots and lots of places, take a taxi home with someone as i've said...just do freak bad ass fun stuff!  But all this is a smoke screen, I know a few game studio's who could have made this game in 2 years man!!!

That said, the game doesn't know what it wants to be, it's not a rpg and it's not a first person shooter, and it's not a first person adventure game either... and if you think away all the great missions the game trows at you, you keep rather shallow night city that tries to impress you with nothing, and much repetitive side quests and street missions....… Expand "

Central story-line and all major side quests took about 39 hours, so the game itself felt short. However, I thoroughly enjoyed all 39 hours of that time. Many of the quests were memorable, and almost all of the environments were impressively detailed with multiple routes available for various play styles. There were numerous visual bugs, including a few audio bugs that interrupted the flow of the story telling, but I experienced no game breaking bugs (everything solved by a save and reload, no progress lost) and not a single crash. The ending appears to have a drastically branching path of choices, none of which seems to be exactly as it appears. There is definitely some replayablity of the last hour and a half, which I look forward to next. Additionally, there are at least two full playthroughs worth of replayablity for various combat styles (ranged vs. melee).  Overall, a very enjoyable experience. The primary detractor from the experience is that I am left wanting more than I got. Knowing CPR, I look forward to some DLC content-- hopefully that will scratch the itch.… Expand "

OldManGamerOMG,"Dec 11, 2020",10," After nearly 200 hours of gameplay, I can say this is among the most enjoyable games that I have played. I am nowhere near finished playing either.

I am nowhere near finished playing either.  The most notable in this game is the story. Cyberpunk 2077 feels more like a movie with a video game inside, when doing the main story. The brilliant writing, voice acting, soundtrack and more, makes this game among one of my all time favorite games. The options and branching of the story is also enjoyable, as well as background specific quests, that build depth to how the story fits the unique background and choices.  For the obvious, the graphics are fantastic. The game looks amazing and the presentation and environment is very visually appealing. I can drive around the city and enjoy the presentation, or run around into the more narrow areas, and appreciate the many extremely detailed areas that this game has to offer. In all, the city keeps showing me new things that I have not yet seen.  The controls are phenomenal, except when it comes to driving. This game definitely benefits from the controller when behind the wheel. I also feel that the melee combat is a bit lacking, and feels to be button mashing when all is said and done. However, the sneaking and firearms are extremely enjoyable. I enjoy doing missions without ever being detected, using the cyber skills and ranged weapons, or sneaking behind the enemy and putting them into a choke hold. Cyberpunk makes covert play very enjoyable.  The driving on the keyboard is very lacking, as it is a balance of tapping and gauging how much or little your vehicle will steer. I am sure this will be altered or adjusted in time, but I am getting better at it. I find myself sometimes just unable to avoid slamming into the poor bystanders on the sidewalk, just staring in horror at my ping pong style of driving.  My biggest complaint is how much of this highly detailed world seems to be locked and unavailable. So many doors are locked, but I take hope that the fact they show locked with an interaction is a sign this will not always be this way. I am also hopeful for more interactions with the environment, such as arcades. I spent many hours playing Gwent in Witcher 3, the arcade games in FO4, and so forth with the mini-games.  My second complaint is the police, whom seem to be terrible annoying. Many times, I wish there was an option to turn them off, and is the only reason I am not playing on the hardest difficulty. There are times that I cross their view in narrow passages, and they attack me for simply passing by, such as the path up and down from the apartment of V. I am hopeful that this changes as well.  My third complaint is the number of times that I skip dialogue, because I am trying to stand up. I play the game sneaking most of the missions, and find myself skipping initial conversations, needing to reload to see what I missed.  Cyberpunk 2077 runs far smoother and with far less problems than my initial experience with FO4, but comes with its own unique issues. Regardless, this game is amazing and definitely worth the experience. Even with my complaints, this game is a 10/10 for me in value and enjoyment.… Expand "

Игра стала фурором геймдева 2020 года даже не успев релизнуться, но оправдывает ли она это?  Геймплей. Игра не позиционирует себя, как мега-рпг игру, но все же подчеркивает элементы этого жанра. Левелинг, способности, атрибуты - все это основа рпг. И знаете, думая о них, хочется представить то, что ваш билд будет влиять не только на то, сколько урона вы будете наносить в определённой ситуации боя, но также и на действия вашего персонажа в ходе сюжетной линии. Да, есть дополнительные варианты диалога, но я не заметил за ними какой-то важности, что огорчает. Но, в оправдание этому, стоит отметить, что эти рпг-элементы гармонирует с игрой и позволяет вам стать киберкотлетой с таким оружием или стилем боя, который вам нравится. Бои в игре всегда интересные, а система ""хакинга"" расширяет долю экшена в жарком бою или делает стелс более разнообразным (спасибо геймдизайнерам за такую возможность). Таким образом, экшен вам никогда не надоест в этой игре, (а он будет часто, благо гринда нет) а квесты..  Сюжет и квесты. Начнём с квестов, CD Projekt Red сделали хорошую работу, взяв за основу простые цели и сделав их них уникальные приключения в Найт-Сити. Здесь вы можете просто ""побить"" разбойников или помочь ИИ на таксисте поймать ""злых двойников"". Сюжет же занимает главную часть сценария и стоит на первом плане (даже впереди атмосферы), так, сначала нам кажется, что история слишком простая, про друзей-бандитов (прямо как Mafia или GTA), но, в какой-то момент, история принимает неожиданный поворот и меняет вектор. Наш персонаж, имея в начале обычную цель амбициозного человека, становится человеком с идеей (интересно почему :) ) и.. А вот дальше вам самим нужно поиграть, я человек не святой, но все же отдельный котёл в аду не хочу. В целом, сюжет интересный, интригующий, настораживающий и имеет свою индивидуальную фишку, но все же я бы не делал некоторые вещи предсказуемыми, а некоторым персонажам дал бы раскрыться на все 100.  Атмосфера, город и пригород. Найт-Сити - это самое настоящее олицетворение капитализма, магазины, яркие вывески, роскошные дома... А стоп, эти небоскребы для богатеньких, а ты поживи в мегабашне(прямо из перезапуска фильма ""Судья Дредд""). Атмосфера города сияет и ослепляет, тут нечего сказать.  Графика. О да, самое сладкое для любителей некстгена. Приятный десерт... А ОБЛОМИТЕСЬ, Я СТУДЕНТ-БОМЖ. Но игра на средних настройках выглядит неплохо, конечно на более мощных системах все намного красивее, лучики и... T^T (нет, я не плачу, просто.. Просто я придумал такую шутку про классный современный комм и забыл её, но от смеха все ещё идут слезы)  Хорошая игра, 8/10, а я дальше плакать..… Expand "

I pre-ordered this game on PS4, depending on the reputation of the previous games from CD Projekt Red, since November 2019, and I have been waiting for it all that long. The game is very ambitious as an idea, but failed in execution. For example, the brawling missions, the first fight with the twin, that was easy. But the other three fights, I get beaten by one or two blows, and I don't even know what I did wrong, the huge difference between the first fight and the other three is just insane! Another mission with the Delamain cars. It was moderate mission, the car with the easter egg from the game, Portal. The car incited violence against me, and although it was ""moderate"", I found myself attacked by dozens of armed NPCs and when I ran away, the whole mission failed. The main quest is too short, and the game depends solely on the side missions, what am I going to do when I finish the main quest? Run around aimlessly solving everyone's problems? I'm not even looking forward to any expansion anymore. Good luck to CDPR, but this game is not what we expected from you.… Expand "

No wonder my surprise when i start the game and find a disaster of a game, a buggy inferno with broken features all over. Talking about features, the game promised to be ground breaking when talking about how decision making in the game would affect your progress, or how your background would be important. None of this matters, you can't save NPC's from undesired fates, or create a personality for your character (not even customize your appearence after the game's beggining). All of it was a lie to sell an unfinished and broken game to 8 million ppl and counting in pre sales. Even the decision of sending Pc copies instead of the ordinary console copies can be viewed as an attempt to prevent the press to give a bad review hours before the game's launch, which could cost millions of dollars in canceled pre orders. I cant make myself to continue playing a broken game on ps4, and i will wait for new patches and fixes. Because the bugs destroy any immersion that an RPG is supose to create.To list a few problems: Error in graphics in a vatiety of ways like flickering, stuttering, low textures, delayed rendering, missing object collision, npcs and enemies broken AI, few npcs and vehicles in the street, no interaction at all from npcs not meant for quests, no random events, npcs and objects floating, audio bugs, hud bugs, tutorial bugs, flashing, spawning everywhere, invisible objects, no possibility of keeping stolen vehicles, no interation with the world, lack of cutscenes of importance when upgrading your implants (if feels like switching clothes), game crashes constantly, etc. The game doesn't even work properly, so a 5 rate is impossible.

Not trying to point out optimization but missing basic gameplay features.  - In character creation there are premade presets meaning no height, weight, muscle mass, etc. - Very limited options for some of the character creation features (hair color, tattoos, skin complexion, scars, etc). - No Vehicle customization even though vehicles look sick in this game. - Lack of weapon customization. There are few mods to select. But can't customize them like fallout or metro series. - No transmog feature ""yet"" - No garages. Can't store your vehicles. - Crowds barely react and have no awareness to the game world. Expected to antagonize them like RDR2. - Very few interactive NPCs outside of missions with meaningful dialogue. Can't hangout with friends you meet later via storymode. - Lack of non-action oriented stories and quests about meaningful themes of cyberpunk distopia. - Weapon mods and skill trees largely irrelevant outside of marginal and mostly numerical improvements to combat. - Lack of gameplay events in the world. Random cop car chases, bank robberies, etc. - Unable to customize character once you're in night city. No barbershops, plastic surgeon, etc. - No ownership of items. No karma for robbing poor NPCs. - No prison or lasting crime system. The NPCs in game have bounty rewards on them but V doesn't. -Cant use braindances other than scripted missions (I was surprised cause l like the investigation aspect), and do other common activities regular NPCs do all the time. - This one is pretty bad. Wanted system is a joke. The cops literally spawn near you. There's no AI car chases like GTA which is weird for an open world game. - Cybernetics lack variety in meaningful choices that alter gameplay. They have lots of stats to choose in melee but melee combat animations doesn't feel satisfying. Deus Ex has far more impactful mods that actually change the way you approach combat. - The lifepaths are cut content and extremely short. They have little impact other than dialogue choices. V is essentially the same character regardless of past. - The traffic AI is really poor. Once you park your car the AI just waits there without even trying to overtake and also often roadblocks itself. - Trains seems like another cut content. Even though the whole infrastructure is visible. - The world visually looks really good but interaction is quite minimal. Among items that should be interactive: smartphones, taxi, most merchant stalls.. (can't even have a meal there), arcade games and pachinko. - No reliable cover system. You just crouch behind a wall. - This one is critical. Loot system overdone, invasive and distracting. Except to have atleast 200 meds which make the fights easy. You are constantly showered with redundant and marginally better items and have no attachment whatsoever with your fashion and weapon choices. This also means you can totally ignore crafting items.. you can just loot for better gear. - Enemies are too spongy. Feels like futuristic division overall again. But if you make a proper build they will die fast. - Robotics and drone control largely absent (outside of scripted missions).

Its a mediocre game, which isnt bad thing but i would have loved this to be so much better.  I try not to talk about bugs and performance, i think enough people are doing this already.  There is just nothing really standing out whatsoever. I finished the game and cant remember a single ""breathtaking"" moment. I tried to like it so much more, but even after 40 hours, seeing a lot, doing a bunch of sidequests, its just this bland mix of things you already encountered in other games - often executed better than in CP2077.  The city and spaces are vast but there is so little interaction with it. Ill never understand how ""a bigger map"" than other games or a previous game is something to look forward to. Make it half the size and focus on something else - as a player you still wont EVER see everything - even after 100 hours of playing.  Most of the Skillsystem is useless. Im not saying that its boring because I personally dont like it. Im sure there are people who like to play a certain style so there is a lot to choose from but... Getting stronger doesnt feel rewarding at all. Levelcap on items makes doing harder quests for the thrill completely obsolete and not fun at all. On the hardest difficulty ""hits"" just randomly oneshot you more often and people have more Hp - thats hardly nice balancing.  No Quests that give you the feeling of being in danger. No high risk high reward scenarios. The loot and even the process of looting felt horrible. You only go for color indicators, nothing to really look forward to. The inventory takes you completely out of the game - too slow, too clunky, no clear overview of anything - selling is an extremely painful since it lets you sell the things you have equipped and always asks if you REALLY want to sell a legendary item or something you got equipped, also its very slow.  Ill leave it at that, i could go on and on and on. It feels like CDPR fell victim to the same thing every company thats too big, or that got too big quickly becomes a victim to: The wrong people are in charge, the wrong people make important decisions - not only bad decisions but also just moneydriven decisions - its not a project of ""heart"" anymore, Im certain its not the lack talent of some people but it feels like the get shut down by the ""moneymen"". Its just another title to fill the wallet. Too bad it has to be like this, i guess there is no way around it. Even Blizzard and Bethsda got caught - but only after a long reign of wonderful sunshine.  I dont think DLC's can fix Cyberpunk - maybe im just saying this out of desperation but i honestly think there are just too many things that are not good (enough) in this game.  I appreciate the effort, it was a brave try, sadly to no success in my opinion - not even close.… Expand "

The characters were memorable and believable. Johnny Silverhand, who is stuck in the player's head is one of the most interesting story devices and personalities in the history of gaming. The city is big and beautifully crafted, with a huge attention to detail. This is an RPG, so the character builds greatly vary in how they're played. I've played as a sneaky male hacker and a one punch woman and the way I'd have to approach dealing with potential threats couldn't have been any more different. What is lacking here is the overall balance: e.g. the melee fighter could tank almost anything including heavy guns and grenades but would get one shotted by exploding gas canisters, the athletics skill is progressed by sprinting or punching air and therefore is a pain in the arse to level up. Another thing that was a pain to look at was the AI of pedestrians, drivers and the overall design of how police and crime work. Driving cars is quite decent but motorcycles jump up and down as if made of rubber. Hopefully these will be ironed out by further patches. Overall this is a huge game and the bugs and glitches only affect very minor aspects of the gameplay, whose focus is on storytelling and making choices.

""Hello food vendor, can I buy some f-""  ""JUST WHO THE **** ARE YOU??""  Nothing is interactable. There are no activities you can do to experience the culture of a dystopian city, Cyberpunk culture, or just a city in general. You cannot even alter your cosmetics, in a setting where cosmetic enhancement and fashion are integral. Not even a tattoo or haircut.  You shop for cars via receiving random texts from NPCs. You can't go to the bar and have a drink. NPC AI is atrocious. No AI is capable of anything beyond their scripted events. A guy is banging on a vending machine for eating his money, you hack it so it despenses all the food, and he continues to bang on the vending machine. Cops spawn out of nowhere and then despawn if you crouch in a corner for long enough. ""Random assaults"" are just a small group of gangsters standing over 1 dead guy. Arcade machines are everywhere but you cannot play them. Cars follow 1 scripted path and just stop working altogether if you park in front of them, and then when you turn away, they disappear and are replaced with a different car.  Nothing in this world is believable, and exploring the city is empty and shallow. You never feel like the world would continue living without you, you feel as if they'd despawn when you leave. These are issues that aren't going to be fixed by patches. These are issues that will hold the game back from being great forever.… Expand "

The gameplay is completely fine, but less interesting than any other FPS of the last couple of generations. The story moves way too quickly, and the side quests, while sometimes fun, don't really convince me that this is a living world.  There is also the issue of CD Projekt Red trying to both make a blank canvas and a fleshed out character in V. We can customize him/her, yet it is very obvious from dialogue that he has a personality out of our control. The combination is a very frustrating experience of trying to roleplay and being forced into this bland and opinionated character.  The RPG elements are basically non-existent, with skill trees mostly providing insignificant percentage upgrades, and rarer weapons feeling completely useless due to the loot distribution.  The highlight of the game is how the city looks while not in motion. CDPR use beautiful colours and advanced techniques to make the city look beautiful, and yet it feels completely lifeless. When you see all of the NPCs walking around as if they have a completely random path you feel like you're playing a game that should predate even Oblivion.  All in all this is a very flawed game that I don't think will be fixed in the foreseeable future.… Expand "

It's not terrible either, but it's definitely far from what it was advertised as. The city looks nice, but there's nothing to do outside of questlines, so you don't rerally get to ""live"" Night City.  The story is not half bad, but it's totally on tracks. There are a bunch of endings (which quality may vary), but other than that, the main questline doesn't change in the slightest depending on what you have chosen previously.  The game lacks some features that were standardized in much, much older games. Not only you don't get to change your body, you don't even get to cut your hair. You don't get to customize your cars, not even on the inside. If i have to be honest, i've come to realize that the game was flawed when while exploring night city, i took my time to explore a cool looking club, and i couldn't even order from the barman.  And now, we can step back into reality, and remember that the whole game is -again- a buggy mess. There was not a single moment that i was enjoying that wasn't ruined by a bug of some sort. It actually became quite funny to witness all the janky physics and the disappearing stuff throughout the game.  Without the obvious technical issues, CP would be barely passable, but definitely far from the standard that i would have expected from CDPR.

The world looks beautiful, even on medium settings and the stories that are simply told through the environment are en par with the Witcher 3. I don't understand how people can call the decision making ""flat"", or call it ""not an RPG"". It has every element an RPG needs. Just because it doesn't highlight it to you that your decision affected the story, doesn't mean the story is flat. I already had multiple encounters where my ""small"" decisions made a huge difference in the end.  I acknowledge, that there are some issues with this game. But that doesn't make the game bad. I honestly didn't encounter nearly as many bugs as some people make it out to be. The only real immersion breaker is the police AI, but listening to CDPR this will be fixed soon. People forget how different the Witcher 3 was before it received its updates. People only found it playable by update 1.10 after launch and still call it a masterpiece today.

Also 3 patches from now to the beginning of march!? If those 3 patches fixed everything then that'd be somewhat okay but they won't come close.  They're trying to put a band-aid on an amputation. The bugs & glitches are only a small part of this games problems.  Terrible AI in virtually every area Terrible police system Game engine with disgustingly bad LOD's & car sprites NPC & Car spawn issues Bad map UI design (easily fixed) Non-interactive NPC's & virtually non-reactive NPC's Hilarious character shadow animations etc. Pointless dialogue options in most cases  Then other problems like the fact this 'RPG' is barely that & the open world has nothing people love about open worlds, can't go for a drink, can't go play pool, can't go to a gun range, can't go into a restaurant or food stand & get some food, no garage, no car customization or weapon customization, not as serious but it shows how lazy this game is when there's only 1 model for the prostitute in this 'mature' game that heavily marketed that area of the game.  Of course i love parts of this game & I'm not saying this should be GTA but it lacks immersion & activities & feels like a bad Ubisoft game in many ways. The developer both straight up lied about many aspects & way, way overhyped other parts. More fool us.  Without any bugs or issues listed above, I'd rate this a 7 at most for everything it lacks in RPG & open-world. With all these issues & no sign of it ever being anywhere near the game marketed, it's a 4.… Expand "

Driving cars is no fun at all, you have no flying vehicles and the NPC routines and behaviours are laughable.

The game itself however is a **** They promise u immersivness, they promise u ""RPG"" . rejoice the game is so immersive you can live your dream of  flying through cars and walls, you can T pose while riding a bike. Its an amazing RPG; you can now spend your life  gathering weapons you cannot  customise (with the exception of mods) just so you can dissassemble. Forget about the crafting system, it's broken and useless. forget about the traits features, they are bland and only there to serve as placeholders. You wanted mantis blades that make you a god? Great guess what alot of the features they promised with those are now removed, however they do have a great feature !; they will gladly block u into a 5 second animation which will get you killed. wanna kill enemies as a ninja with stealth? Rejoice  you can't use weapons for it. I loved this company, they straight out lie to the console  players and they straight up paint  a diferent picture of the gameplay  on PC. You can have whatever N.A.S.A rig you want, it won't change the fact that you cannot even immerse yourself in the last thign the game had. you can't enjoy quests or stories when your objectives cannot die cuz they bugged out. My only regret is that i bought this game on GOG instead of steam, I wanted to help them and also tried the game for hours through all the buggy mess. at the end? You can't possibly immerse urself in this game. Maybe; like people say it will become better like witcher 3 did. Good luck with that it's already too late.… Expand "
driedbonsai,"Dec 14, 2020",0," It's unplayable, too many bugs, glitches and crashes. It's a shame and one of the biggest disappointment I ever had as a consumer and probably the worst experience as a player. "
MasterofThrees,"Dec 15, 2020",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I haven't experienced the bugs that others report.  I also don't have high end hardware, so I'm not letting these two things affect my rating. I was never expecting the incredible raytraced scenes they've created with my mid-tier hardware.  But I'm used to getting 2k/60 so was expecting everything to look a bit better considering I'm stuck with 30fps no matter what I do with the settings.  My computer still rates higher than the majority on Steam, so would expect a developer releasing new games to be optimising pretty well for what I've got.  I'm not shelling out $1500 just to play this game and I think if you are one of the few who did you'd still be incredibly disappointed.Because even if it looked perfect, it still wouldn't be a good game.  It just isn't good enough at ANYTHING to really be fun.It's meant to be a RPG, but doesn't have the elements to make it a good RPG.It's meant to be a Shooter, but the shooting also isn't fun.So what are we playing for?  The story?Spoiler Alert - The game rushes through the intro so quick you've got no affinity for your character - no knowledge of the world they're in - before their life is turned upside down.  It should be tragic but the only tragic thing is that as the Player, you simply don't care.Tidus got through Zanarkind pretty quick before his life was turned upside down.  Square did enough for me to care.  CDPR didn't.And after that it's just 'V' doing missions with a bunch of other poorly developed characters that you don't care about.  (And are actually pretty annoying!)In terms of an RPG - you can control how 'V's face looks and what he/she carries between their legs and that's about where it stops being an RPG and becomes a story based shooter.The normal options that you would expect from a character creator don't exist.  How tall, how fat, no - all 'V's are a standard height and build.Once in game, you have no control of 'who' your character actually is.  The dialogue options don't matter, just maybe selecting Corpo let you cut to the chase and skip a little part of it.  It doesn't change who you are or what you're going to do, which kills any replayability you'd expect from a real RPG.So you're meant to be this badass gunslinger, but the gunslinging is anything but badass.Any difficulty that exists is health bar based.Please CDPR, don't threaten NPC's with a gun to the head if you have to pull the trigger 10 times to kill them!  It doesn't make sense!I can understand when coming up against some dude with a titanium skull - but the grunts don't have that.  The result is the feeling that gunplay is flimsy and not worth it.  I've found myself avoiding combat, not through nessesity but because it's simply not fun.I'd rather the difficulty came from facing a clever, fast paced AI or by being overwhelmed to the point that I just can't shoot them fast enough.  But instead I have one guy just stood in the open, another hiding behind a pot - both posing easy targets to shoot a billion plastic bullets into until they drop dead.  Their mates in the next room never respond to the gunfire, they just stand in their spot waiting for you to come and repeat the process with them as well.And that's where the game falls down.  It should be doing so much more that it didn't do.  And what it does do just doesn't play well.All it's really good for, if you can afford the RTX, is finding a spot to take pretty pictures.… Expand "

Then it's AI, there's no AI, cars get stuck in traffic and ill stay there for as long as you're present there, they will never try to find way to manouver obstacles or anything like that. All NPCs will react the same to your actions, as example: gather few cars in one location and throw granade, they'll just leave vehicles and crouch forever, all of them, at the same time. There's no police in this game, i mean there is in scripted scenarios, or if you attack someone then randomly few officers gonna spawn around you out of sudden just to kill you, they'll try to kill you, doesn't matter that you're in middle of nowhere in badlands or in the middle of the city - they'll just spawn. Also CDP didn't code them to actually chase you so from any gunfight you can simply run away. Random NPCs will always perform same RP, doesn't matter how many times you'll go to that spot, you will always see same npcs doing same voice acting and all. Some missions are bugged to the state where only loading previous save will help you, potentially losing hours of progress (happened to me three times).  Textures that are poping in on SSD (tested on NVME with same result), cars and peds randomly dissapear. Crowd density is rather small and this is big city, on top of that crowd density option kill fps on lower-end machine.  There are issues with optimization, on Ryzen CPU you need to modify *.exe file in order to bring back support for SMT and have normal CPU utilization which grants free even 20fps, GPU in many cases is not even used at all while your FPS is low.  I've over 20 hours played for now. Story is pretty cool and if you ignore sandbox aspect which doesn't exist then the game is pretty fine, but as soon as you try to do something else than just missions then you'll experience all of the bugs and issues with this game. It'll require many months until it's in ""playable"" state. As a fan of RPG games im truly dissapointed.… Expand "

Por otro lado, la historia del juego y la narrativa actual de el mismo me esta enamorando, atrapando cada hackeo, cada apagón de cámaras que hago en tiempo real, cada misión que se me otorga y la posibilidad y libertad que me da. Son pocos y nada los juegos que me la han otorgado y estoy muy sorprendido de la calidad del juego (en mi experiencia como jugador de PC)  lo jugué el día de salida con el parche ya puesto y los bugs que presentaba el juego eran los típicos de cualquier sandbox que sale el día 1, Para la actualización 1.04 los bugs visibles eran ínfimos ya que yo me limitaba a salir a recorrer las calles, visitar a los riperdogs y completar misiones secundarias , ayudar a la policía o casar a npc con recompensas ( dejando de lado que también sigo la historia principal) el juego me a parecido un gustazo enorme y de momento me esta convenciendo de lo que realmente es, un juego de rol con posibilidades de hacer las misiones como se me plazcan, en mi caso es el sigilo,  el juego lo fomenta mucho y aun mas si mis atributos de temple y fuerza están avanzados. el juego premia cada decisión en combate como en sigilo y fomenta cada forma de jugar de manera totalmente independiente, aunque si tienes un equilibrio de todo te dejara igual de todas formas.. Las localizaciones y misiones que te da el juego son muy variadas y sin contar de las sorpresas de algunas corpos (motel-notell 4 planta!) que me Han dejado sorprendidos y interacciones así, el poder llamar con mi teléfono integrado y responder a ciertos mensajes me dan una sensación de interacción muy agradable.

These bugs with shards don't cause any blocking of quest progress but could be theoretically categorized in gameplay/progress blocking bugs since what the shards offer could be useful.

Not to mention a weird naked man that would appear on the back of my bike randomly  3rd: Poor AI, literally have seen enemies phase in and out of existence, and the AI is awful. I had to turn the difficulty in the game to near max for a semi-enjoyable experience.  Other issues abound, lifeless feeling NPCs, very poor romance options, and for a game that was hyped as wearing it's sexuality on it's face, it does a very poor job of the racy content. Oh a flash of breast, how risque. The Witcher felt more adult than this game does. Romance options for characters are also really lacking. If they were going to go this poor on the development I'd prefer they went the outer worlds route and left them out entirely.  This is No Man's Sky all over again, and I can only hope they do the same thing they did with that game, and work their ass off to redeem themselves and come up with an actual finished product. They currently do not have one.  I ignored most of these issues, and I was still having an okay time, despite speccing accidentally into a build that was absolutely broken (who thought it was a good idea to have a sniper rifle that shoots and sees through walls? The balancing in this game is very poor). Then I find out there is literally a game breaking time bomb bug just waiting to destroy your savegames on PC. Your save gets over 8mb? Congratulations your save file is corrupted. No fixing it, you should just restart at this point.  I can overlook a lot, but as my savegame (playing through normal means using the crafting system) is rapidly approaching 7mb, and their response so far has been they are looking at it, and ""might"" fix it, that was too far.  When buying a game that costs 60$ I expect a polished, relatively bug free, experience. One or two, no big deal, as long as the company is going to fix them. This kind of bug is absolutely unacceptable in a AAA release. To contrast another game I have hundreds of hours on AC:Odyssey, I encountered maybe 2 bugs in my entire playthrough, and certainly my game was never in danger of just breaking.  This was a known issue in the witcher 3 as well, so it's not like they had no idea this was going to happen. They chose to release the game in this state.  Should they fix that, I'd say the game is probably worth around 35$ tops. This is not a 60$ quality release. I'd save my money for a sale if I were you. With the savegame bug still a problem, I wouldn't buy it at any price.  This is the first time I've ever requested a refund for a game, but it simply isn't in a state where it should have been released.… Expand "

То, что я испытал тут, пусть и не в течение всей игры, но в нескольких моментах точно, я по моему не испытывал больше нигде. Это особенная атмосфера, особенные персонажи, они запоминаются. Отдельный респект за дополнительные квесты, они реально интересные и их хочется проходить, так и мало того, они даже иной раз могут сказываться на сюжетной линии, я не припомню такого в других играх. Я не понимаю почему игру сравнивают с GTA, у которой опыт в создании подобных игр - больше, которая не является РПГ, которая имеет свой движок для NPC, который так же создавался многие годы и прошел очень длинный путь. Это сравнение не объективно, во всяком случае не должно сказываться на оценке. Эта игра должна в первую очередь цениться за сюжет и атмосферу, которую разработчики, по моему мнению, полностью передали. Спасибо им большое.  Единственное, я могу понять консольщиков, с ними и правда обидно вышло, но опять же устраивать из этого какой-то сюр не стоит, вы раньше не видели багов? Вам не с чем сравнить, когда компания реально вас кидает? Возьмите Fallout 76 и сравните ситуации. Я не сколько про баги, сколько про отношение компаний. Дайте время разработчикам и посмотрите, что будет.  В Cyberpunk помимо багов, есть один минус, который многое решает - плохое знакомство юзера с интерфейсом. Ты буквально теряешься во всем, в первые часа 2-3 игры, потом быстро привыкаешь и все идет, как по маслу, вот только не всем может терпения хватить.  Для студии первый опыт в создании подобного детища и говоря про тех же Rockstar, мы понятия не имеем, что получилось бы у них, если бы они взялись почти с нуля за подобного рода проект, при тех же условиях, не имея за спиной такого большого опыта.

Gattsu88,"Dec 12, 2020",10, Truly a BREATHTAKING achievement! CDPR has done it once again and created the most mindblowing open world experience the gaming industry has. Last time I felt this way was with The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 is definitely one of the greatest games ever made.

That's where I think the game really shines. The voice actors did a good job too, and the characters are visually the best I've ever seen in a game.  Needless to say, the game is pretty heavy on my PC, which doesn't come as a surprise, considering how darn good it looks. It truly is a next-gen game. Then we have the topic of bugs. Sure, they are immersion breaking, but definitely not a deal breaker for me. I trust that many of the bugs will be gone with the upcoming patches, the hotfixes already fixed some of them. I'm not saying the game is perfect (not minding the bugs), for example the police system is really bad. It's also very strange that people can change any part of their body they like, but there are no barbers or tattoo artists?  The game shouldn't be compared to other open-world games such as GTA, because it is a completely different type of game (especially the combat). Since you can't give a review with a decimal number score, I am rounding it up. For me this is a no brainer ""must play"", I usually don't start a new game directly after finishing it, but this time my fingers are really itching for more!… Expand "

Of course it takes a lot of power from your computer which it may not provide yet - same for Witcher 3 back in the days... Or can it run Crysis?

If you call this a masterpiece, you must get your head checked. It's so bad, that I am actually worried about those gamers, who are fine with this or deluded enough to like it. It's nothing short of a complete failure and absolutely pathetic. It would have been better to not play any game for the duration of my 10hrs of playtime. It was at that point that I started shouting profanities about game design and writing 101 at my screen and decided to uninstall the game. I'd rather not play any games, than to start up this garbage again. Just thinking of how they implemented the police makes me shake my head with disbelief, that this game was made by professional game designers. Looks more like a tech demo, where someone said ""If we use 100mil$ in marketing and 1mil$ on the game, we can get rich!"" and rich they got. I hope they cry themselves to sleep, reading these reviews of their garbage game, because they deserve to suffer as I have playing it, which is immensely. 0/10, I'd rather play Playstation2 era GTA, as it was lightyears ahead of this garbage in any dimension fathomable.

Even the Mantis blades which have an extra broken finishing move and a lunge that launches you 40m away/kills you depending on the terrain.  - The skill tree only gives you ""invisible"" or % buff content... Just look at Deus Ex perks as a comparison. After a while they ran out of ""non-content"" skills to put in so we have garbage like: ""10% bonus damage against moving enemies"" or ""10% bonus damage when shooting from cover""  - The arsenal is small, and your inventory gets littered with the same non-memorable weapons, just slightly higher stats.  - The weapon customization is 2 attachments. That's all.  - Driving sucks. There are a couple cars that handle well, and buying your own car is a chore to farm.  - ARMOR: I finished the game in a purple mini skirt, because it had the best stats among all I found, and even if I upgraded my cool looking armor to not look like a clown, those weren't ""orange"" rarity with 3 attachment slots, thus the pink miniskirt had to stay.  - Wanna buy a set of clothes to look cool? Good luck! All vendors sell random clothes, not specific sets, and even if you find a cool looking baseball cap, you might not be the level to physically put it on your head.  - Your choices don't matter... except for 1-2 moments or dialogue options which don't carry over at all, but at many points it is just the same outcome for all ""back stories"".  The endings SUCK. Big time.  This game was a scam, and a great scam.

A buggy mess is my main take. The framerate with DLSS off is very unstable. The audio indoors has some weird inside a tin can effect. Toggling crouch works when it wants to. Unable to pick things up off the ground. Unable to remap the F (pick up) key. Characters clipping through walls. We better not talk about the AI. What CDPR failed to realize here is you can create a open world, but when you have these types of bugs which are so jarring, it pulls you right out of it. It reminds you it’s just a video game, and a buggy one at that. Again I say, 8 years.  Performance? Forget about it unless you’re on the latest and greatest. I’d say my rig isn’t a slouch. Certainly not the best, but definitely not a pushover. Settings in this game cripple it. Ray Tracing? Unless you’re ONLY using the base option on medium, get ready for a hit. And as stated above, turning off DLSS at 2160p or 1440p will TANK your FPS to 30 or sub 30. Only after a couple of hours tweaking was I able to maintain 60+ in Night City at almost all times. “Almost” because you’ll still get drops seemingly out of nowhere.  Now I will say this; compared to the console version the PC version looks much closer to what CDPR showed us all those years ago. Unlike its console counterpart, the city is vibrant with NPCs making it feel alive visually. And the art direction really is great if you’re into the whole cyberpunk aesthetic. But the dialogue feels try-hard. Beating you over the head with slang and lingo. It just tries so hard to show you how much of an edgelord it is. If the Hot Topic t-shirt wall was a video game? Well this is it; Cyberpunk 2077.  Combat I mean I guess you could play sneaky? Stealth and hack your way through, but not sure what it really gets you aside from personal enjoyment. So far I see no real need to do it as you can just faceroll enemies with guns and melee. So unless you just want to feel all sneaky and spend way more time during encounters? Not sure the value of playing it without going in guns blazing. Maybe that will change further along, but sure hasn’t here in the first few hours. Combat feels chaotic, clunky, and at times claustrophobic.  I know. I know. How can I give it a review if I’ve not beaten it or spent 1000000 hours on it. And I’m not admitting to having beaten the game yet, but being several hours in up to this point now I can say that Cyberpunk 2077 is feeling like all flash and no substance. At its surface it looks like a world brimming with possibility. But at every turn you peel a layer back and see that it’s paper thin. No depth to the world. And after the initial prettiness of the world wears off? You’re left with what feels like a hallow world devoid of any real substance or depth. Only thing keeping it from one star is the art direction and some of the voice acting which at times was solid, but the lines can be cringy.  CDPR really aimed high with this one and landed well, well short of the mark. A soulless game full of bugs that could’ve used more time in development and stronger direction. Next time they should just stick with what they are good at.  Wait for a sale and/or for SEVERAL patches. And even then, lower your expectations dramatically. This is NOT the future.… Expand "

Even oblivion had better conversations with npcs. I can't be mad with gta, they really didn't promote the interactions with npcs.The best clothes will make you look like a clown. I literally just found a pair of PINK SHORTS THAT HAVE 80 OF ARMOR. Pathetic AI,cops spawning behind you whenever you dare to touch an npc.Character progression - basically you dont need any upgrades or because most of the time you can't tell the difference,you don't get new abilities beside hacking which is medicore at best.Only few of the choices actually have impact on the story, most of the times they are just here to make the game longer.Although the graphics are good, the lightning is pretty bad and also it runs TERRIBLY on old gen.Lifeless city, you can't interact with anything or anyone.The driving feels sooo bad, and you will find yourself driving around this lifeless city for a big chunk of the game.No ragdoll for the player, for example, when you get ran over there's just a pre made animation.So basically, this game is just a futuristic borderlands.They could've done so much better if they didn't spend so much time in marketing and making jokes on Twitter.

Nail in the coffin were the lies by the developer which full well knew the state of the game while intentionally misleading the audience and reviewers and spending resources on masquerading the underdeveloped game by means of forging fake demo gameplay. ""Coming when it's ready"" is a bittersweet joke.… Expand "

However, they are mostly graphical. I didn't experience a single crush or gamebreaking problem. Only mere HUD glitches that could be solved by making a quicksave and reloading. The gameplay is fine, weapons feel powerful but lack satisfaction. Dismemberment is present and looks great, sneaking works but doesn't do more than that. Driving is kind of clunky, but after a few hours one gets used to it, the vehicle variety is great.The main story is great, the characters are very realistic, lifelike even. Though it is a short main story, it's a great one. One of the endings in particular had me in tears. The side missions are huge, often connected to characters you meet in the main storyline and can impact the ending drastically. Some boring side quests do exist and the open world activities aren't that great. Night City is probably the most interesting open world I have ever seen. The sheer beauty of it is amazing, paired with levels of detail that are unbelievable. All in all, the gameplay serves its purpose and Night City is one of the greatest open world I have ever experienced.If the graphical and small gameplay bugs get fixed (including the sometimes poor performance), this may very well be a game that lives up to the immense hype it had.

There are some things I want to clarify: People who cannot start the game or are getting overwhelming graphical issues: install the fcking graphics driver from Nvidia (v 460 is the current). Another thing, there are a lot of people who dislike this game because they didn't end up having a life-changing experience from it. These are pixels on a screen. It is a video game. Stop being disappointed because your real-life shmeat isn't as big as your characters. Now then, onto the game. Firstly, the game is stunning. Ensure that you have the appropriate settings for your machine, but if you do, you will be blown away by the quality of the graphics. The gameplay is superb, albeit the gunplay and driving are nothing revolutionary, the quality and quantity of missions with fun winding paths, the amount you customize your characters skills to be the perfect whatever you want them to be is mind-boggling, the sheer scope of the world is incredible, the writing can be beautiful, satirical, intense and heart-wrenching at all the same time. I am 26 hours into the game as of right now, and I cannot speak for the full quality of the story, but what I have seen thus far is incredible. Truly, this is one of my favourite RPG titles of all time. This all being said, there are bugs. Now, you are probably wondering why I would give a game with plenty of bugs a 10/10, to which I say look at the witcher 3. The Witcher 3 on launch was almost unplayable but is now considered to be one of, if not the best, fantasy RPG of our generation. I have faith that CDPR will patch any outstanding issues before the halfway mark of 2021. That being said, the bugs are almost entirely graphical, and there is very little gameplay affecting bugs. Overall, this game is exactly what I had hoped for and is an excellent experience thus far. I highly suggest you buy and play this game.… Expand "

Not that many settings to adjust and the game doesn't tell you anything about their performance impact or if they are CPU or GPU intensive. -I'm not playing the game on console, but the review embargo for these versions was pretty scummy and needs to be mentioned, as CDPR clearly mismarketed this game for these consoleplayers. -physics are bad -NPCs are terrible -Cops don't even chase you by car. -many features were first advertised and then cut out of the final game.

Some are just immersion breaking, others completely ruin aspects of the game. If I was giving this game a rating based on how it currently is it would be a 2. I’m going to try and overlook them to rate the game based on its story and gameplay however.As far as an RPG Cyberpunk is severely lacking. It has similar cause and effect as something like Red Dead Redemption 2, with the game mostly being exactly the same bar a few minor differences based on dialogue options, and a few different cutscenes. Outside of that there’s almost no RPG elements, limited customisation, a superficial empty world with zero interaction, and an awful loot system. The story missions are fun, but I find myself not caring for the characters and it all feels quite rushed. The writing is nothing special and often I’m confused on what is really happening. Graphically the game is fine, nothing amazing, but it doesn’t look bad either. There are many better looking games out there. (And there are plenty of graphical bugs)There’s almost no feel to Night City, locations have no backstory or lore, side quests just send you to a building and you kill everyone inside, that’s it. Overall this game is disappointing, lacking features and definitely shouldn’t have been released in this state. Despite that it has some fun elements, so a 6 is justified. Pick it up when it’s on sale as the game is big enough for some hours of fun but just don’t expect anything to really get your teeth into.… Expand "

The 3 life paths are a joke. They are under 30 mins of gameplay. Yes if you go around exploring that's one thing but actually mission is terrible. I don't feel any connection to the life paths beside a few choices when speaking to NPCs. Romance options are a joke with nothing compared to the witcher 3. You have very few romance options in the storyline and for ""joy toys"" there are only 2. TW3 had what 2 different houses with like 5 each. That game isn't for porn I get that. But it's the point that it feels like an afterthought like it's not really meant to have it. The graphics are great, but that's PC. What the game gets right is the city. It feels alive if you are playing with ULTRA settings so that it fills the city. Driving is not great but it's not a driving game so whatever. Weapon modding is amazing. Crafting isn't thrilling. End game well there isn't one. You have to go back in time to a save and just run around. So that makes me wonder how the DLC will be added in. Will be it after the final or before. Combat works great. I feel the weapons are good. I have had some bugs. However, none of them broke my game. Also, I have had no crashes. The game is at best right now a 7/10. With the DLC and patches, it will go up. I don't see how they could fix any of the storyline issues or the lack there of. From the main story. So all we will have to wait for DLC.

In 30hrs I have only encountered 1 minor visual bug on a tutorial screen for 2seconds, and another when Jackie walked into an elevator, then the door opened 2sec later very minor, yes I downloaded the day 1 patch, and installed the game ready drivers like people should (but are not for some reason & complaining). I have no idea what people are complaining about. This game is the most impressive open world RPG experience I have ever played in the last ~10 years. The level of detail ( if you have a 3070, and up) is astounding, a lot of the quests feel hand crafted, all the stories you can find in the side quotes, and sometimes just exploring gets you into a mini story, if you read all the journals & clues you might find. The main story is very deep, and satisfying, the hacking is amazing, very intuitive, so is all the gun combat, you can actually sneak through missions without ever firing 1 bullet if you are sneaky sneak. The vehicle driving I was concerned because they did not have a background in vehicle physics etc, but the vehicles feel like they all have their own weight, speed, and personal touch, not to mention that speedometer THANK YOU (looking at you GTA). I would rate this 9.7/10 for my initial experience; however I understand consoles, and others on PC that never bothered to update drivers, patches of have the minimum spec or lower hardware will not have a great experience. I would like to add that, if you know the game is advertised as ''next gen'' then maybe you should consider having ''current gen'' hardware to have the complete experience. All in all 2020 is just full of people that want to nit pick instead of appreciating what the game really is, a true AAA title, next gen graphics ""crysis level performance when it came out"", amazing story experience, no micro transactions, and incoming free DLC & large expansions.

If anything, I'm quite surprised such a big game runs so smoothly. Bear in mind, I have a high end PC with a 1080 and a 5950X. I see people mention there isn't many AI's. There's a setting for that, and I suspect they must have it on low or medium, because on high, I sometimes get stuck in traffic (specially in the downtown area), and occasionally have to take the sidewalk, because there simply is no room on the road. Complaints about the world being lifeless also seem odd. So far I've been witness to a shooting in the mist of roughly 50 NPC's having everyone, even me, running in a panic, because I naturally assumed I was the target, as per nearly all other games. But turned out it was a random event. I also had something akin to a car bomb go off while I was about to drive around what looked like someone with car trouble. I saw no fire from the car, and the stopped cars could have been the target. Hell, it could be a random ass bug for all I know, it looked cool and made it seem like I was actually part of the city and not the target of literally everything happening in it, as GTA's have been infamous for. (GTAV excluded) I see some people complain about choices not mattering, and again  SPOILER ------------------------- One of the earlier side missions have you talk to a guy who lost a friend, and if you don't complete that, he will commit suicide. Now it's a side mission and it has very little bearing on you, but I don't know what people expected. END OF SPOILER -------------------------  I'm unsure what people expected, I don't feel like I've done enough missions to really say my actions have meaningful impact yet. But I've been congratulated and reprimanded for how I carried out missions (I've reloaded just to see if redoing a mission a certain way changed anything).  So far, the only thing that knocks it down for me, is the slightly buggy visuals (sometimes a pedestrian NPC I drive into to will start teleporting back and furth, almost looks like I hit them and they start lagging) and the occasional spawn of my personal vehicle being inside another vehicle, my only other gripe is with the balance. The hacking in the start seems underwhelming. Using it for distractions is fine and can be quite funny, but for combat it feels like a waste of time. Weapons are a bit, eh. Reminds me of Fallout. Weapons also seems a bit unbalanced. I have gone for MILD SPOILERS AHEAD: using bladed weapons after using the pistol, rifle and sniper. The rifle seems like a waste of ammo, the pistol is good while you're in stealth to initiate combat or if you're lucky the enemies being weak enough for dying to your stealth hs bonus (I use a silenced revolver) and a sniper with consecutive headshots is pretty boss. But they all pale in the face of melee, at least bladed melee. I get near insta kills on very strong enemies that takes 3-5 clean headshots with an immensely powerful sniper, with my Katana or Mantis blades.  Now, I stayed away from spoilers and have barely seen any trailers for the game, so maybe my positive outlook is from not thinking this game is the cure to cancer while being a timemachine. If CDPR fixed those gribes, I don't see why this game couldn't be a 10/10. I find the story interesting and so far of what I've played, I feel like my choices matter enough. People complaining about choice always makes it sound like they want to be able to do exactly what they want to a main storyline, and I can't really think of a game that lets you do that. So far, this game seems to be as ""free"" as Fallout or Mass Effect.… Expand "

I am aware of the bugs and glitches which I have experienced myself, but that's the least of my concerns as it can get fixed (Sorry for you console bros out there).  The world and its aesthetic looks fantastic and is filled with interesting stuff, but at the same time it feels so empty. The NPCs AI are all so basic and makes San Andreas look complex. The Police AI is a joke and is actually worse than any Rockstar game (Yes, even GTA 1). The street vendors, food stalls etc are mostly non-interactive and makes you feel like you're only a spectator of the world. There are not a lot of cars or people in the world for being a large metropolis (Probably due to FPS drops). Random events in the world is basically non-existant. There is so much, but yet so little.  The storyline is really interesting with great characters. It' trully is the greatest aspect of the game and in my opinion is the true beacon of light. I would go in to depth of the characters, but I want to keep this as spoiler free as possible. Let's just say it won't dissapoint you and would in my opinion be the driving force for you to continue playing. The issues I have are the variety of dialogue choices and V's life path is not important whatsoever.  The gameplay itself is decent. Some of the combat feels clunky, the shooting is what you expect from a FPS shooter. Stealth is less than avarage, and the same goes to when you need to take cover.  The driviing is slow and can feel a bit awkward. I find the RPG element interesting, but it's not really a lot to it. I'd say the RPG element is okay at best. The physics of the game is okay, not amazing. All in all, it's a decent FPS game with some RPG elements to it, and that's all it is. It's decent at best.  The customisation in the game is pretty bad. You get to customise your character in the beginning, and that's basically it. No customisation to your body, hair, vehicle, weapons or anything like that later in the game. It makes the game feel much less personal and interactive.  There are no garage or parking lots for you to save your car. There are also no meaningful construct of a personality to the character.

So they can't follow you, there is no high speed chase, there's nothing. Second of all, they spawn 4 meters behind you out of thin air and start shooting you. And they will keep spawning for ever until you run away maybe a block or 2. I alerted the police by accident once when i was in a closed room and they just spawned behind me in the same room and killed me. Out of no where. They cant even arrive to the scene organically they just spawn there. Iv never seen something like this in a Triple A game. Embarrassing honestly. Call of Duty has better **** spawn system.  Honestly i could keep going but this is NOT an RPG and this game is NOT a real open world. If you want to test out your graphics card and follow the main story then you'll like it. But if you were looking for more open world type of experience I don't think this is for you… Expand "

The 'open world' feels less alive and immersive than 1997's LEGO Island. And it is absolutely not revolutionary. It fails spectacularly in every way but its art direction.  My advice?

Despite being able to freely create your own character and choose her/his skills, CDP actually made this less of an rpg than Witcher 3 is. As Geralt you could at least make decisions, as V you just follow the given path. Even unlocking dialog-options by having a skill be high enough will just give you 1-2 additional sentences that change absolutely nothing about the outcome of the conversation, before plunging you back into the path laid out before you.  The controls are spongy even on foot, while vehicle controls feel like steering a brick on ice skates, and the UI is comletely overloaded and just plain ugly, although at least the last point is down to personal preference.  What already drove me crazy in Witcher 3 was how you could just go into any building, anywhere, and just take everything not nailed to the ground, and not a single soul would give a flying f**k. The Police might teleport into a private basement if you stealth kill someone without witnesses, but they don't care if you steal something, no matter how expensive it is. Infiltrated a strip-joint of a gang that doesn't like you, standing in the bosses office right in front of him? Take everything he ownes, he doesn't care. Log into his computer and read his emails right under his nose, he doesn't give a s**t. And those are just a few of many points that rip me personally right out of the experience and make clear to me that this is just a game with a lot of design decisions that are questionable at best.  CDP is able to make great games, as they've shown with Witcher 3. But they have no talent whatsoever for roleplaying games. Cyberpunk has a lot of potential as a great 1st Person Cyberpunk GTA, but even that will take a lot of post-launch work.  I'll continue to try giving the game a chance, but i'm already close to giving up and just installing Deus Ex again.

First, let's talk about optimization : it's bad : powerful GC can't keep up with this game in 1080p medium settings (for example 1080Ti or 2070). Even in ultra, we can note bad points : textures are all noisy, shadows and lighting are badly handled, creating flickers and weird shadows constantly changing around NPCs. Secondly, and for me the worst part of the game : it's AI. Oh boy, it's catastrophic. The game offers interesting inflitration and hacking methods that are constantly ruined by the AI, as they are so dumb. And it isn't only the enemies, your partners are making your life painfull too. Besides the sad story around it, i'm so glad (SPOILER) that Jackie died, as I hated being around him : he's constantly making sprints around the area when you try to be silent, he just YELLS 2 meters from an enemy you are facing silently, and isn't helping you, you have to make all kills in inflitration. It's better just being brutal, as he at least knows how to shoot, and you're not paying much attention in the AI dumbness in the chaos of a brutal fight, excepted in points of story where you are helped by NPCs that just stands up and wait to be shooted at. Let's also talk about the T-poses, the weird face and body glitches, and lots of glitchs when releasing corpses, as they fly to the other side of the map for no reason, as they were sent with a canon. Story's good, but ruined by a non-immersive world. As I spoke earlier, AI is ruining this immersion, but also how quests are handled : you can make so much choices but you feel you're the only one making them, and your crime partners don't seem to care or ask you questions, as it was showcased on E3 gameplays and trailers, for the exact same missions. So you don't always feel the imapct of your choices or which one are good for your side or not. It's kind of random to choose a approach a mission, as you reall don't know what it's gonna change, no one told you. And the driving... it's heavy, not practical, and you just bump everything in you way. Also, NPC drivers don't pay attention if you just blow their car or transport them over a kilometer on your top, they just serve a generic catchphrase such as ""don't disturb me !"". To resume, you don't feel any impact your behavior as on the city. No one cares, excepted for the cops that pops randomly 2 meters from you for generally no reason, really. The game explains it as a city used to crime, but it's no excuse to make people so lifeless and generic, please ! I'll add little details, like the impossibility of changing the Interact key from F, no Walk key, the game stopping you from leaving Watson district at the beginning by creating an invisible wall on roads... All of this tends to say that this doesn't seem like a 7 years-old developed game. Despites all that, the game have potential. Gameplay's not perfect, enemies are bullet bags, but shooting is pretty cool. Hacking and infiltration could be great with fixed AI, and the city would be much more immersive if people weren't so ""dumb"". I would recommend waiting before buying the game, as you'll just be frustrated by the game by playing it right now.… Expand "

The main story is solid all the way though with good voice acting. The side quests are incredible and actually bolster the main story quite a bit.

As far as PC goes the bugs aren't even bad and most being common types of open-world game bugs we see in basically ALL AAA titles. I can see why people playing on last gen might not be that happy (although I have been told good things about the xbox one X running it) but I also remember when games were coming out for the xbox 360 and crappier versions were coming out for ps2 still (like tony hawks project 8).

Много обещаний, много задумок, да после ошеломительного и прекрасного ведьмака... и вот он вышел, забагованный, урезанный, с глюками, но мы все равно его любили. Такой родной и понятный, из близкой нам культуры. Я всегда был за CDRP, когда все хаяли, мы его хвалили, искали только лучшее. Верили всегда. Когда начали выходить патчи , мы ликовали, я проходил вновь с каждым новым патчем. А потом пришла ОНА, политика. Мне жаль, но любовь закончилась. Остались ненависть и презрение. Позор CDRP!!! I've been waiting years for Cyberpunk to come out. A lot of promises, a lot of ideas, and after a stunning and beautiful witcher... and now he came out, bugged, cut down, with glitches, but we still loved him. So native and understandable, from a culture close to us. I have always been for CDRP, when everyone was blaming, we praised him, we were looking for only the best. They always believed. When patches started coming out, we rejoiced, I went through again with each new patch. And then came SHE, politics. I'm sorry, but love is over. There is hatred and contempt. Shame on CDRP!!! Od lat czekałem na wydanie Cyberpunka. Dużo obietnic, dużo pomysłów, a po oszałamiającym i pięknym wiedźminie… a teraz wyszedł, podsłuchiwany, okrojony, z trzaskami, ale nadal go kochaliśmy. Tak rodzimy i zrozumiały, z bliskiej nam kultury. Zawsze byłem za CDRP, kiedy wszyscy obwiniali, chwaliliśmy go, szukaliśmy tylko najlepszych. Zawsze wierzyli. Kiedy zaczęły pojawiać się łatki, cieszyliśmy się, że przechodziłem ponownie z każdą nową łatką. A potem przyszła ONA, polityka. Przepraszam, ale miłość się skończyła. Jest nienawiść i pogarda.

Its not perfect and its not Witcher 3, but then it was never going to be as Witcher isn't a densely populated city with guns/cars, but I've been impressed with all of the missions, particularly the main story ones and found them enjoyable so far.

The crafting, inventory management systems are sad. The game offers you the illusion of choices rather than actual choices that have any major impact on the story. You will experience bugs/glitches every 2-3 mins......  I can go on and on and on......  Sadly I was a Witcher 3 fan when I went back, I realized that this game is a downgraded clone of Witcher 3.

Riveting and heart breaking in many scenes it shows true emotion from the characters and the followers and friends you pick up along the way.  I am only about 20 minutes beyond Act II, and this game shows great promise, I advise those that are looking at the bad reviews with a 0 - 1 to ignore these fanatic trolls and make your own decision on how you feel about something as this.  In the AAA Game industry, you either like the game or you don't but this does not mean you condemn them for that answer. Story - 10.0 out of 10.0 - They follow the end of Cyberpunk Red and 2020 with a compelling story that holds true to the Book RPG and helps answer many questions in a scenario that left many of us wanting more, and now we have it in a visually inspiring game. Gameplay - 8.5 out of 10.0 - A few glitches here and there make the game have to be reloaded here and there, nothing game breaking or befouling to require anything but a few patches here and there. A great deal of customization, upgrading, skills, perks, and many ways to play and feel like you have the choice, and not geared to going a specific route because the game says so. Sound - 9.0 - 10.0 - Great sound track, a lot of things that feel very real to the era and setting, the combat music, slightly repetitive but can be forgiven slightly as the real sound is in the weapons, effects, and things that go boom!. Handholding - 10.0 out of 10.0 - This game lets you either accept help, or go about your own way of learning, no if ands or buts about it. RPG Elements - 9.0 out of 10.0 - A True, heartbeating, science fiction RPG with all the feel good that goes with it. Its in the same court as Mass Effect 1, a true prodigy of its time, and shows great work by the CDPR going out of their comfort zone to make something as great and spectacular as this title. Replayability - I feel I will play this game as many times if not more than Mass Effect, I mean full runs too, this game shows so much prowess in how your decisions are geared. Branching Dialogs, skill geared dialogs, and many things that have some what Fallout-ish / Mass Effect-Ish feelings and affects as you play.… Expand "

""All roads lead to"" as it were.  * No real progressing your life path just a montage (mentioned above) and things abruptly change.  * AI is non existent.

First the good, the city itself, is beautiful and well crafted, the atmosphere is great but that is it, it is dead, it is lifeless, the NPC are mindless husks with no proper AI(they said that every NPC would have a handcrafted daily routine), the police is even worse, they don't patrol, they don't chase, they just spawn behind in a surprise buttsex attack and that is it(they promised a complex police system), the driving is bad, the shooting is clunky, the stealth is laughable, some perks are useless, the customization is lacking and the genital thing is a big bait, it plays no role at all, you can't go to a barber, you can't have a drink, play a game and many other basic stuff that an open world should have, the lifepaths are meaningless, they change nothing(game clearly is built around the Street Kid background), your actions change nothing.

Now I'm past 80 hours and just gone past the few first story missions.. and the story gets in the way of the game and my way of having fun!? It feel like I'm at a really boring job when playing.. The idiots just keeps calling and try to tell me that their mission is a lot more important than the other idiots that call, and even more important than my char being stuck with Keanu Reeves in my head, and sadly only slowly dying from it.  It feels like the neon painted cardboard walls are about to fall down and only show me the flaws of the game the further I go. the game is not a 10, nor a 9.. it's somewhere between a 5 and a 9.. with the lowest parts being the city itself.. followed by the totally wasted NPC's.  They sit in a car while I'm shooting their windscreen and around their heads.. they don't even blink. Dealing the final blow to their head and walking up to the next car in line.. it's just the same dead eyes. ..and then the cops show up. Outside the apartment i teared up everyone with my Mantisblades, the cops did a full 'Agent Smith' and spawned inside the person behind me. the ..TexMex ..special ninja cops came flashing by.. and I managed to kill them too and hid 5 meters away. The cops totally lost sight of me.. in a damn corridor outside my own apartment?!?!  Seems like the Trauma Team have cloaking devices.. as when I turned around to loot the corpses, they were gone, but not the blood!?  For a game like this to work out, it have to rely on suspension of disbelief.. when the entire house of cards falls down on you at once.. there is nothing left .. not a thing! The city is dead, and populated by dead people..and physics don't really apply..  if you start with that as a main setting, the game might be a full 10.. but start the story and suffer every bug there is and it's not possible to keep playing right now. The replay-ability is really really low, as even if going into the game with the intention to literally burn the city.. it don't really matter, you will never score the lesbian anyway!

The game is absolutely beautiful, and really pushes things forward.  Others, I expect will be fixed or reworked in a future patch.  I don't have a super high end PC, but I can use reasonable graphic settings (medium) I get 100+ FPS, or I can turn on the eye candy and get 30-35 FPS.  Now, 30-35 FPS isn't great, but it is the smoothest experience I have ever had at that framerate.  No stutters, no jerks, just really really smooth at 30 FPS, which isn't something that I expected.  At any rate, I'm about 20 hours into the game, and from what I can tell, I'm pretty sure that I am less than half way through the game at this point.  I expect that my first play through will be 80-200 hours.  I am enjoying the game as it is, but I do look forward to the upcoming patches that fix the glitches that for me so far have been rather minor.  A game crash here, a floating person there, but nothing that keeps me from progressing or continuing to play.  Lots of trolls on metacritic who are obviously trying to downrate the game by giving it a score of 0.  Just look past them, and enjoy the game, you won't regret it.… Expand "

Более того эту игру запускают на 7 и 9 линейке карт! И старых ксеонах за пару тысяч. Можете поискать на Ютубе. В общем киберпанк в очередной раз доказал что даже бюджетные карты и процессоры 5 - 7 летней давности лучше консолей (ну как бы это и так очевидно,ну теперь ещё сильнее надеюсь). Я боюсь представить какая разница будет если они реально допилят оптимизацию, тогда будет вообще тотальное уничтожение! Я играю на gtx 1070 и Ryzen 2700(4ггц), оперативная память крушиал балистикс на частоте 3533мгц,ссд самый обычный. Настройки стоят ультра -  высокие, пару параметров я поставил на средние и на низкие, ибо толку особого не дают,а фпс жрут. На настройки у меня ушло несколько минут. Фпс в районе 38 - 60+ при этом игра работает довольно плавно, резких просадок, фризов и микрофризов нет. Картинка кайф! Играю с момента релиза,не было не одно вылета! Игра куплена в Стиме, стоит 10 винда с последними обновлениями. Гта 5 вообще не к месту в сравнении,эта игра выходила на пс3 и х360. На пс3 там ужас был! На х360 было лучше,но все равно 30 с просадками и убогими текстурами, даже не было травы и мэпинга. На пс4 картинка лучше,но игра работает на 30фпс с просадками до 20 в онлайне! И это паст ген игра для пс4 :) Скайрим вообще не был играбелен для пс3, жуткое мыло и фпс,а со временем сейв вообще крашился и перестал запускаться. Событие с киберпанком далёко не новое. Что касается рдр2,то там мир проще,он красивый да,но гораздо проще. И то в городе там просадки на пс4 были ниже 30. А киберпанк это вся игра город, который ещё гуще и выше!

The only thing I find a bit disappointing so far is the NPC dialogue, I was hoping for a lot more options and decisions that take you on a different path. I was hoping to be able to talk to all the random NPC's that populate the world as well, doesn't need to be anything crazy but something more then a repetitive one liner response would have been nice. Like walking up to a random food joint that clearly sells something and you have no way of being able to interact with it, not even able to sit down if you see a chair can only sit if its part of the quest you doing or in your apartment. Very big open world that tries to look busy and rich, but having such limited interaction with it really breaks the immersion for me to be honest.

I don't know if they will fix AI of police and street npc's, but it's nothing for me, it can't ruin my immersion. But look at this city, it's just breathtaking. Look at the main story, it's really interesting and you believe in what's happening. Read this dialogs they just crazy and cool as they could be.

Чем дальше проходишь тем больше охреневаешь  от того как это сделали. Если вам важен сюжет, атмосфера и отличные диалоги смело качайте. Таких эмоций не даст вам ни одна игра… Expand "

So the story is huge advantage, the characters will also be remembered, they are not generic if I can put it that way. There are some better, some worse side quests. The side activities are a bit monotonous and almost all the same. In general, I can tell you that if the game was not so hyped on the net the production would certainly be better received, apart from the bugs of the last gen console versions. Because it's still a great game, but it didn't live up to the cosmic requirements, and that's probably the problem. If I can advise on CDPR, build less hype around the game, and you'll be better off in terms of image. You won't sell as many copies then, but maybe it's better to save face.  Nevertheless, on PC, I highly recommend the game, patch 1.04 is perfect for my configuration. I'm currently 20 hours in game and I feel that I just scratched the surface of it.

impet25,"Jan 20, 2021",9, Under all the issues and bugs is probably the most next generation game there is. I got about 30 hours in and so far this game smokes everything in the open world genre. Optimization may not be the best and the console thing should not have happened. Honestly they should have delayed the console version. But the PC version is not that bad. 
OverdriveA,"Jan 23, 2021",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I just finished the game. 115 hrs. I decided I will push through this constantly crashing garbage of a game and see the story through, since I've heard it's actually good. It's not. Spoilers ahead so be warned. I've only finished it once and checked the other endings on the web since I thought there's no point replaying the game as the other endings are likely to be the same. And they are the same. There are basically 5 endings and all of them are bad. There's no good ending. All endings are more or less depressing. Some endings give you some consolation for a life wasted away. Others are just pure nonsense. In short, wasted time and money. Disappointment of a decade. I didn't hear one good music track in the game. Dialogs are well acted, but boring. Nothing really grabbed my attention much, maybe aside from Panam story, which cuts short once you bang her. Enemy AI in firefights is terrible. Counter Strike in the year 2000 had better written bots. Car driving is painful. The city seems dead. People walking, cars driving, etc. but there's 0 immersion effect. You just feel empty textures. Factions don't matter at all. It doesn't matter who you side with, nobody cares. The city doesn't react to you in any way, no matter how much street fame you have. No matter if you're good or bad. No matter what is your background. Unfinished product with not much hope of improvement, as it would require years of fixing bugs, adding meaningful mechanics and basic fun to it, to make it good.… Expand "

Hope it will be fixed soon; - Driving. Couldn't drive anything but motorcycle in first person view; - npc are stupid. Fights using quickhucking are too simple and become boring. If you want more fun, go into melee; - main story is too short. I played 100+ hours. And developers made a really good job on side quests. But if I played only the main story, I could complete it in 15-20 hours.  After all, I can say, that the game could be a masterpiece, but it really feels, that it is unfinished. I expected a really long main story, like in the witcher 3 or rdr 2, but didn’t get it. Anyway, it’s worth playing, you can have a lot of fun, but maybe later, when most bugs will be fixed… Expand "

CallenAmakuni,"May 28, 2021",8,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Like with RDR2, let's start with an annex. I'm judging (this is very arrogant, ""giving my opinion on"" is more appropriate) the game, and only the game. I followed the pre-release marketing closely but never expected the soft to live-up to everyone's expectations. And I'll closely stick to the PC version since it seems the console versions were shipped in a completely unacceptable state.  It looks like crapstorms are commonplace nowadays. Sometimes they're justified (Anthem), sometimes not (TLOU Part 2, even if that game isn't nearly as good as the first one and has glaring narrative issues). Cyberpunk is in a grey area in between.  Bugs. There are quite a few. But they never were game-breaking in my experience. A few funny NPC splats, my car that takes a moment to load fully, stuff that you'd usually see in a Bethesda game. It's not great, but I'm usually light-hearted with them as long as they don't hinder my progression.  This is not the game of the generation. Clearly not. Honestly, if there ever was a game that deserved that title, it would be Control. But I digress. It has flaws. Not just one or two. But the game has one quality that shoots it above a lot of other stuff. I'll get into that later.  Now for the specifics.  Pros: - Visually, provided you can run it at medium or above, it looks very decent. Still no RDR2 or Control levels of pretty, but for an open world set in a city fully kitted with neons and purple lamplights, it's nice. I'm a fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, so that may help too. - Night City. A character of her own, she's something that existed before you and will exist after you. You can't interact much with much, but the city has an incredible vibe. Every district feels unique, has a specific atmosphere. Shout out to Japantown and the Badlands, I can go from Blade Runner to Mad Max in a few minutes! - The writing does a solid job. V and Johnny share a rocky and tumultuous relationship that evolves in a natural way, whatever the direction you choose for it. Judy, River and the Peralez questlines were very good. The main quest is decent, not spectacular but clearly above average. There is however one side questline that is a pure gem and that is... - The Aldecaldos's quest chain. I couldn't not mention them, hence the Spoiler warning. Good Lord. This questline has a soul of its own. I would have eaten up an entire game of just hanging out with that broken band of MadMaxy misfits. I played a Corpo V and chose an ending that made his story so powerful it overshadowed the main quest. Like, how? They poured their heart and soul into this. Panam might be the single best-written romance option (the word 'option' here is important) in all gaming. Everything about them feels human. Coupled with that ending... It raised this game from barely above average to frankly memorable. - The soundtrack is badass, but I'm ironically not a huge fan of electro music, despite loving the GITS-inspired visuals. Even with that, I enjoyed quite a few songs and battle themes. - The gameplay is also serviceable. It's nothing stellar, but it doesn't hinder the experience either.  Cons: - The gameplay, again. While it's okayish, it does feel a lot like an open-world Deus Ex, with less options to reach our objective. Branching paths were a big deal in promo stuff, and I felt like I didn't have a lot of choices anyhow except for the few missions they decided to promote. Balancing was another issue: pistols and melee weapons are literally broken. My revolver could one-shot anything as long as I was stealthy, even on Hard difficulty. I'm not asking for torture still, but maybe tone the damage multipliers down? - Bugs. As discussed above, annoying sometimes, funny most of the time, but still not really a feature to be proud of. The game needed a bit more time. People seem to forget that TW3 was shipped in a similar state a bit too often though... - NPCs. They are indeed kinda lifeless. Empty husks that just exist to look cyberpunk-y. A shame. - Driving. Just, no. Nope. That's not how cars work. -  A few quests have no real closure. I get that it is a cyberpunk setting and sometimes people just ghost you and/or disappear, but I'd have liked to know what happens to that mayor candidate, even if it's bad...  Seeing these lists of pros and cons, you might wonder why I give this game an 8, when I gave RDR2 a 6 for example. I'll be honest here, the Aldecaldos questline and everything that has to do with them (which is a quite sizable part of the game when you think about it) struck a chord within me. I know, it's very personal, but this is my review.  This might not be the game you were waiting for. Actually, it's most probably not. While I do believe TW3 is a bit overhyped, it is a better game, objectively, and by far. But I enjoyed Cyberpunk overall just a bit more.  Does a game need to be the best to stir the best feelings?… Expand "

If you can't get a PS5 (which most cannot at this time). I don't have the PC version, but I'm sure you need the specs, which include similar technology i.e. display drives.

The load time takes a while, but that's b/c the board on the PC is slow. If I had a PS5 it would zip things out. Display and graphics are fine, you just need to configure the settings.

Pixel-perfect textures? You got it. Real time ray-tracing? Sure thing. Super detailed character models? Every single NPC has it. CD Projekt RED did an amazing job coming from The Witcher 3.  Sound: Love or hate Cyberpunk 2077, you can't deny the fact that this game has an unmatched soundtrack. The audio fidelity is impecable and the soundtrack is as good as titles such as PAYDAY 2 or Hotline Miami.  Story: It's a tale as old as time that CD Projekt RED writing is amazing and this time, it's no different. Memorable characters, interesting events and a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish with the story, I'll even admit, I cried a river when I got to the credits.  But enough horsin' around, let's adress the elephant in the room. Is Cyberpunk 2077 an unfinished game?  No, far from it. It's an incredible experience that can be enjoyed from start to finish. Does that mean that the game is polished? No. Unless you have an enthusiast level PC (10700K/5600X with a 3070) you're going to have to sacrifice some of those settings, that doesn't mean the game won't be enjoyable, but it will be looking worse than it should.  The framerates are stable, however. Once you find your sweet graphics settings spot to hit 60FPS you probably won't see it dip unless you do something really extreme. There are other issues that need addressing, LODs taking too long to load and dissapearing NPCs are the most frequent for me, but there's plenty of other things that need fixing, hopefully, they will be in due time.  Cyberpunk 2077 is like an unpolished diamond. It may be rough around the edges and unpleasant to look at times, but it's still a gem.… Expand "

As for frames.. it does drop bad in fights and textures do take a bit to load which is annoying. Hopefully it will be patched. But honestly this is one of the better RPGs I played in a long while, the story is amazing the dialogue( I like how everything is voiced) the side gigs and well the loot I’m actually quite addicted to this game. I think it’s absolutely fun! I can see this game being amazing with a few patches and probably can go down in history with the modding community on PC. This game really brings that blade runner/fifth element kind of feel, the world is gross and full of adds how I imagined a cyber world would be. I think if it had a much smoother launch this game would definitely be one of the best out there!… Expand "

Let me preface by saying the hype surrounding this game was PROFOUNDLY retarded. W3 is still their best game. Gotta understand though, Witcher was never their own original idea. They had a wealth of source material to stem from and use as a crutch. These guys are no 2nd coming of OG BioWare I enjoyed my experience with Cyberpunk because I didn't really have expectations per se. As far as GOTY is concerned, I don't play enough new releases tbh I only played this because I was genuinely intrigued by the setting and Keanu Reeves's involvement, and the fact this was allegedly an RPG Bugs and glitches were negligible for me. 2 crashes in 300 hrs, pretty consistent 45-50fps even on my GTX 1080 on ultra settings, which I'll consider marginally ""acceptable"" for a somewhat poorly optimized new release. I anticipate performance will improve over time with patches, etc. And both crashes were essentially my fault from excessive reloading, save scum farming legendary loot for hrs on end. I'm surprised it didn't happen more often Lol Basically this game ran better than 99.9% of other **** I play, especially the overrated Bugthesda trash Lmao Storyline is top-notch quality, they really nailed the writing, it's so on-point, and the dialogue trees are ample (I still find myself reloading often, but I like the color coding), though it heavily relies upon Keanu Reeves's presence. I've had a blast playing it tbh. I love that it dabbles in the philosophical realm, concepts such as free will, the self, human condition are explored in painstaking detail, etc. But yeah, there's a lot of superficial fluff, it's distracting. Some of the design choices were plain ludicrous.  - No vehicle or clothing customization. - Extremely limited romance options, essentially 1 or 2 depending on orientation. - Blocking access to a ripper doc just for punching the **** was stupid. - They didn't really deliver on the nudity thing. Pussied out as expected - You can't even see yourself naked really outside the menu and sex scenes, mods have been way better for years. It's not even close - Not having 3rd person perspective seems a little amateurish imo. I enjoy immersion except when it comes at the cost of fun and practicality. It's a very CDPR game. - The atmosphere is palpable, but the city while breathtaking graphics wise is sterile and lifeless, barely any NPC dialogues.  These guys are great storytellers, but they kinda suck at the world building in the literal sense. They did a good job foreshadowing/complimenting certain quests in other regards through various in-game TV, radio and media however They have incredible ideas, shame they can't realize their open worlds like Rockstar (the world is the most important and underrated character and nobody does a sandbox better). R* is a jack of all trades. They're good at everything, especially crafting authentic intricate worlds with very sleek gameplay, which is exactly what makes their games so ridiculously addictive, fun, timeless, and replayable The actual world in Cyberpunk is maybe a cut above your average Ubisoft copy/paste gameplay loop **** The criticisms of the lifepaths were a little unfair... considering there's a ****load of unique dialogue options. What did people expect? 3 separate versions of the same story revolving around a **** colossal game? And your choices do matter, even on a quest by quest basis, sometimes down to a specific line of banter determining whether you successfully romance a character or side quest chain ends or continues. The **** you say in convos actually matters or changes things for once Some aspects could have been fleshed out more, properly, sure I'm obsessed with acting, writing, storytelling, so even if everything else is somewhat lackluster I can appreciate the sheer ambition. The hype around this game was absolutely **** retarded to reiterate It's almost exactly what I said pre-launch verbatim. Hype couldn't match up with reality. If they didn't make the best game ever disappointment was gonna be inevitable For sure, it's not the best game of all time in the annals of history, but it's still a **** cool worthwhile gaming experience, and I think that's really saying something these days Lol Ultimately... Story was good, everything else was mediocre. There's literally dozens of games that do stealth, gunplay, combat, melee, driving, open worlds, RPG mechanics, better than this. It's more of an action adventure game with RPG elements tacked on CDPR kinda sold out in record time as I predicted like 6-7 years ago before W3 came out, strayed away from their roots, so I can totally understand why people are pissed. And I believe the story would have been underwhelming and suffered too without Keanu Reeves elevating everything Overall, subjectively just based on my personal experience It's a 9 in my book, objectively, realistically, it's more like an 8.… Expand "

Life paths have no meaningful impact on the game, they add flavour dialog and a couple of unique quests and do not majorly alter the game as was promised. Dialog choices are more illusion than anything as they lead to the same outcome.  The AI is bare bones, in combat enemies will just sit there while you take your sweet time head shooting them, police spawn out of the thin air and don't react to gun fire from gangs shooting over their heads. theirs’s no police car chases either. No bounty hunters, max-tac coming after you. They simply can't chase you in vehicles and have you noticed there are no other bikes on the road only in scripted events.  Crafting Is imbalanced and unrewarding. You can craft clothing mods from basic components and disassemble them into more advanced components. somehow you can disassemble consumables like soda drinks and craft high tech weapons from them which makes zero sense.  Upgrading weapons only offer a small increase in damage and becomes ridiculously expensive. when upgrading legendary weapons you use very expense components for an extra 10 points of damage etc. This feature was meant to allow the player to keep their favourite guns but is not even remotely balanced for this.  Hacking is overpowered which is not helped by the dumb AI and the minigame itself becomes very tedious.  The perk tree is all over the place. some give 50% extra headshot damage while others give 3% extra damage. a lot of the icons don't match what the perk provides. it is full of padding. One perk disassembles valuable junk together with the common junk costing the player 1000's in money. Skills should add interesting mechanics and abilities.  Driving is a mess, the POV when driving first person is messed up on a lot of cars you can barely see over the steering wheel. breaking is almost none existent. Some time you are blinded by daylight when driving first person, this is more common in the Badlands.  The arm augmentations which where advertised as game changing like gorilla arms allowing you force open doors is no longer a feature though the item description is still there.  Inventory is a nightmare to organise. It would have made more sense to find the gun with a standard skin and allow the player customise it ourselves. Levelled guns and armour means you are constantly changing guns I think I spent most of my time going through my inventory. Late game rare and epic guns drop all the time which makes them feel common and not like epic loot.  Bugs everywhere, T-posing pedestrians, car drivers, in cut scenes etc. floating cigarettes, guns, frame rate drops. Cars driving through wall, sliding nps in cutscenes. Dead still talking to the player, dying when jumping down 4 feet, dropping off the top of ladders. grenades not been thrown when pressing the button.  I could go on but the main thing is this game is not what CD PROJEKT RED promised and is an average game.… Expand "

Moreover, the multiple choices that you can make in the game, make it very enjoyable to play since you decide ""to a degree always"" what is happening.

I am docking the game by a point because of the number of bugs and missing systems. it is true that the AI is nothing to write home about but I have seen worse in recent games. I like to try and match this game up against my all-time favorite pc game Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines. Both games are based on tabletop RPGs and both games launch with a massive amount of bugs. Cyberpunk 2077 is lacking in new systems like appearance customization after you start the game and a more in-depth background system as we saw in the 2018 e3 demo. Though hopefully yjose could be added later. The lawforce system is also kinda disappointing as the police just appear out of nowhere at times. Though none of these affected what I was truly after in the game. The three best things I think both cyberpunk and vampire did well was the writing, the story, and the characters you meet along the way. Night city is also an amazing character itself. The design and look of the city is breathtaking. I also really enjoyed the badlands outside of night city. A lot of these characters in the game that you do side quests with feel real and make the city come alive. I think CDPR knocked it out of the park with the art and writing but it could have used more time in the oven to expand systems and fix bugs. I think they should have done what rockstar does.

BUGS & LAST GEN The game has a few buggy problems(although I haven't seen any yet) and it is not optimized for last gen consoles, I don't understand why this game was even released on last gen consoles, this is clearly a 2020 generation console game.  LOOTING The only thing I don't enjoy that much in the game, is the crazy amount of guns you can loot in the game. The problem with this loot system is that you are in your inventory for a big amount of time comparing stats and mid maxing everything. The upside of this system is the variety of ways you can play the character, but IMO they throw you in the deep end to quickly, if it was a bit more paced it would be better.  STORY AND SIDE MISSIONS I can't say anything about the story yet after 15 hours of playtime I just finished the prologue where you are introduced to the character of Johnny Silverhand. The reason it took me about 15 hours to get there is because I am enjoying all the side content the game has too offer. The side stories are interesting and also rewarding in my eyes, I am also enjoying the bounty hunting you can do very early in the game(although it is not explained how to start in the DATABANK(tutorial list)).  COMBAT The combat can be quite fun, the only problem I am finding is that I don't know why I should bring a melee weapon into a gunfight? Perhaps later on there will be enemies I can only kill with melee weapons, but up until now I don't see the use of melee weapons yet.  CONCLUSION Although it is a 8 or a 9 in my eyes, I am giving it a 10 to counter-review bomb, I am dissapointed to see so many give this game a 0 after all the backlash the studio got for delaying the game multiple times. CDPR should have gotten rid of the idea of releasing this on the last gen, and maybe another delay of 2 or 3 months would have been better so that the console players can play it on next gen when the next batch of consoles are ready for shipping.  This game is gonna be a 9 atleast for people when all the bugs are fleshed out, so if you are still on the fence right now and you don't have a beefy pc. Wait  2 or 3 months,… Expand "

Really well-written dialogues, very likeable. + The soundtrack bangs! Really never expected the soundtrack to be so good. (But feels more Skrillex than Cyberpunk.) + The RPG systems are technically a good upgrade from The Witcher 3. + Night City (if it works) is a gorgeous place. The open-world geometry makes it even more better. The verticality is just amazing. The anti-symmetrical geometry and engineering of the city structures is so good. + Side missions are good, but forgettable. + Gigs are serviceable. + Keanu's voice acting is meh.  Cons: (oh boy! buckle up for this one!) - The lies, the misleading marketing, the sweet fu*king little lies!! Why? (edit: The E3 2018 Demo is fake.) - 25 promotional/marketing videos, including 13 trailers (btw you can check on YT) is totally unacceptable for any product or hell, ANYTHING. Night City Wire. Oh boy, is it the most atrocious way of marketing a game. - The ""Lifepaths"" are very, very disappointing. They barely affect your game-play. I went in thinking it would impact as how Dragon Age Origins did. They give you an extra dialogue, which is nice but barely makes a difference in the overall narrative. You will go through a 10-15 min brief prologue that's rushed and bridges into a montage and makes you a Street Kid. - Some characters aren't fleshed out well. Left me a bit to be desired. - The clothing in this game.. The less said, the better. - You cannot customize your character once you've done with it in the beginning of the game. There's no purpose of customizing V's gentiles. You cannot customize V's car, apartment. Weapon customization could've been a thing in an FPS game!! - The audio design is dog$#!t. [Maybe a bug in the in-game mixer, but its very bad!] - Night City is beautiful, but it has a disproportional amount of sex shops. The sexualized ads are overwhelming. Just too much! And has the most uncomfortable sex scenes in a video game. - The open-world at times feels pointless. There's nothing to do. Nothing innovative. - The ""branching narrative"" is total BS. Its non-existent. The game is linear asf. - The endings are not satisfying whatsoever. - The dialogue choices are also stupid and useless. They are as shallow as Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War's. [You'll have like: 1. Yes; 2. Yesser; 3. Yessest; 4. [Street Kid] Hell yeah! 5. [Corpo] Yessir. 6. [Nomad]. Ohhyahh!!] - The perks are very uninspired. just percentage boosters. Here's a perk that gives 5% of more quicker erection! - The in-game economy is a joke. There's no resale value at all for in-game items. - The NPC and Police AI is non-existent. This was a problem in The Witcher 3, but its more prevalent in Cyberpunk 2077. The routine NPC AI and corrupt police is all lies. The AI is not even up to Xbox 360/PS3's standards. - No variety in enemy types. - The loot is non-sense. It's as bad as The Witcher 3. (WTF am I supposed to do by looting ashtray or a used condom cover.) - The vehicle physics are bad. - The gun-play is a chore in the initial part of the game. As you acquire perks, it will be better. It would feel like almost you have played two different games, and that's not how it should work. The weapon sandbox can be both good and stupid. Melee weapons is a joke! (except the Mantis blades) - The game is buggy asf! It ranges from funny small bugs to game breaking ones. Its also an unoptimized mess. My PC (not the latest and the greatest) could hold it up to 30-50 fps on 1080p Med/High. The game has a lot of draw distancing and level of detail issues. The game is on life-support thanks to DLSS. But, if you own a GTX card, good luck getting the game on/above 60 fps.  All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is sure as hell not a bad game, but not a good game either. The Todd Howard level lies just made it worse. This game wants to be everything, a Grand Theft Auto-style open-world, a Fallout style FPS, Mass Effect style dialogue choices, a Witcher 3 style branching narrative, a Borderlands 2 style loot, a Ubisoft game style filler side missions, a Dragon Age Origins style ""Lifepaths,"" and that's just not possible. In try to do the best game, CDPR has failed in doing the fundamentals that aren't up to PS2's standards. The fact that the demo turned out to be fake, really hurts. Unfortunately, the game feels like a poor man's, watered down version of Far Cry than any of the games mentioned above. I'd give it a 6.5/10.  I'd strongly not recommend to buy this game right now! Let the game get its patching work done. It very much feels like an early access game, only its without the ""Early Access"" indication on the store page. Wait and patiently wait.

I will preface by saying that the Witcher 3 is my favorite video game of all time, so I might be a little biased to CDRP. When I am playing a game, the question I always ask myself: am I having fun? And the answer to Cyberpunk 2077 is a resounding yes. The first few hours are a slow-burn, but once you get past this, you are presented with a game that is incredibly layered, complex, with what seems to be an entertaining story (at least it is 10 or so hours in at this point). Good graphics, characters, voice-acting, etc., everything you would expect from a CDPR game. What is not being talked about enough is the music. Music gets a 10/10. Normally I don't focus on the music too much in a game, but they nailed it here. I'm talking Hotline Miami quality music that really fits the Cyberpunk setting. That being said, the game is far from perfect.  The combat is okay. It can be a little chaotic with how detailed the game is, and many times with so much going on on the screen, I had no clue what was going on and the AI isn't great (although, the computer was able to flank me a handful of times).  Performance has also been a huge controversy surrounding the game. Playing on the PS4 Pro, I definitely have noticed some performance issues, but none have been game breaking. Sometimes while driving, the game will ""glitch"" for a few seconds to get caught up, the visual of a weapon will be missing from my hand, etc. However, for me, this was to be expected for this type of game, or really any massive open-world game. I would say the technical issues were about the same, maybe slightly worse  for me, as Valhalla. They are present, but nothing game breaking. For these reasons alone, the game gets an 8 instead of a 10.  For everyone griping about the games performance on the base PS4 or Xbox One. What did you expect? This game was released right as next gens were, and any game this ambitious was going to push the current gen consoles. Anyone who expected this game to run smoothly on a base PS4 is being naive IMO, and I had even heard pre-release that this would probably be the case. We, as gamers, put CDPR in a no-win situation. We demanded a game that pushed the limits of gaming and what current gen consoles could handle. I am sure people would be upset if they dumbed the game down to work perfectly performance wise (wait, you're saying we waited 8 years for this?!?), they could have made it only for next gen consoles (people would have lost their minds over this), or they could have delayed again to patch it more. Considering that the devs already received death threats from the last delay, we as gamers made this decision for them.  I think we need to take a step back here and realize the impossible demands the gaming community has put on CDPR. Yes, they are partially to blame for making this ambitious of a game, but the demands the gaming community have put on them are unrealistic and unobtainable. There is never going to be a perfect game, but I think that was what was expected from Cyberpunk 2077. Again, if you thought a base PS4 or PS4 Slim would run this game smoothly, that was naive, imo.… Expand "

The situation on last-gen consoles can be very different.  This game is one of a kind and masterfully crafted if you know what to expect. It is not an online game and not your typical GTA style running and gunning. It is unfortunately not as technically polished as people thought it would be, which is a shame because everything else is just so good: the music, sound, lore, weapons, animations, cars, characters, and more.  Story-telling and roll-playing are the two main elements here. There are plenty of dialogue choices based on your life-path. You can choose the type of character that you want to be and act like one, which opens up distinctively different options of play-style, like stealth, sniper, hacker, engineer, or tank. Although the AI is rather basic, you can still get killed quite frequently if you do not manage your stats, gear, and approach. The stealth system is nothing fancy, but it works and does provide a fair amount of challenge.  In terms of graphics, this game has set a new high benchmark. There is no equivalent game to-date with such a high level of attention to details and insane density. With ray-tracing enabled, the world is unbelievably immersive and beautiful. Yes, there are graphical glitches here and there occasionally, but, overall, one cannot deny how good the world looks.  People giving it a zero score are likely blowing off their frustration with the technical issues of the game. This massive art-piece, which is a result of many years of work, is not even out for a week. Some have waited 7 years for this game to become a reality, so I believe you can wait a bit longer for CDPR to iron out the bugs too. Even with the imperfections, this game still packs a punch.

Ещё раз в час можно найти неоновую вывеску и она будет с тёмной полосой, будто бы сломана, но вблизи она абсолютно нормально работает, т.е. это баг, но это не то что портит настроение. Ещё момент: враг стреляет у обрыва, после прокида гранаты он падает 2 метра и его телепортит обратно. Обзор врагов реалистичный, можно стоять на дистанции их внимание чуть рассеяно, но тебя не игнорируют. В бою тебя видят только если сам даёшь себя показать.  Не слушайте поехавших про безжизненный открытый мир, взаимодействие с обычными ботами не имеет смысла ни в какой игре(у фанатов the sims, конечно другое мнение..). Но при этом можно увидеть как кого-то избивают хулиганы или прессуют банды. Копы стопуют рандомных пешеходов и завязывается диалог. Часто можно послушать, как кто-то что-то обсуждает. Иной раз диалоги настолько орные и жизненные. Один из них по памяти:    *парень клеется к девушке* Он: Ну давай, чего ты стесняешься? Она: Слушай, сегодня мне не до этого, отвали Он: Так ты стесняешься Она: Ох, ебать ты тупой...  Бесподобная проработка сеттинга. Много годной авторской музыки. В игре вагоны качественного рукотворного контента, но люди просто смотрят на рандомные баги, не замечая прекрасное. Потому что не видят прекрасное -> не ассоциируют себя с прекрасным -> привыкли кушать каки, потреблять не лучшее, а новое. Пройдёт время, пофиксят ерунду с фонариками и тп, люди купят нормальное железо года через 3-4 и оценка будет 9.5-10/10.  Ставить 1-3/10 - быть учительницей, занижающей оценку за почерк и ей неважно: работа уровня Шекспира, Пушкина, Анджея Сапковского или сценариста последних AssCreed. Думайте сами: за что ставить оценку и что ценить в играх.

All the various effects like volumetric fog and clouds and the FULL ray tracing suite (reflections, shadows and ambient AO - which has only been implemented once before in that combination in Control) play incredibly well with the neon filled, lively streets of Night City. It is a sight to behold. All this has to come at a cost, obviously. I can say that on remotely good hardware this game is a delight that delivers in terms of story, setting and graphics. It is the first game that gives you a preview of what the term ""next gen"" truly means. There are just so many little details that the developer just didn't necessarily need to implement, stuff that the player wouldn't even have noticed was missing, i. e. certain facial muscles twitching during dialogue that makes npcs look more alive or ""anxious"" breathing patterns when they are under threat or hurt.  I feel sorry for all the people who delusionally thought this would be an ordinary game. It's been pretty clear for 2+ years now that this would be the next ""Crysis"". Many reviewers said when they saw the og gameplay from 2018 their first thought was ""no way will this run on og consoles"" like duh? And you can't compare this to Playstation exclusives or games from Rockstar. They both spend a significant amount of time and ressources on optimisation that cdpr, which btw has only been in the AAA business since the surprise hit Witcher 3 might I add, simply doesn't have access to or experience in. Just use your brains before buying games people and do some basic research. And if you don't like it just return it. Nowhere on the packaging does it say that you are entitled to play this game in high fidelity. The game isn't so much unoptimised as you 8 year old hardware is begging for the sweet mercy of death after what you're putting it through. Period.  Secondly, the complaints about the games delays where tremendous. The developers themselves said they had to BEG the publisher for those final 3 more weeks. What is it - do you want your game NOW or do you want it to be finished? Neither is right. Just chill out and trust a developer that needs more time. YOU are part of the problem.  Also can we stop pretending that it is at all even remotely possible to release games or any piece of software in perfect states? Financing requires early announcements, hype and preorders. That's simply how it works. All the armchair developers spreading rumours about the issues are insane tbh, most of you don't have the slightest clue what is going on behind the scenes or why mechanics work the way they do. I don't either in most cases, and I don't claim to. Games are getting increasingly more complex, and this game is a technical marvel on a scale never seen before despite it's issues. On top of that, CD Projekt Red already has commited to improving the experience and adding missing features.

The only problem I have so far is, that you can't change the visual appearance of your character in game after you left the character editor. There no barber, tattoo artists or piercer in the city. You cant even change your makeup. So at least right now you really should be 100% sure about your V before you start the game.… Expand "

To sum up my review when the game is working and running properly it is absolutely breathtaking. especially if you take the time to do some of the side missions to help further connections with some of the characters.

Certainly, some of my expectations did not meet reality, but they do not diminish the accomplishments of CDPR and its dev team on this game. Bugs are present, and perhaps a new release, focused on an early 2021 launch, would do the game much better and present it to the world as it should have been: the most ambitious game of this generation, a deservingly ending for it. However, they do not interfere with gameplay, and as they give the game a feeling of ""unfinishedness"", it still manages to achieve what it has set to do. Note, however, what it has set to do is not necessarily what some people would have expected from it. Marketing was misleading, indeed, and yet, the more serious and rational conversations surrounding the game were realistic. That came from the community, not from CDPR. Those folks in the community, I expect, were not disappointed in the slightest, perhaps if so, only by the bugginess still present even with the 1.04 patch. Once the game is finished, however, it will feel 100% as it's supposed to, not just 90%. Still, I shall not engage with the negative reviews here seen. Believe me when I say it: There is absolutely no way you can evaluate this game that's not above a 6,5/10 score and still make yourself out to be honest. And trust me, you'll only get that score if you overinflate the issues, and diminish the achievements, which might as well be personal taste, but can too, be dishonesty and perhaps a tad of personal bitterness. Take note, the achievements heavily outweigh the issues. As CDPR continues working on Cyberpunk 2077, I expect it to become the most highly-achieving product of the later 2010s. Expect DLCs to be amazing, and patches to be incredible. However, CDPR needs to seriously rethink its strategy, how they deal with the public, how they manage hype, and how they manage their own projects and employees. Certainly, this game is not deserving of a Best Director award. Nonetheless, the dev team has made it a gem of the most precious kind, even if unpolished for now. Still, a couple of features are missing, but not those that people usually complained about. The game does not need car customization, it does not need more apartments, but it does need in-game character customization. Which is odd to lack for such a game. Now for the positive: everything else. CDPR has gilded the genre of RPG with Cyberpunk 2077. The dialogues are extremely good, and the quests and story surpass even the highest possible expectation. Characters are deep, complex, and feel real. Night City feels real, a living, breathing gigantic organism that is indeed a character in the game. The game is rich, feels alive, and feels like what the next generation should be about. Other companies making RPGs are seriously in trouble now if it's expected of them to achieve the standard CDPR has set with Cyberpunk for this new generation. Without spoiling, this game will take you to places you never imagines possible from the beginning, and you'll be at the edge of your city. As always, hang in there for the prologue to finish, once it does, you're in for the most delightful treat gaming could ever offer. The sometimes overwhelming options and possibilities are easy to get used to, and once you set a path for yourself and your character, the city becomes the scenario of your most ambitious project for fun. Filled with surprises, details that cater to everyone, Night City is for you, but also not. It's for everyone in its own way. Cyberpunk is the next step towards RPG, and it dared not taking a step only, but a leap. A leap that fell short on landing, but is still the world record so far. Go on, take part on that leap yourself. Feel the wind against your face, and the adrenaline rush you're definitely going to have. Beware of the landing and the initial bugs and glitches, but do note, however, that they do not make it any less amazing than what it's set to be. Be prepared, have a decent rig, and dive into this amazing achievement by the team behind its making. Don't worry, you'll love it.… Expand "

Yes cyberpunk is currently pretty buggy and I couid understand if people want to wait till that's patched to buy it. But at least in the 30 hours I currently have into the game nothing has been bad enough to really effect my experience or ruin my immersion. I've never once crashed to desktop and haven't been forced toI'm really not sure if I understand a lot of the reviews on here. Yes cyberpunk is currently pretty buggy and I couid understand if people want to wait till that's patched to buy it. But at least in the 30 hours I currently have into the game nothing has been bad enough to really effect my experience or ruin my immersion. I've never once crashed to desktop and haven't been forced to restart once. Now I'll go over what I think is the best and worst parts of the game. Pros: -Night city feels full and vibrant. People have mentioned it feeling empty on here, but that wasn't my experience at all. Busy areas of the city have so many npcs that you have to push through them and the few completely desolate areas were clearly designed to be. There are things to do and quests all over the map and they all feel interesting with their own stories. Though actually I think there's a setting for npc amount so it might feel more empty on a weaker system. -Hacking. Watch Dogs was designed to be focused entirely around hacking and I find cyberpunks system much more fun and enjoyable. You can interact with objects to distract enemies, cause explosions, or take control of them. You can also hack people with the quickhacks that you collect which can do anything from large amounts of damage to moving them around to disabling their cyberware or blinding them. Intelligence feels like a very worthwhile stat that can hold it's own in combat. -The graphics. Lot's of people are saying it's super ugly and I think that's entirely unfair. Yes it looks better in some of the trailers like most games do. But it's still one of the nicest looking games I've played. And the aesthetic perfectly fits the image of night city. - The characters and quests. These are beautifully done. I've never felt more immersed in a game. The writing is great and all the quest characters feel real. There are funny moments, sad moments, incredibly dark moments, and they're all done incredibly well. - The cyberware. Each upgrade I got felt like a noticeable and interesting upgrade. Double jumps, time slow, hovering. The mantis blades and monowire were especially fun. Cons: -It's definitely buggy. Like pre USLEEP skyrim buggy. But none of what I've run into has been anything more than annoying. If bugs really break your immersion and you want the best possible experience though I recommend waiting. -Guns. It's more like a looter shooter than I would've hoped. Don't get too attached to anything because you will have to change it out. -*Crafting. I can't personally attest to this since I didn't spec into it, but I've heard that the crafting system and economy are basically broken. I guess as a final conclusion I think that cyberpunk is suffering from being hyped beyond reasonable expectation. I personally love story based rpgs and they're my favorite genre so I love this game. Despite the flaws it has it's quickly becoming one of my favorites if not my favorite game of all time.… Expand "

The only thing that I would like to improve the variability of the plot and possibilities (it is impossible to kill some NPCs in secondary quests, like in Skyrim, etc.) and more beautiful special effects, such as fire and physics of destruction of cars, which either do not exist or they look weak, but this is not a reason lower the grade.

There is a very good game at the heart of Cyberpunk but it is buried under a deluge of padding, poor AI, an archaic loot system, and bugs. You start the game by customising your character and choosing a lifepath. Appearance and gender affect your romance options while the lifepath gives you one of 3 introductions along with differing dialogue options down the line.  Once the intro is over, the 3 lifepath stories coalesce into an engaging story about a Mcguffin biochip, weaving in and out of the major Cyberpunk themes. As a fan of the genre, I found the main story and most of the side quests to be fascinating and the most engaging parts of the game. Unfortunately, there are a lot of preriferal objectives and activities surrounding the quality missions that weigh down the experience as a whole.  The map is plastered with icons that represent activities of varying quality. Unfortunately, most will see you going to a location and killing some people with little context beyond ""they are bad guys"". These activities will be framed by soulless phone calls and end with money and exp materialising in your pocket. It is blatant padding, present to give the illusion that Night City is a place where stuff happens, while in reality there isn't much going on at all. At a glance, the city is gorgeous, sporting all of the neon and mismatched architecture a Cyberpunk city should have. Yet the inhabitants of Night City are mostly mindless drones. Seriously, the AI of pedestrians and drivers is Driver 3 levels of basic. Pedestrians have a stock crouch animation when things get violent and there seems to be no variation in their responses to your actions. The most glaring routines are those of the children. They wander around, unaccompanied, doing nothing. In the Witcher 3, kids would play tag, kick around in the mud and gawp at Geralt's swords. Why are these kids now so emotionless and why are they all missing their guardians?  Things only get worse when you start driving. The only response other drivers ever have is to stop their vehicles and beep the horn. Park your car slightly off the curb? Cars will stop (even when there's space to go around) and beep their horn. Crash into a van at 120mph, they will stop and beep their horn. Shoot at them.. they don't really do anything when you do that actually but you get the idea. I am not a huge GTA fan but I have to admit, Rockstar nails pedestrian AI. Seeing the various reactions of crowds is one of the many joys an open-world city can provide. Without it the world feels so superficial.  This feeling extends to the available cars too. Cars cannot be customised and are pretty much just a cosmetic option. Yes, they have differing speeds but the layout of Night City does not lend itself to fast driving and the car controls are average at best. This wouldn't bother me too much, but flying cars are present throughout the game, so it's pretty galling that you never get your hands on one or customise an existing car to fly.  As an RPG there is also an in depth levelling system. There are over a dozen perk trees to fill out with the general buffs and upgrades you would expect, like increase health or do more damage. You can also buy upgrades like a rocket launcher in your wrist which is very cool, or a quickhack that sets enemies on fire. It is a typical RPG character progression system, it works well but it's not groundbreaking and the UI needs some work. Aside from character progression there is also loot which is handled very poorly. The game drowns you in weapons and clothing but most of it is useless. Throughout the game I have encountered about 6 guns that I actually use, these are ""iconic"" guns that can be upgraded. Despite this, almost every mission will end with my inventory being stuffed with a dozen new (weaker) assault rifles and pistols. The constant routine of running back and forth to a vendor is exhausting and the kind of thing we all had enough of in Skyrim, almost a decade ago. Similarly, you will frequently discover an entire new wardrobe. There are lots of cool clothing items in Cyberpunk but each of them has an arbitrary armour number so you will spend the majority of the game wearing a stupid mismatched outfit to maximise your armour.  The gameplay itself is very basic FPS-RPG action. Bullet sponge enemies are frequent and your options are usually just stealth or kill everything. I enjoyed it, but the AI is simple and quickhacks are never as impactful as Geralt's Signs were.  If you like the genre of Cyberpunk and have a system that can run it, you will love this game. If you are looking for the new benchmark for Open-Worlds you will be sorely dissappointed. I can't wait to see what CD Projekt red improves over the next year but as is, the open-world element of this game has glaring flaws that we have seen in dozens of lower budget games before it.… Expand "

Cyberpunk 2077 has everything you'd expect, and that's about it. Nothing really new and interesting. I dragged myself through the ending of the main mission which was left in the air. This game offers multiple play throughs and different life paths, but honestly I don't see myself playing this again. Perhaps with future updates it will be something worth investing more time. I'm happy I experienced this game, it's not all bad, there are some amazing playable cutscenes, the vehicles look awesome to be Frank. The city's design is pretty cool for the most part, but it still felt underwhelming, there are plenty of NPC's, but overall this game feels entirely half baked. The writing is decent, but the overall story was interesting at first but my story's conclusion was lame and left in the air. Dialogue isn't as in depth as I hoped, with few dialogue options that don't actually affect the plot, but offer a bit more lore or information. Cyberpunks main missions are by far the best part of the game, as underwhelming and fragmented the story is, there are some cool missions that really suck you in, only to be let down by the rest of the game. Side missions are pretty generic, find stuff, kill people. There is plenty of clutter in Night City to waste your time. Overall it's well polished, but a turd nonetheless.… Expand "

On my not the most powerful computer (gtx 1080, i7 4gn, 16gb ram, ssd) everything works quite nicely - at maximum settings without RTX ~50-65 fps in the city. In general, I like the game (in some places very much). I hope we, gamers, will accept it positively, forgive the Reds for some of the jambs and look forward to further development.

Bad, I know.  Right now, the game sits at an 8, but during the following weeks, the game is going to get patched big time. If those patches completely change the game, open every gamer's third eye, reveal the secrets of the universe, and then make every pill-pusher this side of the Appalachian Mountains hold hands and sing kumbaya, I'll give it a 9. For now, it'll just sit at an 8.  This game isn't perfect, which is why it sits at an 8, but when it shines I'm staring at solid gold. People have been complaining that there's too much dialogue, but people also loved the Witcher 3 and Red Dead for that. People have complained that there isn't a whole lot of choice in the dialogue, giving them only 2-4 options in most occasions. These are also the same people that praised the Witcher 3 for the exact same thing. I've played a ton of RPGs: Divinity (1 and 2), Wasteland (2 and 3), every Fallout game, Elder Scrolls games, Atom RPG, Dragon Age- a lott'a the good stuff new and old. CD Projekt Red doesn't really make RPGs in the classic sense, they just make RP-lights. Is that wrong? No. The game was advertised as an ARPG with choices and such; similar to the Witcher franchise. Is that not exactly what we got? What did you want? 30 ways to say yes, no, or maybe? We didn't get a garbage-fire system like Fallout 4 and we didn't get a perfect system like New Vegas. They worked with what they had in terms of having two simultaneous voice actors (male and female) for each given line and allowing players to give V their very own personality. The writing in the game is insane. It's engaging, the dialogue is realistic, the romance scenes are actually endearing instead of making me want to rip my eyes out and find them a new home in my blender like AC Odyssey did, and there wasn't a moment of it that I wasn't interested in what was happening next.  All of your choices will impact some part of the game, but not all will impact the ending. Every choice is recognized. As long as they're not brushed off, it's fine. It's about the journey, not the destination. Too many games focus on saving the world and involving you in a plot that you couldn't care less about. This game takes a much different approach and puts you into a story only comparable to the best in the business. Keanu Reeves made this game a million times more engaging for me as Johnny Silverhand and V's relationship is one of the core pillars of this game. I can't say anything more about the story and writing without spoiling it, but just know that if you're there to be entertained, you will be entertained.  The gunplay is fine. It feels tight and smooth like your mother. I don't have too much to say on it, as it is no CoD or Borderlands, but it serves the game fine enough. The melee combat is atrocious, though. Your camera spins around like your head is on a swivel and the dodging mechanic just doesn't work. Your own hit box is broken and this is very clear in the fight club questline where your opponent will punch you from 10 feet away and slice your health bar in half. I'm assuming this will be fixed in a patch, but for now, I'm just avoiding the final fight because I don't feel like resorting to glitches. The driving is good in the lower-end cars, but when you get to faster ones, it feels very slippery and a bit floaty. I'm assuming this will be fixed in a patch. The city itself is the most complicated I've ever seen design-wise. However, in terms of its inhabitants and how deep your interaction with the city goes, it's a bit shallow. I'd compare the interaction-level to the game Sleeping Dogs, because funnily enough, Hong Kong isn't too dissimilar from a dystopian hell-scape 57 years into the future. However, in Sleeping Dogs, if you pulled out a gun people would react in a frightened manner. This does not happen in Cyberpunk. If you get into an altercation with the police, you can do a bunch of crazy high-speed chase stuff in Sleeping Dogs, and there is- at the time of this review- no open-world police chases in the game. Police will teleport behind your character until they get a reasonable distance away and lose their wanted level.  Needless to say, this is pretty embarrassing, and takes a point away.  However, the city itself is the best ever seen in a video game. It surpasses every other game in sheer scale and beauty, and that is because the city is built upwards, not outwards. A true Cyberpunk fantasy.  Cyberpunk 2077 is a buggy masterpiece that needed some more time in the oven. I only hope that its reputation is not forever stained, because it is the Witcher 2 of this franchise. They have gotten the formula down, they just need to expand upon it in the next game.… Expand "

Outside of being a backdrop for the story, the city has nothing to offer.  Hacking is unfathomably boring and simple for a world that revolves around the Net and netrunners.  The gameplay loop gets stale after a mere few hours.  Outside of the main story, there's only a small hand full of decent quest lines that are interesting -- 95% of the side missions are MMO-style fetch quests that involve going to a location, killing 3 enemies and looting a crate.  The vast majority of the NPC interactions you experience in this game take place answering phone calls from strangers offering you jobs & 25 text messages every few minutes asking you to buy a car that is conveniently placed in a parking lot for you to approach.  It's honestly baffling how this level of quality and blatantly missing features / content + the amount of bugs has received anything higher than a 4 or a 5 from critics and the audience.  This doesn't even feel like a CDPR game, let alone a deep, rich RPG that was going to set a new standard in the open world RPG genre like they had promised back in 2012 when they announced this game.  Such a monumental waste of an incredible IP and setting.  Hopefully CDPR can do what's needed to turn this mess around, although I highly doubt their investors/execs will see the value in that.

Могу часами ходить и рассматривать все. Сюжет так же восторгает, дико интересно за ним наблюдать. С не малой заслугой все это и от персонажей. Их характеры, образы, их жизнь, мысли. Как же к ним привязываешься и переживаешь, когда что то случается. А как все это поставленно. Такого точно от огромной рпг в открытом мире не ожидаешь. Все их микро движения, мимика, ну дико реалистично, а что ещё больше удивляет, что каждый персонаж двигается особенно. Геймплей по началу кажется простоватым, но потом это опять восторг фаната жанра. Взломать с десяток людей и заразить их, расстрелять из автомата, с подкатом вынести из дробовика, опять при этом попутно кому то поджарив мозги, вытащить катану, клинки богомола или струну и прыгнув метров на 5 убить врага.

Very unpleasant :( sometimes even the intonation, etc. of those speakers is not in the topic. But if the developers had an idea to cause disgust for Russian speakers - then they succeeded :) I hope for the possibility of changing this voice acting to an adequate one, for people, and not only for connoisseurs of bazaar, hair dryers and purulent bad breath. It's strange why they bypassed the opportunity to add Ukrainian localization, because there are many voice actors in Ukraine and they are much better than the Russian ones you picked :( Despite all this, the game is a MASTERPIECE! with your participation! thank you for the impression!

The story is great and the characters are amazing and well written, however I did sort of have an issue with Keanu's performance since he didn't really do his best this time. The gameplay is decent enough for it to be passable but it's not enjoyable at times since you can stick to one weapon and upgrade it so it would basically kill enemies in two hits which that isn't really balanced. Another issue with this game are the missing features. You can't customize your car, no police system like GTA, storylines are not different from one another, and interacting with random NPCS. Overall the game is a buggy missing features mess but the only thing that keeps it from getting a 5/10 or lower is the story, characters, and the immersion when the immersion doesn't break.

It seems the haters always compare the game systems, to the respective best in their class. So a lot of complains turn up. Police/Ped AI isn't as good as GTA. Stealth isn't as good as Dishonored. etc....  I have to say I agree, yes the game is not as good in certain systems as the games that were basically best in that system, but there is NO OTHER GAME that offers me this experience in a single package.  I did not experience ANY game breaking bugs, I had a few weird & funny glitches, but I'm sure they'll be patched out.  I can just say i do not get the hate.  I got exactly what I expected and there were very few games that I had as much fun with as this one.… Expand "

Cyberpunk is rare in this regard, as rare as it is uneven; Conversations that drag to infinity, until the music picks up and empty words start to have a little zing. Characters blowing up your phone like Hiroshima, until you play certain missions that allow you to get to know them. Tons of upgrades and cool hacking abilities, but with no real reason to invest in them.  And a story that want to breath, but is suffocated by jerky, stop-and-go progression and too many characters popping in and out with no rhyme or reason.  Then there's V. A guy (in my case) who's  as confused as the player; getting jerked around by everyone he comes across, unable to make heads or tails of anything. Where did he come from? What does he want? What is he doing at any given time, and why? Questions the game can't answer, because it's too busy throwing everything it's got at the player in the most uncoordinated way possible, and then doing nothing at all. Leaving the conversations to keep the momentum going on their own, which they usually fail miserably at.  Where is the energy? Where is the forward momentum? Where are the critical moments where the player takes charge and the protagonist comes to life? They exist, but only as high-points along a largely passionless journey.  It's too bad. This game has so many great ideas, and some of them come to fruition, but Cyberpunk 2077 fails to bring them together with enough calculation, consistency, and determination to make the game's inner diamond shine to it's maximum luster.… Expand "

The side quests open a bit more variety but still very rigid. They game plays best as an open world action/adventure game rather than a full RPG. I'm in love with the game. The characters are truly wonderful, going through the story with these people and seeing how they evolve over your short time in Night City is truly incredible. I wish romances were a bit more than just a sex scene for the most part, but that's not too big of a deal. The combat is a little better than good. Guns feel responsive and punchy, but recoil feels a little inconsistent. Swords are just fun to build out and go crazy with and the body augments add a special flair to the game although I wish they were more integrated into combat rather than just a separate dedicated weapon. Driving is honestly a bit annoying. Cars don't feel like they're on the road, it's like you're always on a layer of ice or oil and you just can't get the car where you want it unless you go really slow. Overall the gameplay experience is enjoyable, it misses any revolution to the genre but does everything I'd expect as well as it can given the bugs. The game has consumed over 50 hours of my life in just a week. That being said, if you don't have a good PC, a strong desire to immerse yourself in the dense streets of the future, or a want to play a more rigid RPG experience, then waiting might be best for you. The game has a lot of flaws and bugs and missed promises and that's gonna be hard for a lot of people to overlook.

Vorlost,"Dec 13, 2020",4," TLDR: If you look at Cyberpunk 2077 without the whole CDPR Hype-train marketing, it would have been a pretty good Action RPG with a decent gameplay, superb written characters and a really good story, would rate it 7/10. The promises CDPR made are simply misleading, so many of those aren’t kept, therefor I can´t give Cyberpunk 2077 more than 4/10, even if I still really enjoyed it.  CDPRTLDR: If you look at Cyberpunk 2077 without the whole CDPR Hype-train marketing, it would have been a pretty good Action RPG with a decent gameplay, superb written characters and a really good story, would rate it 7/10. The promises CDPR made are simply misleading, so many of those aren’t kept, therefor I can´t give Cyberpunk 2077 more than 4/10, even if I still really enjoyed it.  CDPR promised us a futuristic world, where the player defines the way he wants to experience Night City. Your choices will slowly form your path to the biggest legend Night City´s ever seen or maybe something else?  First things first, THE STORY: The story is good, but the character synchronization and the facial animations are just superb. After several hours in game you start to get attached to certain NPC´s, doesn’t matter if it´s Johnny or some other NPC you´ll met on your journey. If you´ll talk to a friend you can see and hear in their voice when they’re scared, you can see their emotions, this is Cyberpunk in its prime. The missions in general are well thought through and diversified.  PATHING/DECISION MAKING: Most of the time you´ll pick a decision, just to find out in the next moment that it seemed like it wouldn’t even matter what you’ve chosen. Often dialog options are just different versions of yes or no and you can’t really impact anything but just smaller events. Of course there are these big moments where you have to decide how you would tackle a big job, but in the end the result is always the same, just the journey there vary (result may vary also a bit e.g. If you decide to use option 1, character X dies at the end of the mission, if you use option 2 character Z dies, etc.). It’s always that particularly sour taste after taking certain paths because it just feels too irrelevant to actually change anything.  For mission pathing it’s a bit different, but also no revelation. If you´re into melee combat, try breaching the front door and have some fun. Love hacking? Try to hack your way through enemy lines by deactivating their optics or distract them (distracting works 95% of the time, so it’s basically your bread and butter on every spec tho) Prefer sneaky? Skill into cool and move in and out again like a shadow without anyone noticing.  Everything plays a bit different but in the end it’s nothing too special. Ofc. you can combine the above mentioned to mix it up a bit but won’t change anything dramatically.  CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: The character creator is basic, you can pick different presets for certain parts (eyes, nose, browns, hair, and so on), pick your first attribute points and start with a life path. There is no way to change your character afterwards (no barber etc). At last pick your first attribute points, your origin and here you go.  During your playtime you´ll lvl up and get new points to invest. The skill system is good and there are loads of interesting skills to choose from. Your attributes will also let you make certain decisions e.g. you can only open a door if you have body 8, having int 6 gives an additional dialog… (95% irrelevant…) Crafting feels pretty underwhelming, tried it out once, never used again.  GEAR/CYBERWARE: Armor is more or less just there, stats aren’t that impactful therefor my focus was looking good while beating my enemies to pulps. Cyberware got me much more interested. After the trailers with those mantis blades I really wanted those. A Ripperdoc visit later and after investing all my hard earned money, I went to town to **** **** up. Well, they’re pretty lame. Not like they´ll do no dmg, but having about 3 normal and 1 finisher attack animation simply doesn’t make the cut (especially when the finisher move takes about 3sec and you can still get shot in the meantime, complete disapointment) Btw: The gorilla implants aren’t needed to open doors, simply put enough points into body and you’re good to go…  THE WORLD: Night City and its surroundings aren’t too huge compared to a Witcher3, but so rich in details that you can lose yourself just walking through the streets. Your playground is big enough and versatile that I never used fast travel once during my 45h´s.  GRAPHICS: I played on a GTX1080Ti in 1440p, everything on High/Ultra, just a few things lowered to Medium and got a pretty solid performance (40-50fps but V-Sync).  BUGS: I had everything, most of the time just minor things, about 5 times game crashes or forced to reload.  CONCLUSION: I really enjoyed the game but I can’t silence the voice in the back of my head asking “Is this it, this is the great Cyberpunk 2077 that we´ve been waiting for the past 8 years? This is the game CDPR sells us after setting the expectations so damn high?” I can’t feel but disappointed in this game and especially in CDPR marketing, this isn’t the Cyberpunk 2077 we were promised.… Expand "

Lifepath: So much emphasis was put on the importance of your ""lifepath"" choice Nomad, Corpo, or Streetkid. But it becomes painfully obvious within the first 30 minutes of gameplay that the lifepath simply does not matter as you are all working on the same main story. Besides a few additional ""special"" dialog options your ""lifepath"" has ZERO impact on the gameplay. This ""feature"" seems more like an afterthought than a primary selling point...  Quests: The quests are good. I feel like there is enough content to keep most people occupied for at least 60 hours. The Lore is detailed, you can read many little ""shards"" in game to find out more about the world. There are also plenty of Eastereggs which give you a nice chuckle from time to time.  World: The world is large and detailed. The layout of Night City mostly makes sense and it's an overall beautiful environment to ""play"" in. (more on that later...)  Gameplay: Ohhhh boy... Here we go... The AI in this game is a complete and utter joke. The NPCs don't have ""daily routines"" unless it means pacing back and forth sitting down on a bench from time to time. The Cops show up out of NOWHERE and there is no ""wanted system"" besides wanted and not wanted. (Think GTA ""Star System"", yea it DEFINITELY doesn't have THAT) If you kill someone you'll be notified that the police have been alerted and then seconds later they spawn randomly outside your field of view. If you simply run away your ""wanted status"" just disappears. There are no long lasting repercussions to your actions in the world. (Other than your quest dialog options) Cops don't even drive cars, so there are also no police chases. The AIs do not care if you steal from them. (Even in The Witcher 3 this was a ""feature""). You can't really customize anything beyond adding some ""mods"" which are not even visible on your weapon or armor and simply add some arbitrary stats to your item. (Besides a scope and a silencer...) Vehicles cannot be customized so it's a ""you can have it any color you like as long as it's black"" situation. Day and Night cycle has no impact on game-play, neither does weather. (There are no environmental hazards)  Overall: The game has no content outside of the questing system. There are no meaningful player - NPC interactions and you never fully build a ""relationship"" with an NPC. The game feels as ""Wide as an ocean and deep as a puddle"". As soon as you leave the narrow path that CDPR sends you on you realize the game is just empty.  If you are expecting a beautiful futuristic GTA V made by the creators of Witcher 3 then STAY AWAY!!! FAR FAR AWAY!!! Because it's not that... I am having serious buyers remorse with this game... Which is sad because it had SO MUCH POTENTIAL.… Expand "

Here are the main issues from someone who pre-ordered, loved the Witcher series and really wanted this to work: 1. The city feels vapid and empty despite NPCs - they just wander up and down - the same fat guy with the waddle with different clothes, the guy with an itchy shoulder with different clothes. The same gangs, in the same areas. The police who appear out of thin air, but also lose interest within a block of drivingrunning. 2. Sure a lot of houses you entered in TW3 were samey, but at least you could go in them. In CB2027 you simply cannot go into many buildings in the city, you are kept almost exclusively on the street until a particular mission. The lifts in buildings only go to the floors related to your current mission. 3. There is no real progression of my character, other than some stats. I cannot upgrade my apartment, or move. My car is what I buy or get as a reward - no customisation at all . Even with Roach I could add a new saddle, trophy... 4. They didn't keep the mechanic from TW3 where the character you are following will match your speed. You either are slowed to a walk, or if you break out of the ""envelope"" they run after you! 5. You jog everywhere, you cannot just walk, which makes point 4 weird! 6. It is clear that the more open nature of missions was cut from earlier demonstrations - remember Meredith, they showed you scouting it out with Jackie - which makes more sense with the conversation with the guard about whether you are alone. 7. Sick of the breaching mechanic after the 50th time. 8. 90% of conversation options have zero effect on the outcome, and in many cases how they respond to you.

Main story is very good, and also, side quests are massive. with only Only one side quest chain, could easyly make a whole game for 6h of playtime like COD or any EA product. So, what about bugs... well, i had only one game braeking bug, it killed one o side job (not side mission) and thats it. Few minor glitchs, nothing more. I played on RX 590, 32 gigs of ram (u  could have only 16, no diferents), and Ryzen 1600x on medium settings (50-60fps), and boy... medium looks better then any other game i played on ultra. Additional thougt: That PC cost me around 800 USD 2 YEARS AGO! This is not PCMR class of hardware, its cheap af... pls dont claim u need 2,3,4, or 5k PC to run Cyberpunk... There is many ppl that have problem with this game, and... i honetly dont know why. City looks real AF, AI maybe isn't best on the world, but still, its okey. Remember, this is not shooter, its not call of duty. This is mainly Role Play Game. Vehicles are OK, if u hate handling, just adapt, learn how to drive in this game. IMHO CP77 have superiur car handling then other games, specially if u drive heavy vehicles. u can almost feel the weight. Collisions in the other hand are **** that is something CDPR shoud fix. Overall, Cyberpunk is very strong RPG game, with immersive city, best graphic on the market, really well made storyline, awesome side quest chains, and i cant wait for DLC's As i said before, cant even imaging why people hate's this game.. Maybe, just maybe, these gamers, just dont like RPG games, or maybe its PS4/XBX port... Anyway, im glad that they screw up optimalization on consoles, and didn't downgrade the graphic quality (yes, im talking about every single ubisoft game since FC3) CDPR, thanks for this awesome adventure, im looking for more from CP77 in the near future.

Szponixx,"Dec 14, 2020",9," I've played 60h of Cyberpunk 2077, finished main story line and all major side quest. Let me tell you - this game is grand.

Let me tell you - this game is grand. Yes, I know that there is that ""controversy"" related to bugs but I can assure you, on PC the game is solid. From y experience, this whole thing is highly exaggerated. During my 60h playthrough the game haven't crashed even once. And only two times I had to reload the save because some mission objective would not update. Just two times during 60h! People who call it ""a buggy mess"" clearly just want to cash in on YouTube views or article clicks. Listen to your fellow gamer, you can play it without the doubts. You will enjoy it. The most common ""bugs"" that I noticed are graphical ones. Sometimes NPCs are T-posing far away, at the edge od field of view. Sometimes, also at the edge of field of view, cars jump up in the air. You can also encounter some NPCs clipping into the road or a wall. Nothing really major. To be honest I think I would not even notice those bugs if I wouldn;t be focused on looking for them. Those minor bugs are the reason I'm giving this game 9/10. I can imagine someone might be more irritated with them and score the game at 8/10. But the truth is, everything below that is just straight up unfair. Now for the good parts: Night City - it's the most realistic city you will find in a video game. The scale, the ammount of people, there's something happening on every street. Sure, im most cases those are just very similiar activities, but those make sure you have a feeling the city lives. You can;t just go from point A to B, something will happen while you do that. The whole city design. It had to be titanic work bringing this thing to be. For me the city is another character in this game. It will chew you out and spit you out. It's a city of dreams but those dreams usually end bad for the citizens. Characters - expect nothing less than in Witcher 3. When you finish the game, you will feel that feeling of emptines and nostalgia. The same that you have after finishing good book. Victor, Misty, Panam, Judy, Kerry, Evelyn, Rogue, River, Us Cracks, Johnny and so on. You will make friends, you will care about them. They are not perfect, they are not there just to bring you the joy and not for everyone of them there will be happy ending. But that's what make them feel real. Story and side quests - there's a lot of simple quests, called ""gigs"" that are more or less just a generic quests: go there, steal this, kill someone, hack something. But there are also some of the most mature quest you will ever experience in a video game. They will ask you questions: what it means to be alive? Is your personality and body the only thing that makes ""you""? Can you live without the soul? Is AI truly alive? What does it mean to be free? Is it worth to chase your dreams? Gun fight is great, especialy in a late game once you unlock certains skills, get proper implants. Hacking is awesome. I even liked the melee. You just need to get gorilla arms to have fun out of it. There are some other aspects of this game that I could write essey about but I'm not very good at it, so I won't. Just know that this game is a lot of fun. Just like the Witcher 3. It's different in many aspects but at a core it's the same. A game created with love. And because of that it's sad that both media and YouTubers jumped on that ""controversy"" band wagon, trying to make a quick cash. This game does not deserve that. You can play it right now and you will have a great time. You will get emotional, sometimes sad, sometimes happy but you will have that feeling that you are experiencing a great adventure. And I hope that after CDPR fixes those bugs that I mentioned, and both media and YouTuber won't have any more ""issues"" to exaggerate, the game will be recognized as one of the best game world ever created.… Expand "

Story is amazing , I like the overall topic and execution of that topic. A little bit too short for me but CDPR said it will be a shorter game than Witcher 3. Nonetheless the short story doesn't help to bond with characters imho.  Characters are well created , with their own interesting backstory and problems. Immersion is a hard thing to achieve because of bugs and glitches. World is smaller than I expected and this is one of the biggest downsides for me. Sometimes it feels really real and alive and sometimes it feels like a bad copy-cat of some GTA . Now to more gameplay and mechanics stuff. I want to point out that shooting from guns and overall use of weapons feels really good , especially if you consider that CDPR never done FPS before and they used for this game their own engine. The same thing applies for driving in CP77. Cars are different and are made for different terrains. Many cars have a problem that while driving at high speed they tend to act like a soap in a bathtub. (irritating but not game breaking) and there are some weird bugs in case of calling your car or hitting some things with your car. In the case of AI and NPCs , there are a lot of unfulfilled promises , that's the second biggest downside for me. They are just stupid with IQ of a room temp. I think it can be patched out but the problem right now is just the overall numbness of NPCs/AI and their reactions to what the player is doing to them or around them.  Let's talk about something that is executed by CDPR perfectly , that's graphics. The quality of textures , reflections and lightning is breathtaking. Adding this photomode was a great decision from CDPR. I found myself just stopping and taking some shots. Actually taking photos was more distracting from the game than the bugs itself. Faces of characters are very detailed , clothing is great and looks almost real. I also really like the overall design of implants , and vehicles. Interiors of cars are really well created and once again detailed. Every place and scene in CP77 has their own little things happening , it's full of everything and details. Amazing how CDPR perfected the imperfections of location they have put in the game. Also I wanted to say something about interfaces. It's very minimalistic and fits with the topic and climate of the game but i have few objections. Minimap is really small , too small. And I don't mean the window of the map is small , the amount of content it shows is just too small. I really often missed a turn or didn't see where I should go. An Implant interface is really nice , like how it shows you a x-ray of your V and the way it's all presented. I was slightly disappointed when the changes I made did not change anything with this visualization of the human body. Maybe devs will add it , but now they have a much bigger problem to solve. Overall equipment interface is clear and easy to use. The only thing missing for me is weapon preview.  There were plenty of situations where I just kept switching scopes because they had some weird color and didn't match the rest of a gun. In case of skills and skill-trees , CDPR went wild. 5 different trees , with 2 or more different sub-categories. If you're worried about if your style of playing is implemented in game , there is a big chance it is.  There are plenty of quests, you won't be bored if you like to stop and do stuff. I have one negative thing to say about main story quests. I feel like there are just a few. Too few. This is connected to my problem with the length of a game and it makes sense why there is this amount of quests but still , after the first time playing I was baffled by how fast the main story flew between my fingers. I also would divide side-quests into two types. One that has behind them a long and interesting quest line and the other that are much shorter but still have some interesting and funny stories.In short , if you don't plan to speedrun CP77 and just explore the world. Now i wanted to say something to all those people that just cry how cyberpunk is a bugged and awful game , worst in history and other **** like that. First , it's pretty childish to base a ""review"" not on the actual game but on your feelings. If you are mad at CDPR for not keeping all promises , then go back and stand in line. I'm also mad how the game isn't a revolution in the gaming industry and how CP77 is unpolished/bugged in many ways. And I don't blame you for being angry , I blame you for being angry just to be angry. The moment when ""gamers"" started throwing rocks at Death Stranding for cooperation with CDPR , that was the moment I realized , you are angry just to be angry. It's sad to watch how CDPR is drowning because you just need to scream and cry about the game that promised everything gave you ""only"" a lot. Peace and happy playing.… Expand "

zechs3,"Dec 15, 2020",9," This game has an unprecedented level of detail and love.  A truly great developer respects your time and intelligence, and ultimately gives you more of the writing and stories that compel you to continue and invest your time in the game.  That's the biggest thing this game brings to the table.  Simple side quest in Cyberpunk could be the story arc for a lesser game.  But it's not justThis game has an unprecedented level of detail and love.  A truly great developer respects your time and intelligence, and ultimately gives you more of the writing and stories that compel you to continue and invest your time in the game.  That's the biggest thing this game brings to the table.  Simple side quest in Cyberpunk could be the story arc for a lesser game.  But it's not just the writing... the areas of the world you'd never have a reason to visit have obviously had care and love put into them.  That said, the game is structured very similarly to Witcher 3 in the future. The side quest, and random encounters are all there, with the quality turned up a notch or two.  Regarding bugs there are plenty, you'll see one every two missions.  Most of them are harmless (items you can't pick up, a partial reflection in a window) some are worse... I had to play through a quest 5 times to get the enemies to spawn correctly.  I still love the game, it's like dating Beyoncé but she wants you to be vegan, you'll work around it, it's not a deal breaker.  Perhaps worse than the bugs is the performance, I would not play this game without a RTX 3080 or better... CD Projekt absolutely pushed the graphical envelope, but it doesn't come cheap.  To make matters worse the cards are only available at a mark up.  This is extremely frustrating but not the developer's fault.… Expand "

Just gotta say my piece, never done this before so bare with me.This games incredible, bugs are bad this games basically 3 or 4 years early. That being said, even at this point the games a work of art.Think about games like skyrim, oblivion, fallout, etc. This game pretty much makes them all. Completely irrelevant. Cp77 as a fragment of itself embodies a soul none of those games could ever achieve, moreover it's just plain. Cooler the entire timd.First off context: I'm one of those 2000 hour monster hunter, soulsbourne ng++++++, type of gamers. At 100 hours over two playthroughs this game has replayability in spades,  when the 3rd person mods come  it's a flat 10. Ever want to play Ghost in the Shell, leaping across an entire city skyline + badlands, u cant camo but u can jedi mind trick entire city  blocks in literally the blink of an eye. Ever want to explore the anime city of metropolis, or be a **** mad max wastelander but with realstyle?Maybe you wanna be **** Satan and watch (through the walls) as an entire  military encampment catches **** techno-covid, bursts into flames, and fire upon each other in straight melee while you sit on your Akira bike.Maybe you wanna be cp2077 solidsnake cqc'ing the world taking down targets silently , maybe you wanna be the ninja  from thatsame game. Hell man you can just get stuck crafting and the game still rewards you in appropriate and significant  ways. The writing is stellar touching  on real issues, and questions I'm sure many peoe are uncomfortable  asking themselves. Honestly  that's what these mediums need. they need content that pushes thinking forward .  Look honestly I could probably go for awhile,   about the things this game does right, but I just want to get back to it tbh , just ask yourself this....would you nail christ go the cross if he'd asked you to?How many times have you been posted that question. A.i is buggy and bad, I've had 2 crashes and numerous optimization like collision, and t posing etc.  Vehicles feel distinct same for weapons optimization issues hamper them tho all very  good just clearly needing that last year or two of quiet development I'm honestly  conflicted about playing it early because it's so good but optimization  would've allowed for a homogeneous experience  for everyone else.

The only really annoying bug was the lod  low polygon charachters some times after loading the game because I've installed it on a hddd (like the consoles so even with the really slow iw hdd setting.. It still has issues with mechanical drives even if mine is faster than a console ). Still I had and I'm still having plentiful of fun. I actually thought I woukd hate the combat but i feels fun. Driving might be  needing some improvement. The story is suoerb too but it felt kinda really short. Even with side quest many times.

There are unique items along with legendary craftable options, and combat feels thrilling along with stealth and hacking. The world is simply put incredible, it varies and you can see so many interesting things, might just walk or drive down the street and have fun without even interacting with the world. So many little things added that spice up the game, and hopefully more will come. Thank you CDPR developers. There are tons of reviews here written with unreasonable anger by console users, people who never played the game, and people who can not play it since it requires strong/expensive computers and consoles and maybe people who had imagined the game would have even more features.

Khapri,"Dec 16, 2020",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Ok well I think I'll just get the negatives out of the way real quick. The game does have quite a big bug problem, but for me personally I haven't ran into any bugs that have in anyway ruined my experience so far. I've only had a single crash and this is with me having around 90hrs in the game.Besides these issues, the game has generally ran pretty well for me. I don't have the most powerful pc set up, but I am still able to run it a stable framerate that is playable. Visually the gane is absolutely amazing, I was just blown away by the amazing work done by the devs. You can really see the hard work put into creating night city.The soundtrack to the game is also just amazing, some of the best in any game that I have played. My personal favourites have to be; Never Fade Away, Rite of Passage and Been Good to Know Ya. Some beautiful pieces of music.Now for the story and can I just say wow. It really blew me away. The way the devs have managed to make you care about the characters so much on an emotional level is really impressive. The story telling and dialogue is really well done and I feel like compared to other games humour has been done really well too. I won't go into too much detail, but the story is one that got me really emotional, especially depending on the ending you choose. It has a very realistic feel to it and the devs certainly don't hold back with making the story almost soul crushing. But not necessarily in a completely negative way.The side missions in this game are honestly just as amazing as the main missions, some more than others. They don't even necessarily even feel like side missions due to the amount of effort that has been put into them. So once you do complete the main story, don't worry there's more than enough missions still afterwards.One of the things I began to really appreciate during my time playing the game, especially the side missions, was the hacking and stealth side of the combat. The two work really well together and make for a satisfying experience. That being said going guns and blazing is just as fun lol.All round I think this game is incredible and despite it's current issues with bugs and last gen I really hope this whole situation is sorted out and look forward to this games future. I would also like to just say thank you to the devs and every other single person involved in this game. It has to be one of the greatest gaming experiences I have ever been part of. Everyone involved should be really proud of this work of art.… Expand "

Сюжет хороший, хоть и сама сюжетная линия не такая длинная, как хотелось, на все концовки, кроме одной можно выйти в самом конце, это и плюс и минус, но для каждого свое. Геймплей хорош, нетраннерские фишки хорошо вписываются, хотя под конец это также не важно, как и в третьем ведьмаке играть становится слишком легко, даже на максимальной сложности(на которой я и проходил игру). Ладно, тут можно писать до бесконечности, но главное, что я получил незабываемые ощущения от игры и с нетерпением жду DLC и продолжения, такие ощущения я получал лишь от Witcher 3 и Dying Light. Очень грустно видеть нули от людей, которые даже не играли в эту игру, или их 950 не потянула ее. А, ну и консольщики, которые всерьез возмущены тем, что на их корыте 2013 года игра выглядит плохо.… Expand "

It is still fun to roleplay though.There are currently plenty of glitches, but most of them are hilarious rather than annoying.

They live and breath and make you forget that they’re only pixels. The superb writing is done an incredible service by the animations, which are hands down the best I’ve ever seen. From hair, to body movement, to micro facial expressions, each character lives and breathes with their own personality and quirks. You can literally tell if a character is jumpy or lying or depressed just via the animations and how they look at you suspiciously, or scoot back in their chair, or nervously bounce their leg. None of it feels fake or uncanny valley. It feels real.The city as a whole is visually stunning, inside and out. Every building and interior feels fresh and unique and perfectly tailored for the setting. Each neighborhood is alive with their own culture and energy.NPCs are all uniquely designed. and their little side conversations and motivations add incredible depth and color to the world. Night City breathes. Little details like monks having scars from removed cyberware... random mugging victims thanking you for saving them... returning to a store you drove scavengers from to see shopkeepers have moved in. All outside of missions, just there while you wander around the city.But the missions are excellent too, down to the most “minor”. There are no mindless fetch quests or busy work--everything is varied and detailed and has its own story to tell. And those stories explain not just that particular mission, but more about the Cyberpunk world itself. This is a game that shows rather than tells, and it does it superbly.Level design is among the best I've ever seen. There are so many ways to go about getting in and around buildings, from parkour to stealth to just breaking down the front door. No load screens or waiting. It's seamless.Combat likewise, you can play so many different ways, and they are each effective and each feel real. They start out rough because V is rough, and they grow with you throughout the game until you feel almost unstoppable in the end. I’m in my second play-through and this time I can do things in a completely different way to how I did them the first time, so much so that it feels like an entirely new game. Yet both ways were powerful and both were fantastically fun. This is not a game where you will always end up a stealth archer.That’s not to say there aren’t flaws. There are some visual glitches and clipping issues that need to be fixed. Spawning likewise, though unless you make a point of looking for it it’s pretty easy to ignore. I had to reload a save once or twice because something prevented me from finishing a mission. The mini-map is too tight so it forces you to make (and miss) last minute turns. I wish there were more romance options for subsequent play-throughs, because the ones that exist now are outstanding.But none of the above in any way stopped me from enjoying the game.I know there has been a huge outcry of negativity since the launch, some of it deserved. But I truly hope that people give Cyberpunk a chance, and go in with an open mind and experience it for themselves for the game it is.No, it doesn’t have the police AI of GTA. It’s not meant to. In Night City the police don’t care, so they wouldn’t bother to chase you down. It’s not GTA.No, it doesn’t have the total lifelike immersion of RDR. It’s not RDR. In this game immersion means becoming invested in the story and the characters' lives, and coming to care about them like you would a real person. Judy and Panam and Takamura and even smaller characters like River and Claire and Misty and Mitch are right up there with Garrus and Tali and Mordin as some of the greatest characters I can remember in gaming. They don't even feel like characters, they feel like people.No, it doesn’t have the vast, wide-open choice of Fallout or Skyrim. It’s not a Bethesda game. Those games give you endless freedom but they’re also forced to be pretty shallow because of it. This is a game that is deep rather than wide.No game can be everything to all people. GTA doesn’t do what Fallout does and Skyrim doesn’t do what RDR does. GTA6 and ES6 are being built on mountains of experience, yet they’ve been in development for longer than Cyberpunk 2077 has even been imagined. But for some reason people expected this game to be able to combine all those ideas and systems that other studios have refined over decades, merge them seamlessly, in an entirely new IP and engine, release it on time, and have it be flawless and completely bug free. At some point the reality of game development has to come into play. You pick and choose what type of game you want to make and then prioritize the elements that best serve that game.That is what CDPR has done. They are known for rich, story-driven games, and in Cyberpunk they have created a spectacular one.… Expand "

Your character- V is fighting for one more day, hour and you certainly can feel it as the game progress.  Main quests are so good that every one seperated can be made into a movie for example stealing biochip from Yorinobu. Side quest are also great and can make you forget about main story, because some of them are more like main quests itself. CDPR for sure knows how to write a story. But there is also a dark side of the story, your choices doesn't influence the city and relations with characters on the level developers announced. Furthermore the romances are sort of **** up. You just do couple of missions to bang someone. That's it.  The climate of NC is just how it supposed to be. You can feel those dirty streets, corp influence and constant fear for your life. On the other hand AI in this game is something to be patched because NPCS as well as enemies are just stupid. Music, graphics, humour is just as we all expected from studio like CDPR.  For me gameplay is great. Shooting feels real, you have to deal with recoil etc. I wasn't the type of ninja so I can't tell much about being stealth. But driving is much harder than in other games. Although it feels more real because you certainly cannot turn if you are going like 140mph. From my expierience game doesn't have many bugs. The most common bugs were all kinds of items stuck mid-air like cigarettes, food, drinks etc. Overall it's truly revolutionary expierience and I think patches will surely make the game a 10/10… Expand "

From what story there is, it is pretty good but what it was meant to be it is vastly inferior when compared to Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 5, and choice consequences of Wasteland 3 in which it was striving to be.  The music and score is amazing and ebbs and flow with what the world is.  The architecture is there further giving life to the city as a whole.

The game world doesn't feel alive.  Some characters in the game are good and the atmosphere is nice too. I like thee lvl system and the way the game looks. These things hints at what the game could have been.

Самые известные фильмы «Бегущий по лезвию». Предком компьютерной игры послужила настольная игры Cyberpunk2020, в которой описывалось немного другое развитие человечества. Cyberpunk – антиутопичное видение будущего, в котором огромные корпорацииCyberpunk2077 стала абсолютно новой страницей в истории компании CD Project Red. Футуристический жанр научной фантастики возник в 80-ых годах. Самые известные фильмы «Бегущий по лезвию». Предком компьютерной игры послужила настольная игры Cyberpunk2020, в которой описывалось немного другое развитие человечества. Cyberpunk – антиутопичное видение будущего, в котором огромные корпорации правят миром, трансплантация аугментаций в человеческое тело является нормой дня, а разрыв между бедными и богатыми приобрел огромные размеры. В этом жестоком и бездушном мире вы становитесь Ви, обычным наемником, который(ая) пытается сделать себе имя в огромном городе, имя которому Найт-Сити. Какой будет Ви – решает игрок. Во время создания персонажа вам предложат три пути вступления в жизнь наёмника. Они определят предысторию персонажа и особенности поведения. Пролог занимает лишь 30 минут игрового времени, но затем он отражается на протяжении всей игры. О главных героях.Все же решение разработчика вести повествование от первого лица поддается логике. История Cyberpunk2077 личная. Все вращается вокруг Ви, и его(её) роли в жестоком мире Найт-Сити. Если вы относитесь к тому типу игроков, которые ассоциируют себя с игровыми персонажами до мельчайших деталей, перспектива производит поразительный эффект. Чем ближе мы знакомимся с историей Ви, тем прочнее связь, о которой мы узнаем только в финале игры. Вторым главным «героем» становится Джонни Сильверхенд, котрого играет Киану Ривз. Те, кто знаком с историей мира Cyberpunk2020, знают, что рокер из группы Samurai и по совместительству террорист умер за много десятилетий до событий Cyberpunk2077, но из-за обстоятельств, которые будут рассказаны в самой игре, цифровая копия разума Джонни оказывается в голове Ви, конечно у Ви есть свои планы и мысли, но Джонни пытается манипулировать сознанием Ви, воздействовать на него. В воспоминаниях мы узнаем детали из жизни рокера и его мотивации. С другой стороны, у Ви есть безоговорочная воля к выживанию. От пролога и до самого финала, история во многом основывается на том факте, что вы никогда не сможете быть уверены в том, кому можно доверять. Игра и ее повествование поднимают философские вопросы, которые заставляют задуматься над «Что такое быть Я?», «Что значит быть человеком?», «Каковы пределы вашего собственного разума?». Но не смотря на мрачную картину будущего, депрессивное настроение в повествовании, мир без надежд на будущее, Cyberpunk2077 открывает пространство для эмоциональных и тонких моментов.… Expand "

The NPC is still so unintelligent, the NPC in the Witcher 3 was infinitely better, when bumping into  pedestrians you phase through them and when you look back at them they don't seem to care as if nothing ever happened like you were some kind of ghost; When you are in a mission and reload to the last checkpoint when you flatline there are plenty of times where you reset literally more than a minute away from where you died ,so if you die a lot of times in certain missions you waste a lot of time. Melee combat  looks too goofy for a game trying to be immersive, the developers loaded in two punching animations for the game, no kicks, no uppercuts, no variations everything you can see V do in first person feels so robotic. Didn't even buy this game till patch 1.5 i still have a lot to get off issues with the game. I stopped playing the game when my save file for 5 hours got lost,  i don't know whether it was CDPR or epic games that had an issue it doesn't matter because i don't want to play the game anymore, unless of course some massive update miraculously fixes things and saves the game probably in five years.... even then the best i would ever give this game is a 5 rating.

As for last-gen consoles owners (PS4, Xbox) just don't buy it, it's unplayable. you'll get crashes, graphics that looks like a PS2 game, and dips to 10 FPS making it more like a slideshow.  CD Projekt Red lied to you, console owners.  Maybe on PS5 or Xbox series next, after CD Projekt Red has released multiple updates and patches for those platforms, it might be playable on consoles.  No wonder they didn't allow reviewers to use their own screenshots/videos in their PC reviews, and certainly no wonder they didn't send out console versions to reviewers so the obvious problems with those versions couldn't be published beforehand.  The current version, even with the day 0/1 patch, is a beta, and the consumers are the play-testers. it seems obvious that CD Projekt Red had to release this before the holiday season, no matter what, even if it means giving themselves a bad name forever.  Well done CD, you just utterly ruined your reputation being one of the ""good guys"" in gaming industry, please take your seat next to EA and Ubisoft at the table of shame. I suggest you give all that money you tricked people out of back to them, and dissolve the company. but not before you put out enough patches to make this game remotely playable.

In 2022 you can expect a flawless playing experience with almost no bugs, with improved content and tweaks. If you buy the game now you can be sure that you’ll have no issues. Now the question is, is the game good?  In my opinion Cyberpunk is the most immersive RPG ever created rivaling games like Red Dead Redemption 2 in detail and immersion and I’ll explain why. Consider the conversation system.  Most dialogue follows the traditional system we are used to where you are siting down or fixed in place while the conversation is on going. But its not always like that. There are many situations where both you and other characters can often move around while dialogue is ongoing. The game has interactions planned for most situation you can think of.  Unlike most RPGs characters move and express their emotions in every single conversation. Animations don’t seem to repeat. They pickup a cigar, eat foot, move around and drink dynamically while the conversation is going in a very believable immersive way. If you take a lot of time to continue a conversation they’ll react asking you for input. In some cases if you don’t respond quickly they’ll act with or without your response. It’s hard to explain and you need to experience it to understand it. But it’s a clear evolution of past dialogue systems. Considering the thousands of dialogue options and possible interactions this is clearly ahead most if not all RPGs created so far.  Regarding quests.  We all know about branching paths in quests and so on. But Cyberpunk takes it up a notch.  I’m not going to give spoilers but to sum up one quest can have branches with branches and more branches of options basically covering every possible scenario the player can think of with drastically different encounters and places you explore depending on your decisions. Additionally, how you approach any encounter is up to you. Sure there is the typical stealth or gun blazing gameplay but with far far more options. For instance, you can use any kind of weapon you can think of. From guns of course to exotic weapons like swords or just your fists. Or perhaps no combat at all. Missions or quests are extremely well done with many options, many ways of completing them. I often find my self repeating a quest just to see the different outcomes. To aid in your playstyle you have thousands of perks and different skill trees of skill trees of skill trees to unlock your character abilities. You have some really well put up mini games that are far better put than the old “follow the trail” mini games. For instance situations where you need to investigate a crime scene for instance with a clever mini game that has several layers to it. I won’t spoil it but it’s fun.   And there are many other mini games that reward patience over just rushing it. In the streets of Night City things happen all around you and you can chose to participate or not. Be it one guy on the streets rambling about his religion or some gangs fighting over territory and many other dynamic events. You can gain street cred in the process. These really impacts gameplay over time. There are thousands of items littering around that you can grab and check. There are stores where you can buy food, weapons and clothes. There are bars and all sorts of places you can explore with dynamic events filling them up so exploration is never boring. There are fight clubs and all that type of content you already expect in most games like this. There are hundreds of radio stations, TV shows and  news shows covering game events. Also  places that have no purpose to the player but are there just to set the mood of the city. You can hear thousands of conversations going around in the city and they don’t repeat. They exist just to further immerse you in the world and further give you context to what is going on. The world changes as you progress in the game. Night City is truly a busy city with day night cycles that completely change the tone and even the content available to you. Everything is remarkably detailed with no loss of quality be it in exterior or interior environments. Not like other open world games where exteriors looked good but interiors lacked detail often looking like empty rooms. This is the complete opposite. Everything looks as it should in a real life apartment, hotel room,  store or whatever. And the main story. You can expect a great story, with interesting characters, motivations and a high budget presentation to keep you entertained. Without giving away spoilers it’s one hell of a ride. The game has a bit of everything for everyone. And even if you don’t enjoy some aspects of it, there is no way you won’t appreciate the amount of work and detail put into this game. If the game was released as it is now it would have been an instant classic. It’s a shame it didn’t. But one thing is sure. It’s one of the best RPG games ever and for sure the best Cyberpunk style RPG.… Expand "

The shooting, weapons and loot are of the highest quality but there seems to be an endless supply of content. The combat AI is actually pretty good, and makes for engaging fights, and higher difficulty settings make you engage in more of the weapons, mods, and engagement options.  The story, voice acting and directing, and the dialogue are top notch. This goes through all the main quest and the side quests.  The density of content is the highest that has ever been seen in an open world this large. Everything is hand crafted, no procedural generation, giving a feeling of quality and importance to every square inch of the game. The insides of the buildings are packed with content and lovingly crafted.  Despite all of the bugs, the game has a very high quality to it. There is very little clipping and a very high level of detail in making all the animations look realistic down to the smallest details. All of the mechanics, systems and menus are very intuitive and easy to engage with, making it so there is no reason not to use every last feature.

I understand the controversies behind this game, but I can't deny the love, passion, and long hours of work that went into this game by the developers.

Some gameplay aspects are very poor in particular, such as driving and combat feeling awkward, as well as most side quests found in the city being very dull, mostly consisting of ‘go to a place and kill a guy or go to a place and kill 10 guys’.I should also mention that this game is absolutely not an RPG, as lots of people expected it to be. You will be playing as the character ‘V’ for the entire game, not your own character, in a linear story where your dialogue and character’s abilities / skills will do virtually nothing to sway the story. It somewhat feels like CDPR made a Ubisoft sandbox in all this time, to make a comparison.

It is an open world rpg so don't expect anything else. The driving didn't bother me personally I think it takes a little getting use to but after a while I really didn't have any trouble at all.My biggest issue with the game is the way all the side missions just constantly flood in you will be getting phone calls consistently for like a good 15 or 20 mins after the intro play randomly as you play the game. I feel like there is a better way to filter them in. There is still a ton for me to explore in this game and I can't wait. I'm 11 hours in so far and I can't wait to get back to playing it.

Pedestrians just walk in a straight line and disappear as soon as you aren't looking. If you shoot at people, police will start spawning right next to you, and if you get in a car and drive one block away they despawn and the world goes back to its default state as if nothing happened.  Too bad then that shooting people is the only way to even interact with the world. The streets are littered with food stalls and the like, but no NPC ever uses them, and if you go up to them and press the talk button they will just tell you to go away. The few shops that actually exist are all copy pastes of each other. They all sell the same stuff and they're all willing to buy your junk at the same price too. 99% of the doors in the city are unopenable, and any big buildings that you might think are explorable have arbitrary locked gates to keep you inside a very small area, leaving the rest only to be looked at.

You may hear that people's experience in Cyberpunk 2077 has been hindered by the implications of its buggy release even with over eight-years in development, but completing it after 40+ hours doing side missions and whatnot for the first time, I was blown away. Through my years of playing story-driven video games, I have never cried to a finale until now.  In fact, when I first opened Cyberpunk 2077, doubts were circling in my mind about the bugs and optimisation issues, however, on Medium settings, it is somewhat playable on an RTX 2060 Super and the bugs were infrequent. Driving through Night City, or looking at it from a distance is a sight to see. Everything from the world-building to its highly developed characters/story was breathtaking (you totally didn't see that reference coming!)  Not to mention, I think it was breath of fresh air to play an RPG that was relatively short, as it allows for greater replayability in my opinion, and that stands true because I am onto my third character. Additionally, the messaging system is a cool side feature that forms a connection between the player and character more. The voice acting was phenomenal, and they definitely helped bring the characters to life. The romance side of things is... acceptable, to say the least. I was a little disappointed at the lack of screen time between V and the partner of your choice with only one intimate mission.  The combat is the most fun I have had in an RPG before. Augmentations were cool to experiment with and the first-person animations feel satisfying (that Malorian Arms 3516 animation, though). Stealth, along with hacking security, felt entirely optional but definitely an interesting way to play through the missions. Although Cyberpunk 2077 isn't labelled as an RPG title, it still plays like one, however, not the most advanced I have seen; where are the choices that actually have consequences!  Cars handle well and are realistically heavier than some other notable games like Grand Theft Auto V. Admittedly, they are buggy, and bikes have questionable physics that don't work very well. Cyberpunk 2077 also has other neat minor features like Photo Mode that allows you to pause the game and interact with the environment or adding post-processing effects/filters to take the perfect screenshot outside the perspective of V, something I would like to see in more games.  I have been spending a lot of time praising this game, except understand there are many downsides as well. Some I felt during the gameplay was how useless crafting felt since I never really had to do it that much. For quality-of-life features, too much, unfortunately. No way to change the appearance of your physical attributes and clothing, really CDPR? Some of these were actually in their previous popular title, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so I don't understand? From a technical standpoint, you can tell the game was made at the last minute, like how it crashes upon minimising, FPS drops, poorly coded AI and duplication or disappearance of items during cutscenes. Also, side missions ceasing to continue? Come on, you're better than that.  Lastly, the score is incredible; one of the best I have ever heard. Whether you dislike Cyberpunk 2077 or not, it is difficult to say otherwise.  Edit: After months of contemplating, my view of the game has negatively changed, therefore the score of this review will drop from an eight to a seven. Learning about the false promises that CD Projekt Red said they would deliver has certainly made me upset with their decisions. The 2018 gameplay trailer showed a completely different game and although they labelled it as ""Work In Progress"", it is blatant the trailer was produced in such a sleazy way that made the company hope they could be redeemed from the bad press. What a shame it didn't work. Ultimately, it was a method of deception to make us believe the gameplay shown could be improved. Instead, what we actually got was a watered-down version.  Cyberpunk 2077 is, by all means, a good game if you overlook the nasty marketing and fundamental problems/bugs. However, I will not accept the dirty corporate implementations in advertising a game that we thought was in good hands. Apparently, no AAA gaming company can deliver the product we paid for, huh?

That isn't to say that there aren't some issues on pc which I'll touch on later.  Let's start with the pros. The world design is intriguing and grand. I could spend hours just driving around the city or observing details in the buildings, signs, npcs, etc. Furthermore, many of the quests and characters are interesting and fleshed out. That said, this game isn't the holy grail of combat games. Specifically, the gun controls (kickback and aim) feel a little wonky to me, however, with enough tweaking can be much improved and is quite enjoyable nonetheless. The combat is passable.  My main concern with this game is what seems to me to be a few missing shoo-in features. Why are you not able to customize your character after the prologue? Why can you not take the metro? There's only a couple romance options? Probably cut due to rushing for release date and covid. Just unfortunate scenario and could see this stuff being added back in.  And lastly, is the issue with bugs and performance. For me, these actually haven't been much of an issue only dipping below 60 occasionally in dense scenes and bugs being minor. Occasionally a dead chars body will act strangely, char will disappear briefly, or I'll need to fiddle with objectives to get my quest objective to reappear. Ultimately though, they've been been infrequent (only a few times in 15hrs of play) and haven't really taken away from my experience. I mention it because, while minor in my experience with the game, is not something that would be in a game I rate 10/10.  All in all a very ambitious game that suffered in some areas as a result of that ambition but still delivered in many others. Mentioned flaws above hold it back from anything better than 8 imo but could easily be improved with some patches.… Expand "

CD Projekt Red promised so many things, to the point where everyone praised them and had high hopes.  Unfortunately, Cyberpunk 2077 didn't deliver, so many broken promises, poor performance, lies and the game just isn't this holy grail that everyone expected, is it good? Yeah, of course, some things about it are absolutely amazing, but the amount of issues is quite staggering, issues that go beyond just the poor performance.  The story is surprisingly solid, it touches some interesting topics and has depth, great set-pieces, a lot of action and some pretty emotional scenes. The characters are likeable and the pacing is very consistent even though the last few hours felt a little bit rushed.  The gunplay feels satisfying, every weapon has a different feeling to it, and there are some special guns with unique power-ups. There is a decent amount of weapons to get, upgrades and skills to unlock, nothing extraordinary but pretty nice.  The world looks gorgeous, Night City is one of the best looking cities in a videogame and it's filled with content, the side quests are phenomenal, and I enjoyed exploring.  Where the game disappointed me the most is the AI, it's very outdated, the world feels lifeless and you can't interact with the people or the city. The RPG mechanics are the biggest offender, the game barely feels like an RPG, the dialogue options are almost absent and choices barely matter.  Lastly, I did encounter some visual glitches, texture pop-ins, frame drops and even crashes, but I still enjoyed the game, granted I am not justifying the fact that CD Projekt Red lied to the customers.  Ultimately this game is a weak RPG but still a great game in many ways, and as much as I enjoyed it, I can definitely say that its flawed to its core. Despite the technical issues the game suffers from, this is some of CD Projekt Red's best work so far, it definitely could've been a masterpiece, but the foundation is broken, what a shame.

I am still playing through many of the great side quests, finished the main story line and got one of the endings but sitting at around 35 hours or so. I have loved it and the game looks amazing, managed to run the game on high/ultra settings with Ray Tracing and get 60fps on average unless i'm speeding through the city or enter a crowded market its just a shame despite so many NPCs walking the streets the game feels pretty baren.  I had one crash and it was during my first few minutes when i was changing graphics settings over and over to find the best setting for my rig. The bugs i encountered were that of T poses here and there as well as once or twice my car or bike falling through the ground, lastly was a bug where the scanner function would get stuck and i had to reload my save to fix it. In the grand scheme of things none of these bugs made me mad or anything but I was just lucky.  Unfortunately, CDPR over sold the capabilities of this game, there's no hairdressers, ripper docs don't have further unlockable cosmetic cyberware for V to equip, I see so many characters with different cyberware and even some characters with chrome arms or bodies, V can't get anything like that, the bigest changes for V you can make are the Arms, like Mantis blades and Gorilla Arms but its honestly pretty minimal. There's no car customisation, not even being able to change the colour some them. Took ages to grind for the cash to buy many of them. The Quadra from the trailer, that nice black one with the spoiler and such, the one i bought in game is a bright ass aqua colour or something.

Es gelingt nicht. Zu viele Schwächen. Die Grafik ist zu bunt, zu plastisch, zu weich. Statt anfangs die Stadt selbst zu entdecken, wird dies übersprungen und nur als Zwischensequenz dargestellt. Auch andere Szenen werden per Blackscreen gekürzt (erstes Konzert v. Silverhand oder Flucht vom Anschlagsplatz). Ich kann das Spiel nicht selbst entdecken, die Scripts nehmen alles weg. Andererseits vermisse ich Sequenzen, die die Augmentierung bzw. Bauteilreparatur beim Ripperdoc etc. detailliert und schön animiert zeigen, fehlende Immersion. Unpräzises Waffenhandling, kein gutes Hit-Feedback im Kampf, rote Schrift auf rot/grauem Hintergrund ist schäuslich anstrengend zu lesen, keine Farbänderungs-Option. Charactere und Sprüche wirken zu künstlich, zu übertrieben cool. Sich bekreuzigende Typen und diese ganze lächerliche Esoterik im Spiel gehen mir brachial auf den Nerv, der assoziierte SciFi Style von CP leidet unter dieser religiösen/pseudowissenschaftlichen Darstellung. Diese spanischen Wörter von Jackie (Chica, Ese, Carajo...) finde ich seltsam und verstörend, ebenso die Krypto-Animation der Untertitel bei Übersetzungen. Im Screenshot-Mode werden Elemente ausgeblendet, Blickwinkel beschränkt und Menüs verkompliziert. Warum gibt es keinen Free Flight Mode? Von Polizei-Spawn Bugs, Glitch-Autos und Progress-Problemen, Hard Crashes usw. rede ich erst garnicht. Ich kann mit der Story nichts anfangen, das meiste ist belangloses BlaBla von intellektuell minderbemittelten aber dafür extracoolen 0815-Leuten. Der Mord am arasaka-Boss wird als große Nummer dargestellt, während tausende andere Morde normal sind und in der Reizüberflutung der Stadt untergehen. Völlig unverhältnismäßig. Einerseits ist alles Korrupt und degeneriert, aber viele Storydialoge versuchen, eine gewisse Integrität darzustellen, was für mich deplatziert ist. Kein Third-Person, unübersichtliche Mapfarbe, die mich wahnsinnig macht. Das Hacking-Minigame wird schnell eintönig. Auf leichter Difficulty ist alles viel zu leicht, auf Normal bereits zu unangenehm. Da fehlt mir eine Zwischenstufe. Der entdeckt-Signalton nervt abartig und die Logik, warum man teils trotz Deckung gesichtet wird und ein anderes mal nicht, obwohl man exponiert ist, leuchtet mir nicht ein. CP2077 hätte noch 1,5 Jahre Entwicklungszeit gebraucht. Im Vergleich zum Hexer saumäßig schwach. Auch vom angedachten Multiplayer sind wir Lichtjahre entfernt. Fazit: Das herausragende Vertrauen in CDPR aus den Witcherjahren wurde hart verspielt, CP2077 ist nur ein fahler Schatten dessen, was es hätte werden können.

CDPR offered in their last games good narrative and character development and mediocre mechanics and systems and Cyberpunk isn't an exception, but this time the game has much worse, inconsistent, shallow world design with not much to explore out the narrative rails or far less secondary content than The Withcer 3. Additionally this time there are some specific contexts in which the quality is way below average, bad, not simply mediocre: Enemy and npc AI, driving, combat, the superficiality of lifepaths, the low interactivity and reactivity of the world, etc.  I want to add something that personally bothers me and I have not seen it enough criticized: It's design is not Cyberpunk. Its concept, world, art and ""level"" design are too colourful, brigth, sunny, clean, ordinary, mild, superficial and presentist. Billie Eilish with bionic parts isn't Cyberpunk. The cars look too regular with only frivolous ""cool-looking stuff"" additions, the ncps are mumble rappers with implants, those implants are way too extended, the social differences aren't enough marked, the corporations are way less oppressive than they should be, there is not a clear vision of the final triumph of savage dystopian corporate capitalism, the generic post-apocalyptic gangs don't fit the role of annoying little microbes that they are in classic cyberpunk compared with the megacorps, there is more of bad boy/girl superficial and edgy teenager pose in dialogs and stories than a true nihilist tone.  The game narrative in the cinematographic/literarian sense is good, but videogames are not simply classic narrative. Without enough and good interactivity, linking systems and mechanics with any supposed story, characters or dialogue, a title with good narrative can be still a medriocre-bad videogame.

And no, it would seem that choices do not matter in this game half as much as we wanted them to, not even as much as they did in The Witcher 3.  So why have I rated this game 10 out of 10?  Because regardless of the negativity surrounding the launch (bugs included), this is the best damn RPG ever made! The graphics (at least on PC) are jaw-dropping. The gameplay is second to none; you want a sneaky stealth-a-like, this is it... Blows the likes of Deus Ex out of the water, and the hacking mini-game actually makes you think (... a little bit). You want a gung-ho run n' gun, you can't go wrong here. And the number of weapons, customizations, and crafting options will keep you coming back for more.  As if that's not enough the stories, writing, voice acting, character development, etc. are all in a league of their own (OK so we expect at least this from CDPR, but you can't knock them down when they've only themselves to beat).  There is so much to do in Night City, I played this game for 7 days straight, about 14 hours a day (Stuck in lock-down there's not a lot of time for anything but gaming, right?) before I decided I needed a break from it. And I still haven't seen everything the game has to offer.  I completely understand the negative reviews for this game but, put the hype and disappointment to one side and look at it objectively... There isn't anything else in the world right now that is anywhere near as good as this and there probably won't be for the foreseeable future.… Expand "

I'm 12 hours in, scratching the surface. The world is amazing, the amount work that was put to create this Cyberpunk vibe, this multilayered city.  Small details all over you, every alley, corner, roof. Based on what I experienced - quest are multilayered and can play to different outcomes based on decisions, background and skills. Great stuff that some stats can unlock additional dialogue features, like in F2. Can't say a lot about character development, but it looks like multiple builds and playthroughs should be a thing. Specialisation is a must have. Weapon customisation, character customisation, factions, standings, cyber enhancements. All is there. 9 is because the initial glitches, which are really sporadic in the 1.3 version I started to play, and not game breaking. Havent had a single crash or being forced to reload. When they polish that to standard of W3 it will be a great game.  Sadly, this is next-gen - PS4/Xbox versions are just a money grab. If you a console player, wait for SeriesX/PS5 version release.

Wow what can I say....I'm disappointed in CDPR for blantly lying to their customers first of all. It really saddens me to give it a 1/10 because literally its unplayable even with a RTX 3080. The game is not finished. And we are beta testers trying to report bugs to the developers who clearly didn't play their own game.The choices really don't matter in the game. You get always the same outcome after dialogues. Ending is only affected by one choice in act 3.Romance always end the same way. And its either a yes or no in the end. No build up relationship needed.The Mantis blades wall hanging technique from the trailer has been removed for no reason.Some parts of the map are not completed yet.Their is no bribery and corrupted cops as CDPR claimed.Cops spawn instantly behind you.Car handling is so bad and it looks very floaty.Buggy as hell. I've died numerous times from just walking.Game crashes frequently even with updated drivers and latest RTX 3080.The performance is garbage. I barely get 60 fps and it drops down to 50 fps in crowded places.Player shadows is a joke.The worst is the no progress bug that won't let you progress unless you back track a couple of hours in hope you don't get it again.I keep getting white flashes that flicker in the screen from time to time and causes me headaches if repeated a couple of times.Weapons RNG loot system is disgusting. You can pick up a gun and get +10 damage, and then load the save and get it at +80 damage. Legendary weapons slots spawn 1-4 slots for mods completely RNG based.Male V voice sounded so bad, bored, and unentertaining. Female V was very good though.Side quests are too repetitive unlike the Witcher 3 which had one of the best side quests I've seen.Main story line is short and while written well was still plagued by bugs and glitches.Final boss just glitched and didn't move at all.

Открытый мир наоборот очень классный, меня прям тянет исследовать его, зачищать лагери бандитов, убивать преступников и получать деньги, ведь везде локации разные, где-то лучше будет потйи на пролом с мечом, где-то нужно быть аккуратнее и расстреливать из укрытия, где-то можно стать коысой и отвлекая врагов убивать их по одиночке. К каким-то локация вход о крыт, а что бы попасть в другой лагерь нужнл например немного попаркурить и это очень круто. Так же иногда можнл встретить знаки вопроса клторый могут вылится как в интересное приключение, так и в обычный квест по-типу убей того, отвезу туда и т.д. Так же мне очень понравились заказы и сайл-квесты, они очень интересные. Например в одном из заказов нужно не просто убить кибер-психа, а захватить склад компании по доставки, войти в систему для чего трубуется 7 уровень интелекто и только потом украсть грузовик с грузом.Не понравилась мне физика езды на машине/мотоцыкле. Допустим ты очень высокой скоротсти влетел в другую машину или в забор, и максимум что произойдет, это просто получишь вмятину и оставишь следы на заборе, ты не вылетмшь, не получишь урона, ты просто сможешь спойкойно поезать дальше. Так же меня немного напрягает полу-пофигистическое поведение мирных нпс.например на улице если я кого-то убью то все разбегутся, это вроде нормально, но если я начну убивать людей в машинах, то другим людям в транспорте будет пофиг, они будут сидеть и ждать своей участи.В целом геймплениые минусы закончились, остались только баги, но они не критичны.

Warning: This is early access! If they dropped this game without notice and charged 30 bucks for beta I would say its a seven outta ten. With all the hype and 8 years in development... this is trash.  Gameplay: The best part of this RPG game is the gun play which is good but has some serious balance issues. No one wants to play a smart weapon after a few encounters when the sniper and crit pistols can kill on a headshot. There isn't several playstyles like CDPR claimed. There is only guns blazing. The only incentive for anyone to go stealth is so you can save the game at important parts of the map which you can't do if you're in combat and you are in combat the whole map if you even shoot one person. So if you go in blasting and you die at the last enemy.. you start over. That's not even a problem though cuz the AI is dumb AF. Hard mode was a walk in the park with the AI either standing still, shooting at walls, or glitching in boxes.  Visuals: I'm on a 2070 super. Forget ray tracing without DLSS and forget 60 plus frames with anything less than an RTX '70 or '80 card. In fact, forget this game if you aren't on a PC with one. If you are on console, play easy mode or normal because no way you gonna out maneuver AIs, dumb as they are, with 20 fps. That being said, the city is beautiful at times. The lights are gorgeous in dark areas and blinding at others.  Story: Unimportant really. Dialogue and life path don't affect the game at all. Make no mistake; THIS IS A LINEAR RPG! There really isn't much to do except some good side missions and some basic campaign. You can't play the pachinkos(casinos), you dont run into random events, there are no mini games that you can interact with. The NPCs are linear and procedural with no purpose. RDR2 and GTA did it a million times better. Exploring night city is a novelty that quickly wears off. Beneath the aesthetics there isn't much.

It all depends on the context. My experiences as an experienced gamer will be totally different than the experiences of a new lad who hasn't seen many big titles. The new lad will not compare. Imagine that you start playing the game without any expectations or watching the marketing stuff... your perception would be totally different. I believe that trailers or opinions of others before you taste something will ruin your very own experience. However, the gaming industry just like the movie industry needs marketing to sell the product and make money.  Think of a guy, a GTA fan, who was waiting for CP2077 long and was living the hype. His rig is from a low/medium range. Then he buys the game on a day one and BANG! 20/30 FPS and you can't shoot people from the window while driving. Moreover, the badges are not spawning as nice as in GTA. What a disaster!  So what do I think about the game? Let me compare, lol;-) I am recently playing RDR2. No bugs, or graphical artefacts, outstanding graphics, nice NPC AI, flowless gaming. I love that game. Yet, on a Friday night after 3 beers, I will switch it to Quake Champions or start watching YouTube because it becomes boring after a while. How does my Friday night look with CP2077? Last Friday I emptied all my cans and was still playing the game till 4.00 am. My Saturday and Sunday looked the same (except the drinking). I literally couldn't stop playing... it is so addictive. When you drive a car and listen to a metal radio station you can feel a bit like in the GTA but when you are on foot in a shooting... well that's exciting. The colours and horizontal/vertical complexity of the city made my eye explode. I could not go from one point to another without watching everything.  The game reminds me of a GTA/Skyrim hybrid. The FPP while on the street and in buildings was a very good choice because you can feel like more in the game, more real. You enjoy and appreciate the world and the NPCs outfits.  Is the CP2077 engine flowless? No, it's not. Did I have to tweak my rig to get a few more FPS? Yes, I had (poor console fellas). There are some bugs. Some things could be improved or changed. The NPCs AI is not great and I can't kill people with two-punches, and the police suck. However, those issues could not spoil my fun or change my opinion of the game. Right now, I would love to leave everything and start playing. Did I have this with RDR2, GTAV, Skyrim (sorry my old friend, I was getting bored in the dungeons) and any other gib games? No, with only one exception. The Witcher 3.  We are coming to a conclusion. It's all about an interesting story and ""adult/mature"" feeling of the game. That's why I rate CP2077 10/10. Imagine Ridley Scott making the ""Alien"" and reducing the age to 14+ to sell more tickets in theatres. What kind of Alien would we got ;-) All the crew would be in their 20s showing their brilliant-white teeth :-D Nevertheless, I hope they fix the issues and let the other to have a great first-time experience in the nearest future.  Game creators had a vision when they were making that game. I can feel it. Have they delivered? I will leave the judgement to you.… Expand "

Bugs, well, some gentlemen exaggerate quite a lot, I passed the first half of the game by 1.3 and after a pause of quite a long time I finished the game by 1.5. I have never had such a bug that would prevent me from playing, there were not enough rare car textures that were not loaded, they were fixed on 1.5, there were bugs with objects hanging in the air, or after a reboot, the driver moved from the passenger seat to the driver's seat on top of another character. And that's all, I can't remember any more of them. Gameplay. How to put it here on the beam, borderlands, Skyrim, the Witcher. About Borderlands Guns with numbers, one does not like it, but I like the fact that I did not go through the whole game with one gun, but there was a constant turnover of them, and I managed to try a lot. Skyrim. No, well, have you tried to fight with cold weapons? It feels like a Skyrim skeleton. Witcher, specifically in what, I can not say, you are attached to the characters in the same way, the logic of quests is the same, and in General you feel a familiar handwriting. But in terms of gameplay, stealth normal, shooting, well, meh, you can not say that it is at least something impressive, absolutely. transport. I rode the whole game on arch Jackie, and after passing I bought myself an outlaw gts, a motorcycle. almost always was, I want to turn around, pull the handbrake, it is drift, and gets back up, why, and most importantly, WHY? cars do not have such a problem, the handbrake pulled-turned around. open world, beautiful, that's all. you can not say that super-duper-perduper but I am OK, but there is no desire to go and look for graffiti, it does not draw in itself, because of this, I was 100 percent immersed in the plot. Plot. No spoilers. originally, this is far from a typical story of revenge, or the restoration of world justice, it's a high-quality damn story that immerses you more than completely, you are imbued with sympathy for the characters, Panam, Judy, Sol, river, Beast, Misty, Jackie, and damn even the Perales family, with a couple of quests, and then attract me. And the song from the credits? I listen to it on repeat, despite the fact that my main genre is like metal, I usually don't listen to such pop music, but this song relaxes right wildly. In General, I did not expect this game in all seriousness, I did not watch trailers, I did not have any expectations, absolutely, I installed it for fun, maybe, as my system will run it, I had to buy it, because it ran well. And you know what, dudes and dudes-girls, this game is just great, bold, really bold, where else in the game will you meet a penis? the only game I can remember is the second Hitman, at the beginning of the first mission you can look through binoculars at the pissing guard and see his lowpoly pp. it is well, as much as possible without censorship, that's what you need in the age of toothless almost family friendly games, with what, this is not an impudent shoving of penises and dirty words as if this is a porn game of some kind, not everything is harmonious here. For this and a 10/10 in General, there would not be this fresh breath of air in the censored modern game development, I would give a maximum of seven points. and those who play zeros babble, well, it's funny, guys, they screwed themselves, created their own imaginary world, and are angry, just like it was when the third whitcher came out, now, you can't meet a single person who spoke very badly about this game, you are either indifferent to it, or you love it, and I'm sure in a year the second, with this game will be the same, because the game is really cool.

The game still a lot of love from CDPR to became what was intended to be, but if your plan is to do the main story and the side quests, the game is fine at is, keeping in mind that you need a decent PC to run it.  The level of detail, the art, the voice actors, the story, the choices, are just incredible.

For CDPR to go from witcher 3 to this is a massive fall, however its the lying and the false advertising that has made me lose all respect for them. Personally I think they should even be offering refunds to those on PC who pre ordered or bought on launch day, and who have played over 2 hours. Seeing as its a hollow shell of the game promised to us by a developer we had trust in.Like I said its a somewhat good game, and I would purchase on a sale in a years time once perhaps its more polished and has more features, though I think its unlikely for them to overhaul the horrible AI and physics, and add in the majority of the cut content, so I doubt it will ever be the game we were so sold on.… Expand "

I've played other amazing games, and I hope to continue to play amazing games, but this game will always stand out to me as one of the best. I think people's problem with this game is that they are comparing it to GTA. This is completely different from GTA in almost every way. Cyberpunk is an RPG at its core, not an open world. Yes, there are open-world aspects to the game, but they are not the primary focus of the game. That honor goes to the story. The story is truly phenomenal and I enjoyed every minute of it. If you're a science fiction fan, go buy this game right now and stop reading my review. For anyone else, if you enjoy a good, interesting story and have the money, buy the game. You will enjoy it as well.  The story is what makes this game amazing. This being said, the game is definitely made for fans of science fiction like myself. While one could definitely get enjoyment from the game without being a fan of science fiction, true science fiction fans will love it. Yes, it may not be the most action-packed at times, but that's completely fine by me. The story is so good that I enjoyed the dialogue-heavy missions equally as much if not more than the combat-heavy ones. I was thinking about this game long after I stopped playing and stayed up late many nights just to continue on with the story. The characters are all realistic and have depth. It's amazing to see the evolution of many of the characters that you've grown to love since the beginning of the game. The side missions also add a lot to the story. For many of the side missions, I would go so far as to say that they are essential to the main story. They really help you get to know the characters better and open up many more opportunities in the game. The story in this game is truly a masterpiece and I can't wait to play through it again. I also cannot wait for the DLC. This is not a perfect game. Why then am I giving it a 10/10 if it's not perfect? The story in the game is simply so amazing that I am willing to look past the bugs and unfinished parts of the game.  While it could be improved in some areas, specifically the AI, the gameplay is overall extremely good and I genuinely enjoyed most of the missions. Combat is fun and there are a large variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from. For my playthrough, I went with a balanced character who was decent at everything. The main story is probably around 20-25 hours, which may seem short, but if you actually take your time and enjoy the game you will be able to get lots of hours of enjoyment from it. It took me 56 hours for my first playthrough. I took my sweet time enjoying all of the amazing side missions and taking in all Night City had to offer.  Now the not so good. Yes, there are bugs, but they are all fixable. On PC, the bugs are nowhere near as bad as people are making them out to be. This is not ""Cyberbug 2077."" If you're overly concerned about bugs, just wait a few months. The game is extremely demanding. And yes, CDPR did lie about the system requirements. I have an RTX 3090, the most powerful graphics card available in 2020. I am running the game at 4k high settings with ray tracing set to ultra. I have DLSS set to balanced. I managed to get 45 FPS in the city and up to 60 FPS in less demanding areas. This is with an RTX 3090. Yes, a $1500 GPU, and I still can't get a constant 60 FPS. While the game will run at lower settings and resolutions on a lower-end card, you definitely need an extremely powerful PC for the game to truly shine.  I know this was a long review, but I truly cannot recommend this game enough. It is a true masterpiece of a game and I cannot wait to continue playing as the game gets more updates and content and to continue exploring everything this game has to offer.… Expand "

Проработано Всё звучание игры - от фоновой музыки до шума города. Диалоги жителей в городе идут на разных языках в зависимости от района. По радио часто слышишь последние новости. Машины звучат по-разному. Озвучка персонажей на русском языке очень хороша, никаких претензий нет. Погружение максимальное.  -Оптимизация! Тут есть оптимизация на ПК. У меня GTX 980, видеокарта 5-летний давности и я проходил на средних настройках графики в разрешении 2560 х 1080.

Недостатки  - ИИ Недостатки игры в следующем - ИИ действительно просто тупой, его нужно полностью переделывать. Это касается и противников и обычных жителей города, и поведений машин в игре. В этом смысле игре нужны обновления в стиле No Mans Sky.  - Нет интерактивных действий Недостаточно свободных интерактивных действий в игре. Например нет возможности просто сесть где-то на лавочку в парке или в любом другом месте. В барах и ресторанах это чувствуется особенно сильно, так как дизайн локаций просто потрясающе детализирован, но нет возможности в него погрузиться, например просто сесть за барную стойку и выпить напиток, который ты заказал (это можно только в рамках сюжета). Должны быть прописанные диалоги с местными жителями районов, хотя бы немного раскрывающие историю локаций, как в играх Bethesda. Сейчас местные жители просто болванчики, выдающие по одной фразе, что снижает погружение в игру.  Надеюсь разработчики будут поддерживать игру, исправят технические недоделки, но больше всего я жду больших дополнений к сюжету. Сейчас финал ""открытый"", и я считаю, что должно быть дополнение в стиле ""кровь и вино"" для 3 Ведьмака, где будут подведены все итоги.… Expand "

I don't believe people that are saying that this game is fun in its current state, I guess they are suffering from Stockholm syndrome or something. As it looks now the game will maybe be playable in september. By ""playable"" I mean basic changes like:  1. Slightly better AI. 2. Better driving. 3. Improved wanted system. 4. Improved mission giving (No annoying interruptions).  Beyond this I don't think that Cyberpunk will improve in the foreseeable future, but I will at least finish the game.… Expand "

The biggest disappointments for me are the extremely short story.. the sub-par boring side quests (100's of Go kill 4 choomba's standing around, where half the time their AI doesn't even kick in at all) and the sheer amounts of clearly cut content.  Your home has no point or meaning, the NPC's you meet and make choices around just disappear and do nothing in the story.. the car driving is really awful.. there are no unscripted chase sequences or shooting out your window.  The city is completely lifeless, NPC's have zero interaction outside of spouting the same voice line over and over.. you can't enter any buildings at all.. and the ones you can enter are usually just like a empty store.. that sells some random items you don't need.

BUT at some point they became game-breaking, enemies could spot you and hack you through the walls which makes the stealth and covering useless. And the final straw basically was that at some point of the main story my character got stuck in a floor because the only way to get out was getting a key from an npc which fell to his death trespassing the floor making looting him impossible, so yes, at this point I gave up to this game. This is very disappointing.… Expand "

The gameplay is fun and there's some impressive freedom despite a few railroads. I give it an 8 right now instead of a 10 because it lacks some polish all around.  Gun combat feels slow to start, there is some lack in gameplay changing build options, cops are stupidly strong so no GTA like fun, your build doesn't feel like it matters early on, there's a lack of ongoing character customization through a barber/plastic surgery/clothing with the same stats,  there are some funny generally minor bugs on PC, and the game starts off a bit too much on rails rather than let you go free as quickly as an open world game like Skyrim. I expected more sex (prostitutes and even one night stands with random NPCs), cosmetic clothing options, a barber/stylist, optional build abilities (like arm cybernetics or throwing knives) to be much better, to be able to hack more random people/machines for fun and profit, and to encounter more fun random **** with NPCs by walking every 30 meters in the city.  Back to the good stuff: the world feels right out of awesome dystopia scifi movies, I loved the characters, hand to hand combat with a blade works really well, hacking is fun, driving is fun, gunplay has kick and is responsive even if the damage is low to start, must of the bugs are just funny, and there are quite a lot of random things to do.  I haven't played through the entire game yet. This is my early impressions review so far a few hours in. I will try to revise it later. Summary: It's well worth it an RPG like Skyrim and Deus Ex, it's buggy right now, it's really not GTA if that's what you were looking for.… Expand "

You can drive..This is basically a nvidia tech demo with a very very linear open world game dropped onto it. That's the tl dr; This game is not the next gen Deus Ex we wanted.  I've played 52 hours and completed the main story and all side missions. I have not bothered to replay on different life paths because being a corpo on my main playthrough had negligible impact to the game.  You can drive.. you can do missions, you can do side missions, and that's it. Those are the three main things you do in Cyberpunk. There are no extra activities, mini games, or anything resembling a non-linear experience.  The mission system allows a choice of stealth or all out guns blazing.. there are very few dynamic mission choices that allow you to solve problems in your own way. I can't blackmail an NPC into giving me the objective because in a previous mission I found evidence of them doing something nasty. That kind of continuity does not exist in Cyberpunk's world. The most I can do is make decisions which lead down linear paths. Often the same path with an inconsequential alteration frankly.  Unlike Deus Ex or similar games, I can't talk my way past a guard or npc, I can't disguise myself and blag my way into a lounge to steal the objective. I can't choose to steal the objective from the transport it's in or something like that. I can't open a sewer grate and sneak under the building to come up inside the place etc. There are almost never alternative approaches to a mission. It's just a straight linear experience. It's always blast your way in or sneak in, and fetch something.  On the subject of npcs, you can go and talk to an NPC but they just spout a canned one line response. Why can't I have a conversation with them? That has been done in so many RPGs even dating back to games in the 80s. You should be able to talk to NPCs and have a basic branching dialogue. It really should not have been difficult to do this.  There is no player customization, the items you pick up in game are VERY lack luster for the most part. There is one badass gun that Johnny has and when you finally get it they **** nerf it on you. What a **** killjoy.  It's not a living, breathing world where an npc will remember your face and throw you out of a club.  There are many interesting locations in the world and you visit them once for a single generic mission. Inside those places there is typically nothing. No interesting items or things to interact with, just nice decorum if you're lucky. Often the design of bars or places is VERY confusing and poorly signed so you'll end up racing from room to room trying to find this chip.  Picking up items is a nightmare they will probably never patch because I'd say it has to be fixed per item which would be a monumental task.  The game was clearly far too ambitious and they were forced to release it once they had the graphics and story done because people wanted ROI. Well.. jokes on those people a good portion of sales are getting refunded now and I certainly will not be rushing to buy the next game. I'll wait for reviews and reactions next time.  I can only pray they have content lined up for this game because it genuinely is a massive let down if the only thing it has is this Johnny story. I love Keanu Reeves too but I did not expect the entire game to revolve around his story in the game.… Expand "

Shows exactly the level of group think, mob mentality and ability to be persuaded to believe anything. In couple of years everyone will be asking themselves ""why was I hating this game so much"" after watching the ACTUAL GAMEPLAY footage of the game, rather than these very nitpicky glitch compilations.  NEWSFLASH: Glitch compilations ARE NOT representative of what the game actually is 99.9% of the time.

EddieHollywood,"Dec 29, 2020",9," One of the best games of the decade (in my opinion, RDR2 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the two best games since 2000). This game scores above the industry average in every important group of parameters:1) Gameplay. Combat and stealth are equally satisfying. There is no RPG on the market right now that even comparable to the CP in terms of gunfights, melee fights, and stealth (e.g. while shootingOne of the best games of the decade (in my opinion, RDR2 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the two best games since 2000). This game scores above the industry average in every important group of parameters:1) Gameplay. Combat and stealth are equally satisfying. There is no RPG on the market right now that even comparable to the CP in terms of gunfights, melee fights, and stealth (e.g. while shooting in The Outer Worlds, which is #2 fresh RPG, is somewhat OK, there are ambiguous ammo types and too many indistinguishable guns). Smart weapons feel amazing, katana and mantis blades have an enormously satisfying feeling. Finally, stealth and hacking are super interesting. The overall gameplay: best in the industry (comparison: Deus Ex, Outer Worlds, Fallout NV).2) Plot and world. Authors tell us an interesting story about death and one's acceptance of it. Not really Mass Effect level of drama or Deus Ex 1 level of conspiracy, but the deeply private and personal story. Side quests are, of course, amazing (River Ward's and Johny's especially). I, personally, liked the plot even more than I liked the plot in New Vegas. In addition to that, developers used the universe with developed lore, and the back story of Night City and NUSA is interesting to learn. Finally, every question mark on the map tells a small interesting story or shows a funny place. It feels great to explore the world. Of course, it's not the same city as in GTA 5, but RPGs never were really about super alive open worlds (e.g. New Vegas, Outer Worlds, Skyrim, etc.). The overall plot and world: best in the industry (comparison: Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Outer Worlds, Fallout NV).3) Roleplaying. Roleplaying for me is about two things: 1) ability to adjust playstyle (combat-oriented, charming, stealthy, etc.) and 2) ability to express my personal feelings via actions/dialogs. So, 1 - playstyle. I see several potential builds here: assault rifles with dodges, tank with a shotgun, stealth with hacking. Not much, but in Deus Ex HR we had only 1 build that makes sense - stealth (combat is super awkward there), in New Vegas we had sniper, assault rifle, talker, melee plus a lot of room for roleplay with additional skills, such as repair or medicine. Outer Worlds and Assassin's Creed are nothing in comparison. Sub conclusion: good level, not the best (New Vegas), but above the industry average. Now, 2 - dialogs. Yes, that's true, you can only affect the plot so much, but honestly, it's not that kind of RPG that allows you to favor one fraction and destroy the other or that allows you to negotiate in every quest (e.g. New Vegas, Outer Worlds). CP is a more cinematic-like game, and in this sense, the only sensible comparison is Mass Effect, and we can affect the plot way more in CP. But what is more important is dialogues: every time I had an option that represents my personal feelings exactly, and all the other options made total sense (e.g. in Mass Effect you had two ways: adequate character and crazy cruel **** The most important part of the game - V's thoughts about Johny and acceptance of death - offer great dialog options, and I personally felt that I hear answers that resonate with me, the player. Overall: highly above the industry average.4) Artistic execution. Music is awesome, all that rocker boy vibe is amazing, the city looks noir AF and rain and light works amazing in pre designed scenes and just during any night free ride. In that sense, one can compare CP with RDR2, and CP at least slightly worse in terms of light and scenes. Overall: absolutely exceptional artistic work.Final verdict: this game will become legendary and will stay together with RDR 2, New Vegas in the RPG's hall of fame.Ignore all negative reviews - people just hate technical execution, but this is temporary, while all that I described is way more important.… Expand "

V looses everyone and everything, and we as a player get the feeling we have somehow to redeem him, save him, or at least make him unforgettable. But no, the ""happy ending"" is just that V dies nevertheless. There is no point in playing this game at all except to please others, he's just a pawn. if you think, that CD RED announced Cyberpunk 2077 around 8 years ago and compare the actual result to that fact. I guess, it means they basically haven't done anything. It seems like they started working a year ago. Were they Procrastinating? Did they have to change the whole game because of Keanu Reeves joining, basically build the game around him? Ubisoft launches every 2 year a new AC title, which in my opinion is a far better product than CP (At this point of time). I am not sure what really went wrong but honestly, i lost my trust in this company. After spending almost 200h on The Witcher 3, combined with the promotion and marketing and the promises of CD RED regarding CP 2077, i maybe did expect a little bit too much but maybe not though. i don't know, but this could have been THE BEST GAME ever and not a downgrade. But it is just another Anthem, No Mans Sky, and so on..

I am 100% sure CD Project will fix it after few monthes. Therefore I do not include bugs problem in the final grade.  You must be aware: it is not GTA. Car handling, citizens AI, vehicle destruction are very basic, your car is immortal, all chases are scripted, no modding etc. Strongest part of game is quests, story, characters and Night City itself.  CONS: 1. Lack of animations. It seems game suffers from a lack of animations and animation transitions and can`t be repaired by simple patches. NPCs move clunky, collide unrealistically, ""teleported"" to position (if game dont have animation for moving to this position). If cutscene NPC approaching you, you can easily see transition of very poor ""common"" animation to highly detailed ""cutscene"" animation. 2. UI is not user-friendly. 3. No freeRP interactions: smoke-drink-eat-sit-dance animations only in cutscenes.  PROS: 1. Story. 2. Characters are very good written. But main character (V) is not such consistent as Geralt from Witcher 3, mainly because you have much more variaty with dialog options. 3. Directing. CD Project boosted A LOT from Witcher 3 directing. It is brilliant and i think they can compete with TLOU2 directing. 4. Immersiveness. First person view is main part of it. Especially in cutscenes. 5. Music. 6. Graphics is the best in game industry presently. 7. Weapons. Before release I thought weapons will be very basic as car handling. But surprisingly shooting is good and fun. Especially ""nocover doom style"" with perks such as sliding and double jumps. NPC AI is good. Some cover-piercing weapons are forcing you to constantly change locations. 8. Night City. It is most detailed city in game history. Los Santos from GTA5 was great, but now it is technologically outdated.… Expand "

Downloaded it in Gog and regretted spending the effort.I originally reviewed the game about one third the way through, now that I have completed the game, I can provide more details.  Cyberpunk 2077 peaks about twenty minutes half an hour in and goes downhill from there. The game is bogged down in wanting to be cool and fails at basically everything. The setting is derivative, and a poor rendition of the cyberpunk, or dystopian future. The soundtrack is fantastic, its implementation insufficient, errors mean you get the same track running always. The graphics are good but do not provide any extra narrative, extra gameplay, or additional value. It is just visually appealing. The gameplay is lacking, all the way through. The AI if predictable to the extreme. Early on, it would help if you used scouting grenades to identify where enemies are behind cover. Later on, you stop caring, and you use tech weapons to shoot through cover where enemies will be. It is a laughable joke. You can go through significant amounts of fights without actually facing a shot from an enemy. The control system if buggy and limited, it was designed for a hand controller and poorly done. You can be in the middle of a firefight and get a ‘narrative’ section. At which point, you can no longer crouch or uncrouch because the crouch button is the same as the skip dialogue button. You can’t double jump or super jump. You are hamstring, just because the writers want to ham fist in some story. It is a joke. Other internal mechanics are poor; driving controls are a joke, crafting is a mechanism of infinite money and completely devalues ay actual effort on behalf of the player. The script is terrible. It is about as good as the script for Jaws. It’s a joke. And it’s peak is about one third into the game and goes downhill from there. By the time you get close to the climax, it is just foul. You get stuck in a setting that looks like Tron bred with a CRT TV, you can’t see anything, and frankly, nothing you do during that scene seems to matter, so why the hell is it even there? There are flashback scenes that could not possibly change anything and are of absolutely no value other than giving the studio the masturbatory aide of Keanu Reeves. It is arthouse **** with no plot or gameplay value. The missions are bad and repetitive; the story almost absent. Your decisions have limited impact, and you get told from the word go you shouldn’t care. The opening scenes set up what you value in your life and then take it away. You have no reason to continue, none. It is crap. The world feels false and shallow. 90% of doors are locked, and you can’t access them under any circumstances. You don’t care about the consequences; you shoot civilians to steal their cars and have no consequences. But if do piss off the cops, the portal in just out of eyeshot, it is ridiculous, then you run four blocks, and suddenly it doesn’t matter, your warrant disappears. The game is full of bugs, critical bugs, hilarious bugs. The number of times you have to reload because of essential bugs is a joke, it is worse than a Bethesda game, and that is saying something. All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a vapid masturbatory aid of cool with no value, depth or worthwhile gameplay.  If I had to put a dollar value on the game, maybe $20. It is bad.… Expand "

First of all I will comment that I played the game when it came out and I had to leave it because I had many bugs from the first minute. It was version 1.04. In such condition the game was a joke and unplayable. The problem is that more than a year later the game has fixed many bugs but... it's still a joke of a video game.  The story is not bad, although it is not the wonder that CDPR has wanted to sell us. The best thing about the game is the city, yes, it is impressive but it is a shell, it is absolutely empty of content and activities that can be done. Why create a mega city if there is very little to do afterwards apart from the missions? Has CDPR ever seen or played the Yakuza games? They should. Then they would know what true immersion in a game is. Being able to go to tons of restaurants and bars and watch your character eat and drink with even descriptions for all food and drinks. In Yakuza you can play a lot of minigames and very well done and complete, there is everything: karaoke, bowling, darts, arcade games, mahjong, card games, fishing, miniature car racing, pool... and much more. Cyberpunk has none of this, the world is dead and has no activity. In version 1.5 they have added new apartments and in one there is a pool table, the only thing the protagonist can do is push a ball in a scripted scene!!. That's it, absolutely embarrassing and pathetic!  But let's go with the action since it has been shown that the interaction with Night City is practically non-existent. All the missions consist of going to a place, killing the enemies, and so on, repeating all the time and from time to time the story progresses. The gameplay is very repetitive and ends up being very boring.  Artificial intelligence has improved very little, the routine of the NPCs only consists of going from point A to point B and that's it. Again, you should watch Yakuza or Red Dead Redemption NPCs. The dialogues with the street NPC's are absurd many times.  The DLCs of version 1.5 bring very little, the new apartments, some jackets, a stupid look for Johnny Silverhand and some new cars and a couple of new weapons. Oh, and finally being able to change the look of the character in the mirrors. Truly very little to offer to the consumer after more than a year sewing up the tears in the game so it doesn't fall apart.  After all this time this title is no longer defensible in any way, if CDPR is proud of this gaming disaster it is that they are an absolutely mediocre company.… Expand "

However, it's not that the game 'didn't live up to the hype', the game was released in an absolutely broken state.  In my personal experience, the game was getting FPS in the 30s-40s on medium settings. I have a GTX 1060 and that has been the recommended card for almost a year. It wasI had heard nothing but good things about CDPR.  I, like many, was really looking forward to this game. However, it's not that the game 'didn't live up to the hype', the game was released in an absolutely broken state.  In my personal experience, the game was getting FPS in the 30s-40s on medium settings. I have a GTX 1060 and that has been the recommended card for almost a year. It was only a few weeks ago that they added *to reach 30FPS.  In adjusting the settings further, I was able to reach 60FPS but then the game looked absolutely horrible. I feel this is unacceptable with the recommended GPU.  Once I got the game working, however, it crashed on me three times. One of these pauses occurred while I was in the pause menu.  After looking online and seeing that even if I had the latest and greatest set up, the game would look nice but would still have several game breaking bugs. Quests not progressing, Dialog not playing, NPCs in T-Pose... I feel the game was not ready to release.  About the NPCs: I have seen many, many videos of game footage and NPCs seem pretty dead. They don't have routines. They just walk down the street and they might have one or two lines to say. The city is filled with food vendors, but you can only interact with maybe two of them. CDPR promised a ""living, breathing city"" and this is not the case. NPCs also all react to gunfire the same way; you can have 15 NPCs cowering all at once, no variation.  But the worst thing of all is that CDPR didn't allow critics to review PS4 copies, and now we know why: the game simply can not run on the PS4. The FPS hits 15 in many areas, textures don't load, and the PS4 is prone to crashing.  Say what you want about running the game on ""old hardware"", but the bottom line is if the company couldn't get the game to run properly on the PS4, it should not have been released on the PS4.  They knew it would be a bad experience so they attempted to cover it up.  Can the game be fixed? Sure, it can be optimized with patches, as can the quest bugs be fixed.  Can they do more mo-cap and give the NPCs more life? Probably. But my faith in CDPR is almost all gone after this horrendous launch. ""We'll release it when it's ready"" proved to be false.… Expand "

I finished the game and completed the majority of side quests and gigs.  This game was so overhyped to the point where people expected a masterpiece. This game is definitely not a masterpiece, nor is it the 'be all, end all' of RPG's. While majority of fans would've tolerate another delay for refinement, its understandable why CDPR didn't delay the game for another few months.  CDPR really oversold and underdelivered on a few concepts in the game.  - Styles mean nothing in the game. It's all about necessity. You will always choose the most functional sets of clothing to stay alive. Whether its  amour rating or stat boosts, 'The look? Who cares?'. Seriously who cares? You will more than likely equip whatever keeps you alive and makes killing enemies easier. Style means absolutely nothing. - Gangs. In the whole time I've play the game, I have never felt like I had some sort of allegiance with any gang or felt like a favored one gang over the other. One of the 'selling points' in the game before release was how every action has consequences. Outside of any story missions, killing gang members had no negative impact at all. For whatever reason, I was expecting some sort of gang reputation system among factions, similar to New Vegas. - Lifepath means very little. Aside from unique dialogue, whatever lifepath you choose does not seem to have a significant impact on the game.  Visual bugs: - Characters spazzing out randomly - NPCs T Posing while driving, walking down the street, during and outside of cutscenes - V (player character) T posing while driving - Player character losing their hair while looking in the mirror (only happens when characters have a helmet equipped) - Flickering lights. Noticed on the reflection of cars, puddles, TV's and roadside billboards - Cars randomly appearing and disappearing while driving at high speed - Gun models not appearing when player character equips any weapon - NPC's phasing through walls and floors  Audio bugs: - NPCs staying silent during cutscenes, phone calls while player character talks as normal - V staying silent during cutscenes - Dialogue overlapping. V and NPC's having two conversations at once. - Background music going completely silent with only ambient sounds being present  Game-breaking bugs: - Unable to draw your weapons after leaving a non combat area. Problem persisted after reloading a save file. Had to exit the game and verify files to fix. - Unable to summon vehicles after leaving an indoor area. Problem fixed itself. - Vehicles occasionally launched into the air when driving over small obstacles. This includes curbs, rocks, garbage, traffic cones, etc) - NPC's tripping over corpses. Not sure if this is a 'mechanic', but they seem to be tripping very often.  If you can wait 7 years for this game to release, surely you can wait for another few months for CDPR to patch the game and iron out any issues. After that, wait another few months to a year for a steam sale because at full price, its not worth it.… Expand "

My PC specs: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, MSI GEFORCE RTX 2080Ti 11GB, 16GB ram, AsRock x570. I played on ultra settings with DLSS and RTX Psycho mode, but even so, the game disappointed me technically. All reflections in the game do not reflect what is happening around, that is, the reflections are rendered in advance. What about the details? The quality of prompts in the game is also not the best. All the small details such as different bottles, garbage and environmental elements (for example, food or things found at levels) do not correspond to what was shown in early builds. Models of V in cutscenes or during the action of the character show all polygons, and NPCs still consist of curved elements. The city is very beautiful, like the game itself as a whole, but if you look at the details, you can see how everything is rendered and loaded before our eyes, even on my powerful PC. Cars appear out of thin air, and when loading V can pass through other characters. Technically, the game is still at the level of The Witcher 3 of 2015 or even worse. Especially considering everything that the developers showed and promised us, the game can be easily called the most disastrous project in the graphic plan. Even look, Watch Dogs of 2012 was not such a disappointment. Physics in the game didn't do well either. The character goes through corpses, does not interact with them in any way. The collision of corpses is also not at the highest level, especially when it comes to the dismemberment of corpses, which works in an incomprehensible way. The character animations are quite elaborate, but this only applies to the main characters and V himself. But the animation of shooting and weapons leaves much to be desired, but since this is an RPG, you can close your eyes to this. There are a lot of bugs in the game and almost all of them spoil the atmosphere and immersion effect. When you are driving through the city at night and listening to punk rock music (which fits very well into the atmosphere) a car spawns from the sky, gets stuck in a model of your car, and blows you up. The same can be said about mission-related bugs. which not only interfere but also spoil the overall gameplay. By the way, the gameplay is also not at the highest level, but the number of mechanics and the variability of the passage are amazing. But in some places, it can be quite boring, since half of the side quests are reduced to ""go, kill or go, bring (take it to the point)"". Dialogue and story do not greatly improve the situation. In general, in this regard, the game is significantly inferior to the witcher, where all this was carefully worked out and motivated the player to go through all the quests. In conclusion, I can say that there are a lot of shortcomings in the game and I would not recommend buying it on release, although it deserves attention. There is a very shortage of time and hack in some places. Of the advantages, it is possible to note a good, cluster plot and chic composition. Better wait for patches or I think the developers had to wait another year or even two because it seems that the CDPR has been engaged in advertising for 6 years, and for the last 2 years they have started to work on the project itself.… Expand "

Kekkone,"Jan 28, 2021",7," Okay, at first I must say that all the 10/10 and 1/10 or 0/10 reviews are utter garbage 10/10 means that the game is perfect and it cannot be improved (which is certainly false), and 0/10 means that the game is so bad you couldn't even get it running, or you quit playing it after 10 minutes because you hated it so much (which makes you pretty much ineligible for writing a review becauseOkay, at first I must say that all the 10/10 and 1/10 or 0/10 reviews are utter garbage 10/10 means that the game is perfect and it cannot be improved (which is certainly false), and 0/10 means that the game is so bad you couldn't even get it running, or you quit playing it after 10 minutes because you hated it so much (which makes you pretty much ineligible for writing a review because you didn't play it: you should write a support ticket instead or get a refund).  The reality is that this game is about average as it is now. It suffers from bugs and performance issues that will be surely fixed, and it has a bad AI, clumsy menus and pretty unrealistic physics. All of these are things that can be still fixed in the future patches. As an RPG this game is not very good and offers very limited choices, but then again, the CRPG genre is no longer alive at all. However, as a GTA-like action game with some RPG-ish elements such as limited character development and some dialogue, it's pretty decent.  Nonetheless, the game looks beautiful. I'd say after some patches and DLC this could be easily a strong 8/10. I was really hoping for a co-op mode but nah, maybe later.… Expand "

VeryGoodSauce,"Mar  4, 2022",4," This is a review of the game's state at launch and will update that if it improves substantially later on. I'll preface this by saying I've been an enormous fan of CDPR and Cyberpunk for many years and it sucks to be this disappointed with something I was so excited for.  The critics giving this anything over a 7 were very obviously paid. This is easily the buggiest game I have everThis is a review of the game's state at launch and will update that if it improves substantially later on. I'll preface this by saying I've been an enormous fan of CDPR and Cyberpunk for many years and it sucks to be this disappointed with something I was so excited for.  The critics giving this anything over a 7 were very obviously paid. This is easily the buggiest game I have ever played and I'm shocked it passed certification to release, let alone came from a studio that is known for caring about the quality of their games (queue 'not very polished for a Polish game' joke).  Within an hour of play I had hit 6 different progression blocking bugs (""fixed"" by rebooting the game), countless graphical/loading bugs, and was blown away by how shallow the game was. After a couple more hours of play I have still seen nothing special about this game, it is not the ""most fascinating city in videogame history so far"" as IGN puts it, and it does not raise the bar in any way. The prologue we were promised as a Street Kid, Corpo, or Nomad literally lasts 5 minutes. The AI is nearly nonexistent. Interact with NPCs for a second and the simulation crumbles around you. There is no RPG here. Cyberpunk runs, looks, and plays like a game that came out in the year 2000. Getting this to run well on PC is a crap shoot: you either get lucky and have no problems or it's a balancing act of checking Reddit and asking your friends what settings worked for them. Worst of all, the marketing and communication surrounding this game over the years has been nothing but deceitful. They promised some incredible features up until launch day and failed to deliver nearly all of them. This wasn't an understandable issue of ""changes during development"", but CDPR lying to its fans until launch day. This was so obviously a failure on the part of management/production and it makes me incredibly sad and angry that this is what we waited for. Their project scope was sky high and it looks as if they cut back on nearly all levels. In the end I'm left wondering, ""What were they even *doing* for the past 8 years?"" Tweeting?  Because some of what I just shared can be ignored as the angry ramblings of an emotional fan, here are some of the biggest issues and bugs that I've seen at launch:  - Lifeless AI. There's nothing hand crafted about the NPCs, they don't behave in interesting ways, they don't have their own ""schedules"" or plans as advertised. Show the slightest bit of aggression or fire at enemies nearby and they'll forever stay in a crouched, cowering animation. Literally forever, they don't snap out of it even after they've been saved from gang members or the threat is neutralized. Driving AI is nowhere to be seen as well. Leave your car in the middle or even the side of the street and traffic is backed up for miles. NPCs will stop at green stoplights and never start driving again. This is classically seen in games in Alpha or Beta stages but at release? That shouldn't happen.  [Link omitted per site rules]  - Graphical issues. My character is always bald when looking in a mirror, ignoring all hair and clothing. Most mirrors are completely broken, displaying a black box. Character detail is lacking and blurry. LOD pop-in and graphical glitches are everywhere. Placeholder DEBUG text can literally be seen everywhere in the game.  [Link omitted per site rules]  - Next to no character customization (on both personality and visual levels). Your V will look and act essentially the same as everyone else's V. Cyberpunk promised much more than this. Tattoo, limb, body enhancements... everything is either lacking or missing entirely.  - Too many missing quality of life features to list, please see the following thread: [Link omitted per site rules] Cyberpunk literally needed another 6 months to a year of dev time and that still wouldn't fix the missing features and content that were advertised. They knew this was coming and didn't let reviewers use their own gameplay footage before launch to minimize losses. CDPR has absolutely tarnished their reputation, but I'm sure they'll support the game for years to come. At the moment though I would not recommend this game in the slightest and I hope they take this seriously.… Expand "

I read enthusiastic reviews, I thought it was the game of the year. “It will change the video-games world forever”. I don't know how much money took who wrote reviews like that, I can only say that every expectation was completely disappointed. The very first thing that come in my mind is: boring. This game is really boring, it's not an RPG, you have no really choices, it's all set in a one-way-only. The dialogues have poor choices, if any. Everything is so flat you cannot believe it's a 2020 game. The weapons are probably one of the most disappointing stuff of 2077: they're just aesthetics and numbers. A knife can do more damage than an heavy machine gun. The aiming system it's almost the same for any weapon, the optics just magnify a little, the recoil it's the same. If you play FPS you will be extremely disappointed. The only thing that really matters about clothes: numbers. So you can wear underwear with snow boots, because you find them with higher statistics, and you really need their armor points in order to survive. Cars? Just for your private collection, and for some rep points. I never saw such a bad drive system. You can teleport yourself from one part of the city to another with blue points, so don't waste your time and money with vehicles. There isn't even traffic AI. Can you believe that? In a game of 2020.. Motorcycles? Undriveable like cars. NPCs? No AI. Cops are spawned behind you, without even arriving on crime scenes with cars, AV, whatever. Buoldings? You can explore 2-3 floors max. In a skyscraper. It's ok, but don't sell me this game as an open world with infinite possibilities. It's not. Interactions with NPCs on the street? Close to zero. Just a bunch of replies, repeated endlessly. The endgame (no, it's not a spoiler) it's built on forced choices, really bad written. Interaction? You spend an important part of the game as passive observer of infinite dialogues and pauses, which no one feels the need. Sex? It's one of the most ridiculous and false propaganda of CDPR. It's few seconds of boring scenes that has really little to do with their advertisement. Romance? It feels like playing a game of ten years ago. End of review.

Is it really more valuable to you than the community of players that has supported you for so many years, in this case, Russia. Yes, what is happening in the world right now is bad and terrible, but why are YOU game creators getting into this politics?? YOU make games, you don't run politics! The fact that you closed access to your games to the Russian Committee will not change the situation in the world in any way!

Alienware,"Dec 11, 2020",10," No, this isn't GTA in the future. Or Red Dead Redemption either. It's a full on RPG with RPG elements and RPG story-driven pace, and it's one of the best (if not the best) of this generation in that regard. It's not a perfect game, there are plenty of bugs and some balancing issues, but setting a new standard (in city-building, narration) in an entire genre is something worth of the top mark. "
TaliRa,"Dec 11, 2020",2," I'll give this game a point for graphics and a point for music also one point for fixing this mess at least to the point it plays better than CoD: Cold War.  As for the rest it plays and looks like a cheap and annoying version of  GTA.  And did I mention that for most of the time, it's boring! "
bmoney1234567,"Dec 11, 2020",0,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Everyone has talked up the glitches/bugs/performance so I won't bother going into it. It's bad, unacceptable even on decent rigs, but can probably be fixed. What can't be fixed is the core issues with the game. All the marketing leading up to release said ""you can become any V you want to be"". Well, it turns out the three prologues mean nothing. Corporate stooge or nomad you always get railroaded to the same 6 month time skip cutscene and your V is always the same streetwise edgelord no matter what, even if you wanted to be a well-educated corporate stooge on the run he still acts like he was born and raised on the streets. There's no classes to pick from, stats mean very little (I think it's impossible to have a ""bad build"" or one that won't work). Frankly, this was sold as an RPG but it has even less depth than Fallout 4. In Fallout 4 you had Yes, Yes (sarcastic), Maybe, No. In this, almost every choice is Yes, or (Corpo) Yes where the character adds in some anti-capitalistic rant while agreeing. Not much choice. The world seems impressive at first glance but it quickly falls apart when you realise all the NPCS are mindless drones walking straight ahead. Nobody to interact with outside of a handful of key NPCS, nothing interesting happens, no spontaneous moments like V NPCS arguing or having a meal together.… Expand "

Cyberpunk 2077 is a mixture of a handful of games, most notably Fallout and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It is heavily roleplay-focused, and the developers took many creative liberties, some of which are taboo and some of which are gimmicky.  If you are looking for a game to go in guns blazing, then you may want to turn around, since this is likely not for you. You are expected to be pacifistic and only fight when necessary, as you can potentially lock off plotlines otherwise or render the game too simplistic. You have the freedom to decide how deep it is you want to get involved with the world and how easy it is you want to make your experience.  Despite what was advertised, the game doesn't adapt to your dialogue choices. At the end of the day, you return to the main storyline without any repercussions for your decisions. You don't get punished for playing aggressively, so it is easy to Rambo your way through. There is a reasonable effort to get you engaged with the story and its characters, but you usually end up staying in the spectator seat instead.  The world was meticulously crafted to give you a futuristic cyberpunk experience, but it is largely underutilized outside of the main storyline. Plenty of unique side missions are scattered about, but many of them have poorly scripted AI which weakens the immersion. There are tons of bugs in this game that are yet to be patched out, but are mostly minor. (And unsurprisingly, this game is unoptimized and I do not recommend playing unless you have a GTX 1080 Ti or better.)  All in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a decent experience, but a borderline 8 is the most generous rating I can give it (which is primarily for the amount of content that was provided). But, that score assumes you actually have the hardware to run the game. If not, then there isn't really a proper rating to give as you wouldn't be able to even play it to give one.… Expand "
SolRacRG,"Dec 11, 2020",6," This game is beautiful, has exciting and unique music, and an epic story, yet the world beyond what you can see, hear and read is sallow and empty; from not having options to customize your character after the begging, to a dump AI, this game lacks the fine details that make an open-world one you can get lost in.

przeprze,"Dec 11, 2020",8," First of all - yes, the game is buggy. However, it seems to be very dependent on the system. On 1660 super + ryzen 5 with 20+ hours spent I've yet to experience a single crush. Visual glitches I got don't ruin the immersion much - 4 chopsticks in one cutscene, janky lighting under some overpass, a dude appearing out of thin air on the very edge of the FOV.

I've been playing CDPR's games since 2007, I still remember bugs and glitches from the first Witcher like it was yesterday. Bugs in CDPR's games - are just a part of the process, so I would advise being patient (including not rushing to buy it, which the devs themselves repeated over and over).  As for the gameplay - without attempting gatekeeping in any way, there are wrong and right ways to play Cyberpunk. The wrong way mainly consists of rushing it - and inadvertently getting disappointed. Pretty much all the mechanics become better once you've spent enough time and skill points on them - don't expect to shoot like in DOOM right off the gate, and don't expect being a stealthy ninja without investing in Cool.  For me, the game shined once I stopped trying to solve every single in-game problem by shooting. On higher difficulties with low-level char entering any battle guns blazing is basically suicide, but if you try stealth you might find it's on par with Deus Ex and Dishonored minus the special abilities like blink or invisibility.  It is not to say that playing exclusively by shooting your way out of any trouble is a ""wrong"" way. As long as you take your time and play the game by its rules, not trying to mold it into GTA or CoD or even The Witcher, you'll enjoy it. Is this the most ""rpg"" thing ever? Probably not. Is it a good thing? Depends on a person, I guess. Cyberpunk feels a bit more like a truly open-world immersive sim than an rpg, and I don't see any deception here - this is exactly what I've expected based on marketing, previews, and what I've seen with my own eyes.

There's nothing to do in the world outside of killing gangsters and doing side missions, what's the point of putting bars and restaurants in the game if you can't sit down and get a drink, or eat meal? There aren't any minigames to do, you can't even use the shooting range at 2nd Amendement!!! Brain Dances are a really cool concept and they missed an opportunity to turn them into something more - but didn't.There are no NPCs to interact with, you can't even interact with your romance options once their questline is finished. What's the point of building a relationship with them and then just cutting it off? You should be able to have them as a companion, and to accompany you on missions, take them on dates to bars and restaurants. You could do this in GTA San Andreas, and that's 16 years old!There are no ways to customise character in-game or reset your attributes - it's an RPG! Why isn't this in the game? There should be barbershop, tattoo parlours, and the option to change your appearance and a ripperdocs. In a world where people drastically change their appearance, the fact that you can't is mind-blowing!Same goes for your apartment, why they didn't include options to customize them or buy new ones, I'll never know. So much for ""making it"" in Night City.NPC AI is terrible across the board. In combat NPCs stand there and shoot at you. They don't flank, they don't take cover. They stand there and shoot at you.Driving AI is absolutely terrible, I parked my car on the sidewalk with a fraction of it overhanging on the road and the AI just queued up behind it and didn't even drive past. Pedestrian AI is even worse. Shoot a gun? They all synchronise and run the same direction or just squat down in the road. Causing cars to pile up behind them.The police system is, well... probably the worst I've ever seen in a game. Even GTA 3 had a better system. Commit a crime? Police spawn 2 feet away from you, wherever you are, be in in the street, on top of a 10 story building or in the middle of the badlands. No police chases either, run 10 seconds down the road and you lose them. Not once have I seen police actually drive their cars either. It's just terrible.The writing is strong at some points, really weak at others. Life paths don't really do anything except give you some different dialogue options. The way quests are managed too with fixers ringing you up constantly is often overwhelming. Not all is bad about the game though. Night City itself is beautiful both visually and sound-wise. Guns feel awesome too, and there's a great variety. You get some pretty cool ""one man army"" feelings. Cars look beautiful too, inside and out.Overall, except for the world, sound and visuals. It's a pretty poor game. Anthem 2.0. CDPR promised so much but delivered so little. A true disappointment.… Expand "

This was essentially **** But it's also hiding another thing they've absolutely lied to the player base about, which is the open world aspect of the game.  When i first entered the City, i went ""wow"". The game looked just as good if not even better than i tought it would be based on the trailer. The atmosphere is purely sensational. What ruins it for me, is how it almost seems like they try to do everything they can to ruin the immersion. Remember when they said that ""Every NPC is going to have their own life""? The NPC's in this game are the most soulles people i've seen in a video game released in the last 10 years. The only interaction you will ever possibly have with an NPC is them screaming at you telling you what a douche you are when you try talking to them. I've seen 4 kid NPCs so far and each and everyone of them has said the exact same ""I miss i found my sister"" as if that was the only line they codes for kid NPCs. I was fighting with a gang member earlier, and decied to run to a cop to see how they would react. I was next to the cop when the gang member came from around the corner and started blasting his gun straight at me. The cops acted as if there was no one around, until my existence started bothering them too much and they killed me. There are stalls everywhere in the city with vendors behind them yet they don't actually sell anything. They're just an NPC standing there like any other, telling you to **** off if you try talking to them. Customer service at it's finest.  I watched a montage of the AI being terrible but can't find this specific video, unfortunately. It showed how the entire traffic just stopped altogether when one car blocked the road. And not a single NPC tried to reverse and go another route. They just sit in their car waiting for the car in front of them to move, while the car in front of them was waiting for the car in front of them to move and so on. In literally every other open world game that has cars, they try to find another way trough if something's blocking the road. In Cyberpunk, they're given a single pattern they're supposed to drive through, and if something comes on their way, they stop until the object is gone. The AI is quite literally non existent. I've read stories from countless people who've helped NPC's by killing gang members attacking them but the NPC's just stay on the ground scared even though the danger is gone.  The trailers and dev talk made it seem like Night City is a place where random encounters are a common thing and there are a lot of fun things to do everywhere in the city. Am i blind or what? So far after 16 hours of gameplay i've found a hooker and a couple of soda machines that i can suprisingly interact with. I still can't use arcade machines tho.  They had an entire team dedicated for the open world aspect of the game. What where they doing this entire time? Animating the one dude kicking the damn vending machine that didn't work, and proceeding to keep kicking it even after i hacked it to work again? I swear to god, if the visual offering wasn't as sensational as it is in the game, the game would feel like a 15 years old open world. Currently it feels like that too, but just a HD Remastered one. There is nothing to do besides the quests in the world whatsoever.

washawahsa,"Dec 11, 2020",7," I usually stick to multiplayer shooters like EFT, Insurgency and PUBG, and went into the game expecting nothing. I did not pre-order it and tried to limit my expectations to the minimum as much as I could, especially due to the fact that a game with so many years of development with no constant audience feedback (alphas and betas) is bound to have a few issues.

I did not pre-order it and tried to limit my expectations to the minimum as much as I could, especially due to the fact that a game with so many years of development with no constant audience feedback (alphas and betas) is bound to have a few issues.  Also, I run a GTX 1080 with an intel i9-8th gen and granted, in some densely populated areas my frames drop to 50 in medium settings.  With that being said, this game got to me in the first 10 hours. Honestly having excited and craving for more. After that, it became superficial, superfluous, with no real skin in the game. Decisions became mundane with no real impact on the game and defeating enemies was all too easy (even in the hardest difficulty). I felt like a tourist on NC, admiring it, but never a part of it.  Pros:  >Music - never had such an amazing audiophile experience like this. Truly immersive and a masterpiece in all regards (especially on critical missions) >Gunplay - Sometimes a little arcady for my hardcore taste, but when mixed with the melee and hacking and stealth and cover system it ends up being a really fun and exciting combination > Story - really dark and engaging, pretty short from the W3, but still good.  Cons:  > Driving - I've never been a fan of driving games and for me this is tedious and just a means to an end when I want to get quickly to my next quest. The driving system is also quite meh >Ambition - I mention this as a con because of the high number of angry people that cannot play this game properly (even above 30fps) due to the sheer size of the world, which is backfiring on them. Sadly, if you do not have a powerful gaming rig, you will not be able to enjoy this game for now :( >Weapon modifications - being an avid hardcore shooting gamer, I am used to be able to modify weapons extensively. Here you have max 2 attachments per gun (after 12 hours of playing), very poor for an FPS game  It is not a perfect game and it does have a few funny bugs here and there. Sure it needs polishing and optimization, but if you are able to tolerate that (I have average framerates of 80 in low populated areas) this is a fun game, which sadly reeks of mediocrity considering the time they spent on it. Honestly, the game has little innovation to offer when compared to similar titles.  It is a shame that CDPR was not more transparent for our fellow console players and should receive the fallout for it.  Keanu Reaves was a good addition, but far from being a key piece in delivering a game that feels like a 2015 FPS.… Expand "

Many Next Gen owners suffered from significant crashing, making the game almost unplayable, and for last gen players bugs, glitches and graphical fidelity issues result in the game being a disaster. It is also clear based on CD Project Reds refusal to allow console review codes into the market that they were aware of many of these issues and launched anyway. That’s a bad look. All the being said, as a PS5 player, and since today’s patch, this game look amazing and has all the makings of being a mega title up there with Skyrim and GTA 5. Provided that you like open world RPG’s like Skyrim, or New Vegas I think once you get past the bugs and glitches with future patches people will begin to see the true nature of this game. The game looks unbelievable, and thus far has been a lot of fun to play. I personally waited until today’s patch to begin playing, knowing that I did not want some of the release issues to taint my view of the actual game. It ran smoothly on my Ps5 following the patch, and I’m very happy with the game thus far. The strongest advice I can give to discouraged buyers is that you give the dev team a chance to make it right.

Shooting feels great, punching, or chopping people up is so satisfying. 8. The World is vast and sprawling, 18 hours in and I have hardly scratched the surface. There is so much content in this game! 9.  Customizability, you can truly tailor the character to look and feel the way you want. Even keep gear you like by upgrading it or learning how to craft it. 10. The little things...

I've spent so much time just walking around, looking at ads, finding random people to talk to. There is a lot going on, and this game doesn't disserve the backlash.  Final Note: I don't normally write reviews, but seeing that this game is getting so much backlash from the people that wanted it is silly. The amount of effort it took to develop this game is astounding, the bugs will get fixed, and all will be well. There has been enough toxicity this year as it is, and this game is amazing.… Expand "

The Motion Blur is also not to change FPS for me, I just wasn't able to look at that effect for more than 30s and not feeling unwell, so also no FPS testing with it. AND that is the same for me in every other game as well, have to always disable that, or in CP2077 go to low intensity  Next up Bugs: * Seen a few glitches here and there (nothing mentionable, if you aren't looking to nitpick on them. * Driving physics on Motorcycle is kinda strange sometimes, sends you too high up in the air (think that's a balance in play-ability though, because otherwise you could crash to easily) * Hats kill hairs for me in mirrors, so don't look in a mirror wearing a hat ;) * when changing weapons, those sometimes do not properly get rendered and are transparent in your hands until you cycle weapons, or put them back and draw them again. * Biggest one I see, is that scanner sometimes (4 times in 24h) hangs, and you are stuck in scanning. Only once it happened in combat so I had to redo the fight by loading previous save. All other cases could be solved by hitting quick-save and loading it again.  Nothing stopping me anywhere from progression  Missing game elements: * Hairdressers, Plastic surgeons. Would be nice but is. definitely not unplayable. * The rest is nit-picking for me, as there is plenty to do in the world.  General Stuff: Yes there are a lot of games better in certain areas, there are better shooters, there are better driving games, and there are better RPGs. But not if you combine any. Example: Shooter, what does it get compared to? Destiny, Call Of Duty, ... That are shooters! not more, not less. But that's their only mechanic. Our bar should be a Skyrim perhaps, and ohh boy, fighting is just so much better and more enjoyable for me in CP2077 in comparison. And for me also compared to a Division or something like that it is not that bad. Yes bullet sponginess is a thing in CP2077, but an RPG would not work without it, otherwise stats and some loot won't make any difference... Against a Dragon or Mech, you just care less than against humans... And with Swords, against Armor neither  Also in regards to GTA5 as open world Sandbox, (yes that's a chaos sandbox, and CP2077 does not wat to be that, so I don't care about the Police being definitely not on par). But Story Immersion is just way above anything we have seen from Rockstar (I feel being V, that did neither work in GTA5 nor in RDR2 for me). RDR2 has really good story telling, yes but the open world with necessity to hunt animals (grind mechanics) just made me loose interest, and for me the 1st Person is so much immersion. also the Motion capturing of hands is great and helps immersion. And also as a non native speaker Rockstar gives you subtitles. CDPR gives you full audio for multiple languages, with different lip sync visuals(!!!). That's production quality, and texts are not just stupid translations, but all 11 languages are original languages, written in that language, at least for German that is really well done, and better than in any other game yet. Really appreciated.  AND this is my final thing, Immersion in this game is a **** DEAL, Story really gets to you (after prologue, that could be improved a little - NOMAD for me). Characters have multiple layers and are believable in their being. Also the World creates great Immersion for me, and is the most beautiful i have seen, even without RTX.  A lot of negativity is just nitpicking and comparing shooters with an RPG or an Action based Story RPG like CP2077 / Witcher3 with an cRPG like Divinity. In its league definitely a Masterpiece for me around a 91. which as it will get better has to become a 95 easily...… Expand "

I play on PC, and I'll start by saying I was initially shocked at how good the game was. I was lead to believe from initial reviews that the only real issues the game had, were graphical and performance problems. When I started playing the prologue, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that my rig (which isn't bad by any means) was seemingly outperforming the much superior rigs that the reviewers I was following had. I can run the game at a mostly stable 60FPS on full ultra settings, and that's very impressive to me considering my outdated CPU.  I took my sweet time exploring the prologue, spent my first 10 years without even seeing the title card, I was having a very good time. The story beats were fantastic, the writing and performance top-notch, the combat quite enjoyable etc. My biggest gripe was the lack of third person, I knew this wouldn't be in when I bought the game, but after playing I really just couldn't discern any good reason why it didn't make it in. However, after the prologue finished, I noticed the game quickly starting showing its flaws. The bugs feel light from my personal experience, but I must critique the game itself. The game lacks a significant number of features associated with modern open world RPG's, many of which were straight up cut from the game at some stage as they had been shown previously, but many others have been set as a gold standard by fantastic titles such as RDR2, and even CDPR's own Witcher 3. Its gameplay systems feel incredibly dated, as in the way the world feels... well let's just say it's something I would've expected to see out of games that released before this game was even announced, 2 console generations ago. The more I play, the more prominent these issues become. I have so far quite enjoyed the story, but the poor level design, the general un-polished feel to the features that support the open world, and the litany of cut content is now beginning to hamper my enjoyment of the experience.  During the prologue, I didn't want to take my hands off the keyboard and mouse, I was hooked, but this appears to be a puddle that's a mile wide, yet an inch deep, so now I find myself wanting to put the game down and hope for significant post-launch improvements or even mods that will bring the game up to the promised final state.

Although rendering sometimes lagged behind  Music: Another bull’s eye just like in Witcher 3, CDPR amazed us with music that just does “it”. The combat music, the radio, the cut scenes – it just hits you there. Great work!  Animation: Now for the animations… It good. However, it doesn’t match the Witcher 3 quality. Sometimes I really thought that the character models were just broken. The mouth animation is also missed. It lags a bot behind the real time which after some time becomes noticeable and quite annoying. However, there are some advances, especially when it comes to character movement during “talks & walks” it feels very natural and not … artificial like in other RPG’s.  Voice over: I do think that voice overs are very subjective however I often had a feeling that V’s or other characters lines were … out of character/situation. IT really annoyed me. However not as much as Keanu. I am really sorry but as much as I love the guy his voice was stale and empty. It lacked engagement, passion, or emotions.  Combat: CDPR has done it. The combat really differs from the W3 format of “just spam right-click to win”. Weaponry varies it has its ups and downs and there is depth to it! Its genuinely enjoyable! Moreover, multi-classing is easy and genuinely a core to the game. The hacking is also amazing! Quick hacks are done the way Watchdogs should have done it in the 1st place!  Progression system: It was a good concept, however the execution failed in some places. While perks for damage or hacks are great, the system of “need 6 in this category to sue this dialog option” is bad. It does not add anything (or change) while requiring levels. However, use of the stats to unlock faster progression in instances is a great idea!  AI: Sadly, the AI is lacklustre, teleports and spawns behind you and is generally annoying. While the pre-spawned npc’s are absolutely opposite and are great – especially guars and their patrol mechanics. I do hope it will get tweaked as it really annoys the player.  Story line: Its great, CDPR made it once again and shown that they know their stuff. Both Main story and side quests (which I really recommend you do fully) are great and flesh out the world. To be honest the story asks questions that are hard for us and it makes you uncomfortable which is great! It has an impact on you. However… the way the ACT 1/prologue are treated is a crime and joke. The part when we meet Jackie and develop our bond should not be sped up as it is in game. It was an unnecessary treatment.  Characters: Once again, great job! Each character has its motives, way of talking, movement, quirks they are unique which really helps to immerse in this world. It really enjoyable to develop the side story lines and flesh out the world even more. Will not say more, just try it for yourself.  Immersion: A good job, but not a great one. The city feels “alive” but with hours it becomes more and more of a husk. Lack of customization in game (beside clothing) and interaction with the “casual” world hurt the immersion effect I the world. I do hope it will be remodeled as it was later on with W3 too but so far it really bothers me.  Romances: Now, listen CDPR. I have never been so disappointed with in game romances as I was in this game. They are uneven, with only 4 on the board. From them all only 1 feels fully developed while the other 3 are just a throwaway and feel so …. Artificial and forced. Few more quests and it would be so much better! Also, the sex scenes in first person were a mistake. Huge one.  Endings: God damnit, they made me cry again. Even that I reached the final mission way early (do not rush main story please) and focused on side missions after I felt crushed by the endings. Absolutely trashed. They are heavy. Because they affect us out of the game too. I do hope that they will be followed in the future DLCs because this is a harsh way to finish the story and we need MORE… Expand "

The only reason why I'm giving this a 9 is because I actually experienced little to no bugs, sure 1 time Johnnys cig was floating in the air but i saw only around 3-4 bugs and I have around 30hrs of playtime. I really think the game is a 10 if you dont have the bugs, and with the bugs maybe a 7 but I'm sure it can be a 9 for other people as well if CDPR starts working on the fixes. In my opinion the Main Quests were really well made and also the side quests were really good, and had a meaning to them. One side quest was to talk to a police man whose friend died and you can help and talk to him, I didn't really want to help him out and so i chose the least supportive dialogue options and finished the quest. If you speed up time in front of his apartement though you could then see the area locked down and hear one police man talk about how the guy you talked to prior killed himself. This adds a nice reality feeling to the game and I really enjoy it. Futhermore I know alot on people like to **** on the driving mechanics but holy **** do i enjoy riding my bike in 1st person i really like it and I think alot of people just like to **** on everything because the game is kinda hated rn So.. would i recommend this game? No. Even though I really really enjoy the game and have little to no issues with bugs/performance I know that I am one of the few lucky ones and most of the people will experience major bugs/performance issues. Of course I also have some things that annoy me in the game like the police appearing out of nowhere and no customization options once you are out of character creation (also no customization for your apartement), but I truly believe CDPR will change some of these in the future.… Expand "

Original:  Cyberpunk 2077 is a dark, sometimes depressing, dystopian, resolutely adult-only game with an accurate take on the cyberpunk genre.  Gamer discretion is advised : there is violence, gore even, and it doesn't shy from sexual references.  The rendering is beautiful and the music fits well with the atmosphere. The ray-tracing clearly adds the the realism. I've found the story very enjoyable.  The characters I've encountered are well fleshed out.  I love interacting with them, it's fantastic.  It has been a long time since I felt an emotional response to a video game character.  The world feels alive, even if it's for a short time given that violence is never far. During some transitions, I feel like in a good movie. Sometimes a depressing scene reminds me of the original Blade Runner.  If I wanted to be nitpicking, ... One thing that could be improved as far as I'm concerned is the key customization. I've been able to reconfigure what I needed but I would like to be able to reconfigure everything. Also, I've encountered once an issue consistent in one pedestrian disappearing mid-walk.  I've heard some people had performance issue, my machine isn't exactly weak though, and the game is installed on an high-speed NVMe.  This is the best game I've played in a long time, by far : I'm not easily pleased.

But it is so much worse than that. Worst part is the performance. There was no official footage of consoles or lower end PC prior to launch and just as expected, game is extremely buggy and badly optimized. I have PC with specs somewhere betweenI went into this game with low expectations. The hype was through the roof and I knew the game couldn't be everything people wanted it to be. But it is so much worse than that. Worst part is the performance. There was no official footage of consoles or lower end PC prior to launch and just as expected, game is extremely buggy and badly optimized. I have PC with specs somewhere between minimum and closer to recommended settings. I didn't expect high settings, but even on the lowest settings, game often dips under 25 FPS. Bugs are frequent. Most of them only immersion breaking (textures not loading, clipping, NPC talking over each other,...), but I experienced some that forced me to restart the game (unable to pick up items, npc not reacting,... ) and of course game crashes. It was very deceptive to show the game only on the best hardware and only on PCs where they knew game will run great.  Night city was promised to be ""the most believable city in an open world game to date"". So that was a f.cking lie. People in the city are absolutely soulless. They cant be interacted with, only respond by running away a little bit and then just standing still or simply all crouching down simultaneously. They talk to you with their one line of dialogue and that's it. ""Random events"" are very underwhelming. For example scavengers bullying homeless man is just few people standing around crouched homeless man, not doing anything  and if you kill them the saved man doesn't move at all. Police AI is laughably bad. If you kill anyone the just spawn nearby and more you kill the more they spawn. Wanted stars don't mean anything expect for number of spawned cops. If you run away even a little bit, they won't bother chasing you. Driving AI is same story. Like I said cops just spawn behind you, they don't drive cars. There is small number of predetermined paths that NPC cars follow and that's it. If you block a road, they wont deviate even a little bit to continue their path. Driving within a mission is better, but only because missions can be defined more precisely.  Shooting is ok, nothing groundbreaking. Inventory management and equipment could use and overhaul, especially when you're forced to choose between good stats of the thousands of items you pick up and roleplay of what your V would wear and wield. interactivity in open world is sorely missing (transmog, game machines, shops, garage, apartment and body customization, barbershops, tattoo artists, interactions with objects,...). A lot of these features are found in RPG games more than decade old. It doesn't have to be all of them but even some would bring life to this visually beautiful yet empty city.  I didn't beat the game yet, only about 8 missions so I won't touch on story too much. The cyberpunk aspect of game touches only the surface of cyberpunk genre. From what I seen and heard from people who beat the story the game doesn't explore the themes and goals of cyberpunk too much. Dystopian shooter with androids is not necessarily cyberpunk. I may be wrong (it doesn't affect my score too much) and might change this after I beat the game. It's distressing that there is a generation of people for whom this will their introduction to cyberpunk genre. This should have been revival of cyberpunk and instead we got lukewarm corporate friendly ""cyberpunk"".  Musical and art direction is beautiful. It's the only redeeming factor really. People working on this side of the game deserve all the credit they can.  I might revisit the game after some time, when things are fixed and with better hardware and then revise my score. But now, the game is only playable on PC with the best hardware and even there it doesn't deliver the experience promised. Let this serve as a yet another reminder for Gamers™ to not trust corporations. Who am I kidding, they don't care. Flashy game with sexy androids is cyberpunk enough for them.… Expand "

I find it important to write my opinion about Cyberpunk 2077.  With all the respect I have for developers, 2/10 is really a punitive note addressed directly to the board of directors of CD Project. But not only, the marketing and communication departments are also responsible for this failure.  I bought the game on GOG.com. After playing more than 15 hours (taking my time), I've decided to stop to play. This a mature decision that is quite difficult to take for someone that has paid 60 EUR for playing a game.  1. The game wasn't ready I need 1 year more  I'll not come back on the bunch of bugs on the console versions.  2. Scam of the century None of the promises of the game has been fulfilled. They are essential things missing to be at the triple AAA level.  A) The Immersion : The story itself seems to be well written. But you need so much efforts to follow the plot. You don’t feel Night City, it’s a city without any soul. Yes it’s beautiful but it is soooo empty. cockpit view without mirrors, no food that you can eat, no customization, no clothes.  B) The Narrative experience Good plot (so far, I stopped after the apparition of John Silverhead) but you drown under the side quests, calls, SMS from characters you don't know at all. Side quests are just there to fill the game (even most of them are well written) Dialogues are well written BUT are a total scam. Your choices don’t have any consequences on the main story. Even your origin ‘Street Kid, Nomad ou Corpo’ has only an impact on the first hours of gaming.  C) Gameplay Nothing original, lots of copy-paste of previous AAA games.  Fights lack of punch, they are messy. Infiltration is nonexistant. Looting becomes really annoying. Talent tree is just there because it was needed.  To conclude, The total experience is ruined because they are so much négatives aspect that is not worth to continue playing the game. I don""t recognize CDR that created The Witcher 3. I'll come back in two years and see if my review can be modified. 2 years it's long. But during that time, independent studios will maybe take their time to create a new licence that needs our support.… Expand "

And no, I was not one of these Cyberpunk pre-release fangirls hat screamed and shouted at the devs on twitter for delaying the game. I had low expectations for this game since it has been announced, because this massive hype was inevitable. Devs can only reach so far and it was never going to be worth this extreme amount of hype. Back in the day there were no early access titles disguised as finished games for a full price out there to buy. You bought a final product, that at most needed a few tweaks. These days it’s completely normal that a **** unfinished and unpolished game comes out and receives the classic day one patch. What about..uhh.. just finishing the game? Who cares if people have to wait? Uhh... hold on... you make more money by offering preorders and hyping the community up? Okay boys, let’s get em!  I played Cyberpunk on: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 Geforce GTX 1080ti The other specs are not that important. My specs are more than enough to decently play the game.. is what I GUESSED. This piece of crap runs like **** it’s not optimized at all because the devs have wasted all their time putting Keanu **** Reeves into this game. I had the Nvidia software optimize my graphics options for this game and it looked like total **** Weird that Cyberpunk/CDPR run an ad campaign with RTX, right? This is nothing more than a money grab and a very disgusting way of making customers buy a certain product so the game even runs at >30 fps. Characters look interesting on the surface, yet have no depth to them. Oh look, this is a guy. He’s an a$$. Well, okay. Now do missions for him. He’s still bad tho. Uhhh.. yeah that’s it. The game immediately tells you how to feel about people and characters, it does it all for you. Devs put a million people into the city to form a crowd, just to hide the fact that the open world is boring and empty. Oh look, it’s a crowded city! Wow! How amazing! This is worthless! There is no substance to the world at all, this has bothered me about The Witcher 3 too. It all looks so good on the surface but once you step in, there’s not much to do or see. There are no mini games or ""alternative actions""... you can do nothing in this city. Look at RDR2 for example, you can walk around, talk to people, sit down, play poker, drink till you pass out, go hunting and so on and on and on. What can you do in Cyberpunk?.... complete side quests that are all essentially the same or get yourself boosted by your doctor, who is in fact the most interesting character in the whole game. And you don’t see much of his character. Let that sink in. As soon as you step into the car the game lags, at least the characters look good as long as they are in a 2 meter radius. To be blatantly honest, this game is overhyped. It doesn’t reinvent anything, surely doesn’t *invent* anything, god no, all it does is recycle things other open world RPGs did better. Once you’re done with the intro and step into the city to walk around, you instantly realize that all the NPCs are just cosmetic to make the game look like something. It doesn’t add atmosphere, there are neon lights everywhere, police gun you down when you stand next to them for more than three seconds, textures and people appear right in front of your eyes, the game tries to reach a certain performance at any given time so it doesn’t look AND run like complete and utter crap. It’s not worth the $$$ and if I were you, I would wait 2-3 months before getting into the game. This is totally unacceptable and nobody should support this game or these devs/the whole fcking studio. Overworking and enslaving your employees is one thing, but releasing an unfinished game and then STILL overworking your employees because you need constant patching for this game in the future because you avoided finishing it is another. I would only give this to someone as a Christmas gift if I wanted them to suffer enormous cringekicks and a fatal stroke whilst playing this.  Only get this if you have a high end pc, the best RTX graphics card and are a huge, massive Cyberpunk fanboy/fangirl who gives a **** about the studios circumstances, the lack of actual good game design, a laughable story and a world that only looks good on the surface.

Мы плаваем (машина-утюг плывёт по абсолютно гладкой поверхности) на машине по Красивому, но низко детализированному и мыльному городу. Зачищаем местные аванпосты (привет, Убисофт). И убиваем мешки с кортошкой при помощи мешков с картошкой. Такой импакт от боевки.  Сомнительная система прокачки. Напоминает Обвилион. Только Обливион - РПГ, а сей ""продукт"" тупой шутан. Зачем прокачивать взлом, если можно гранатами всех закидать?  Анимация дешёвые и очень простые, их крайне мало. Если бы в игру добавили вид от 3-го лица, то даже RTX 3090 не смогла бы потянуть и в 30фпс 720P в городе. В игре слишком много бессмысленных отражений! И много толпы (её можно уменьшить, но блин, какой в этом смысл? Город без людей?).  В том же Хитман - 99999 людей и ничего не глючит и у тех людей намного больше скриптов.  Люди, машины - все закриптованы  появляться в точке А и исчезать в точке Б. Если проследить за маршрутом авто (на неё запрыгнуть). Достигнув точки Б - машина исчезнет!  Мир пластмассовый, натёртый вазелином, чтобы отражал лучи ХАУНГА. В игре сомнительный сюжет, игра абсолютно пустая, в ней нечего делать. Все механики - рудиментарны. До ума ничего не довели.  Если даже её оптимизируют ( а того не будет, 4 патч, а местами просадки до 20 ФПС не делись). Игра плохая.  Рекорд продаж в стим (или одновременный онлайн) - распиаренная пустышка. Глюченная...

The world of CP2077 is genuinely incredible, both from a technical and design perspective. Night City feels like a real place rather than a playground with building-shaped props. The lighting is mesmorizing. Among games that attempt photorealism, this is one of the best looking games ever made. I haven't found the writing to be on the same caliber as the Witcher's, but it's by no means bad.  This is also the first CDP game to actually have good combat. The shooting feels just as good as most FPS's.  Unfortunately, there's where the praise ends. You should know by now how buggy this game is. If not just check r/gamephysics or r/cyberpunkgame, it's everywhere up there. It even has its own bug subreddit, r/cyberpunkgamebugs. Many of the bugs are merely visual, but some affect the gameplay -- there is a bug where an enemy becomes friendly (sometimes this happens to every enemy in a location, and you just stroll through enemy territory); one where the enemy model doesn't draw behind cover so a floating gun shoots at you; one where the detection meter continues to increase even after you went back to hiding; one where the crosshair continues to show in ADS; police spawning right in front of you; there are so many more. These bugs also happen with extreme frequency. But knowing CDPR, I would expect them to keep working on the game and eventually fix most if not all of the bugs. Nevertheless, the polish on this game ATM is rougher than sandpaper.  There are also lots of things that aren't bugs but just bad designs. The NPCs have extremely simple AIs, they don't react to getting bumped into, drawing a gun in front of them, monkeying around them, and there are videos of NPCs with synchronized panic animations after something blows up. The police stops pursuing you after losing sight for maybe 15 seconds, or immediately if you talk to a vendor. This is especially immersion braking if you become wanted in the story; at one point V basically commits terroism, and after fleeing the scene for 15 seconds the in-game police no longer cared, and after hiding for one night they just come back to the city like nothing had happened.  Prior to the Dec 11 patch, my performance was unsatisfactory. my PC is a midrange i7-4790 / GTX1070ti, and I was getting around 35FPS on low-medium setting. The patch has done a good job in improving my performance, boosting the framerate by 10-20. I feel like the visuals were compromised a bit, but I'll sacrifice visual for a playable framerate any day of the week.… Expand "

Didn't play on native 4K, just DLSS quality & 2560x1440 (on 4K TV w/ HDR).  ...so I was lucky to experience this game at its best, I think...and yeah, I bought that high-end PC not long before it released...after waiting for it for ~10 years...after seeing its 1st teaser in 2012.  I remember the urge to write something here, a review, anything, defending this game, on Day 1...but then I did not. I waited. I played. I played for hundreds of hours, submerging myself in this radically different world, bathing in escapism, to write this review only after at least 1 complete playthrough.  So here we are. I got a maxed out netrunner/hacker, completing all side-quests, and luckily getting a good ending, full of love and hope. No spoilers.  Some people write complete essays, as reviews, about this game. There are tons of video reviews circulating, looking at the game from various angles.  What can I say in addition to giving it a score of 10/10?  I could write a short book about it...but I won't.  21 years ago, in 2000, I remember playing (and completing) the 1st Deus Ex game. A classic.  This game had an impact on me, and provided me with an experience, very-very much comparable to that, if not more...now, 21 years later...which is exactly half of my life...  Half-Life associations welcome ;) ...that too took half of my life, at least;))) ...and Alyx, oh Alyx on a Valve Index, guys... But that is another story.  So: I won't compare it further to Deus Ex, neither Neuromancer on Amiga 500 (based on William Gibson's classic)...which was my 1st cyberpunk computer game experience...not counting AMFV (A Mind Forever Voyaging) from 1985;)  Super-memorable...all that...and all the movies...and books...and this game -- this extremely huge, vast, crazy-brave undertaking -- beautifully fits in that world, that lore, that gritty, neon-lit, heartbreaking and mind-bending virtual universe...  I work in the field of AI. I actually do R&D in AI since ~15-20 years. ...and yeah, the AI (the NPC-s)...oh man...CDPR will improve on that...has to...just as well as the simulation engine (REDengine)... They can, they want to, I'm sure, and they will.  Anyways, I was totally submerged in this creation.  It could be better, as a game, and way more polished, of course.  Just remember: GTA V is out there since 2013...and Rockstar released 4 versions before...not counting the RDR series, and their other open-world games.  If CDPR pulls this off, they should be able to build up their know-how and stack to a point, where they too can deliver similarly polished and perfected mega-experiences.  GTA V is one of the very best games ever made, and to say, that CP2077 is comparable to it, is already an accomplishment.  The systems, that make up a simulated world (multi-agent simulation) are key -- Rockstar knows that very well. Just check their patents on traffic simulation, or anything similar.  CDPR will catch up. They went probably too directly for the ""Holy Grail""...and even though it came out rough (to say the least), it still is a totally immersive, extremely rich and valuable, super-mature and freakin' original content!!  Dive into those stories -- it is just awesome...and the promise, all the promise, of how could this be better (incl. wall-running, which actually I don't care about at all...but people mention on every corner;))) is going to be delivered by CDPR, partly.  They will round this up -- I know.  This game would have needed ~+2 years in very-very well planned and coordinated development.    So, by the end of 2021-2022 we'll probably have something close to the original vision -- something that Mike Pondsmith (creator of the Cyberpunk table-top RPG, and CP2077 advisor for CDPR) thought, CDPR may not be able to pull off.    CDPR had to grow a lot, in technical know-how, and many other ways (not just dev. count) to achieve this...result/game, after The Witcher 3, which was actually much simpler, in terms of the underlying engine, and interacting systems, that create the simulated world.    If I wouldn't have to balance negative scores, I'd give this Unpolished/Unfinished Masterpiece 8-9 out of 10. ...but again, given its current avg. user-score is 7.2, I am giving it 10/10.

I'm played for 10 hours and so far, the only visual bug i've encountered is that the palm trees seem to be on a different plain and seeable at all times. Gameplay is great, the voice acting is great, the movement feels great, looting feels great, the side activities are fun and i'm having a blast playing it. It's really sad that because of base model old gen consoles CDPR is getting a bunch of hate. Instead of pointing out actual flaws such as the lack of ability to customize your character past the creation, the extremely tiny romance options pool (imo there should be 1 character per style, per sexual preference ) and the easily fixable bugs that will go unnoticed like the weapon inventory ui. The game's not a 10, it's a 9. It's, however, not a 0 either. Review bomb **** monetized games and developers pushing unfinished garbage, Cyberpunk 2077 is a really good game, however it hasn't even been a week since it launched, if the occasional car despawning/ enemy popping out of nowhere bothers you so much, just wait a month.… Expand "

Cyberpunk2077 is also the most disappointing game I have ever played in my 25 years of gaming.  You have to ask yourself, did CD Projekt RED deliver what they promised? and did they meet expectations with Cyberpunk2077? Because for myself, they certainly did not.  Found this review on Steam, and I thought it encapsulated the game perfectly for me: Let's start with the character customization. In all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this game would be about. What we got, however, was unremarkable. Aside from customizable genitals (which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character) this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games, and in a lot of areas, it had less. Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. In terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. To make matters even worse, once you've created your V, that's it. You can't change your appearance any more. Despite the fact that the ads implied in Night City, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. Not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics.  The next thing I want to talk about is character choice. Aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over V's personality or choices. V essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. For example, I chose Corpo as my lifepath. After the very first introductory mission, V went from being a cold, calculating Corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. I had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes.  The world itself was also a let down. I went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. But what I found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. Yes there are tons of NPCs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. It is completely static, and the AI leaves a lot to be desired. As many have already pointed out, the AI seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. That's it. The police AI are a complete joke. If you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. In the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere.  The story definitely had it's moments, and I did very much like the ending I got. I was very disappointed that you do not get to go back to Night City afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. Instead, you are simply given the opportunity to go back to your last save before starting the final mission. I found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.  The cybernetics and gear system was weird, to say the least. Even playing on hard, I never had any reason to get into crafting or cybernetics to be powerful enough to get by. I wanted to get into cybernetics more, but even doing all the side missions and gigs didn't yield enough money to be able to afford the good stuff. By the end of the game. I had only added one or two new cybernetics to my character.  I was also disappointed with V's apartment. You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. On top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. Yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. I also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. You spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point A to point B.  This is tough, because if it had been advertised as what it is, I might have thought it was a really good game. But aside from visually, this game was not nearly as deep as I got the impression it would be. Part of the blame lies with me, after the Witcher 3 I had faith that CDPR would deliver another masterpiece. That was an unrealistic expectation I realize. But at the same time, I don't think anyone can deny that this game is not what we were told it would be. Yes it was probably largely the media that made expectations so high, but I do believe that CDPR did, in this case, overpromise and underdeliver.… Expand "

There is a caveat for me though because after a decent amount of time you will notice its not the RPG CDPR promised which I find somewhat dishonest. The choices have minimal impact on the story and in its current state I'm a little disappointed, especially since the open world quests and the better side quests stop cold turkey up to a point at the end of the game and game breaking technical issues. Its still an 8/10 but CDPR does not get a free pass from me. Play it when the game is in a better state unless you feel you really need to play it now.… Expand "

This one takes the cake overshadowing every other entry in the genre.  The story takes every great elements from books like Neuromancer, movie references from Blade Runner and many others, modern themes as well, and meshes everything together into a masterful dark themed world. You will fall in love with a lot of characters and create bonds in a city were words like relationship and friendship are absent.  The game was facing a harsh launch due to a premature launch especially on last-gen consoles but right now the Cyberpunk 2077 is more than playable. Sure there are some missing features but the games gives you subtle hints that those are gonna be added in future Free-DLC exactly like those in The Witcher III.  It's pointless to say that the game is visually gorgeous with and without ray-tracing. It gives you plenty of screenshot possibilities with a Photo Mode like no other video game. If you're curious you can check what I've uploaded on Steam Cloud or on my Instagram called @nightcitydaily.  After finishing the game twice and tried every ending I started developing a hobby for exploring every corner of the city in search for weird, beauty and extravagance. Night City is a masterpiece of world design. A well-crafted Open-World map that hides small details in every corner of the streets. There are some minor visual bugs and glitches but nothing game breaking like I found in other RPG's, nothing unfixable.  My final point is that no matter your style or preferences, Cyberpunk 2077 will provide a great gameplay experience, amazing visuals, great story-line and characters, outstanding voice acting, and spine-chilling setting. You'll understand once you pay some attention at the world and compare it to real life. You can call it a caricature of what we live right now.  Give it a try and don't get consumed by hatred and media who earn money from blame and chaos like a parasite. Not even me or my review. Please think for yourself and be your own judge!  See you on the streets of Night City!… Expand "

Questionable skill balance, mediocre character creation. Fun game.  Didn't find too many bugs, but one involving Jacky and a gun fused into his hand really ruined the immersion and story telling for a particular cutscene. Again, nothing that made the game unplayable, just wish it had some more polish to it.  Aside of bugs, my only gripes about this game are the clunky feel of the default controls for keyboard, and an underwhelming character creation. It's 2077 and I should be able to craft flawless waifus with prefect skin and everything, and yet I'm stuck with something that is distinctly human. Jokes aside, I wish it had a character creation as detailed as something like black desert online, or at least tools like more hairs, sliders, sculpting, custom RGB color selection, etc. for your characters to have the potential to look that way.  I haven't finished the story so I can't provide feedback on it, but so far it hasn't disappointed. Can't say that its perfect, as I feel like I'm forced to play as V, rather than my own character unlike other open world RPG like Skyrim.  In terms of skills, its horribly unbalanced. 20% of perks are very powerful/useful while the rest are either too situational or the effects are too underpowered. But I guess it rewards people who understands the value of each perk?  tldr; this game is great. not perfect, but fun. lets hope cdprojekt red fixes the bugs so more people can enjoy the game the way it was intended to be. would give it a 9/10 but 10/10 to counter the review bombings… Expand "

What I will say is it is a good fun game. I’m enjoying the game and happy with the purchase. However, I did not have the hype expectations that others had.  Here’s my breakdown and very early impressions.  This is a narrative driven game, that must be emphasized.  What that means is the world you will be hearing a lot about in reviews and discussion takes a back seat to the narrative. Most of what you will be doing is talking to important characters and progressing multiple story arcs. I’m not saying that in a negative way.  The hype: The hype for this game was overwhelming. I was one of those people that didn’t have very high expectations for this game. If you did come into this game thinking it would be revolutionary or change gaming for years to come you will be disappointed. I will say, from my perspective, it was cool to play a game on launch day that had so much hype. It’s cool to get in on the ground level of a medium like a season premier of a beloved show or hotly anticipated game such as Cyberpunk and experience it along with millions of other people in your generation. It was a first for me and I truly did enjoy the moment.  Now, I did not believe going into this game that it would be what everyone was praising it to be. I was not disappointed. My expectations were realistic coming in.  Gameplay: The gameplay is average. It’s honestly a fun game but again it’s nothing groundbreaking.  Let’s talk about combat. I find the gunplay to be fun. It feels responsive enough for an RPG. It doesn’t do anything special and it doesn’t critically fail in any arena. Just as a side note so you can compare my perspective to your own; my favorite FPS game for the past few years has been Escape From Tarkov.  Onto the driving, It’s not atrocious but it can be a pain in the dick with mouse and keyboard. I find driving in first person very difficult while driving in 3rd person is manageable with some time.  I refuse to play games with controllers but if you don’t mind and want a smoother experience while traveling around it may be worth it and may bring a more positive experience to your time with the game.  The AI is not the most ferocious of adversaries and their driving is pretty abysmal so just watch out.  Bugs: I’m sure you’ve heard so I’ll keep it brief. Yes, I’ve experienced a fair amount of bugs that left me scratching my head as to how some managed to leave the testing space. Some were game breaking and required reloads or even restarts.  Graphics: Looks good and plays well. I’m running a system that I would consider High end even though my hardware is outdated at this point. I have a I7 6770K - paired with a 1080 TI and 32 gigs of DDR4 at 3200. I’m missing out on the RTX but the game runs well with settings at the highest settings. I have a high refresh rate monitor and experience smooth gameplay.  Atmosphere: This is probably the most talked about aspect of this game. I don’t agree with everything people have said about the atmosphere of the city. It has been lauded for being the most livelike city people have experienced. I disagree with this. It’s a very cool looking place don’t get me wrong but the NPCs in the crowd feel like NPCs from any other game you have played. I would even say that the crowd structure of this game doesn’t do anything different than a game like Oblivion or Skyrim.  It’s cool, but I  enjoyed the narrative experience far more than I did being in the world itself.… Expand "

Biggest issue i can name so far is: you will be playing, loving the story, the quest will be setting up for what generally you will have to do. This part is pretty much flawless with minor bugs. However when you actually have to go and do the mission this is where the game took a back seat. Many things are unfinished, untested, and have a very scripted, one-way play feel to them. There doesn't seem to be a freedom in how you can do a mission, otherwise it will break. AI as you've read by now is non-existent, and i will go as to say that there are missions that will break your heart because you thought that the 'fundamentals' would at least work.  In fact i have stopped playing after 45 h, since there are things so obviously broken that i almost do not wish to continue, because it hurts me knowing such an epic game has such epic issues.

Then there are the random bugs that should not be making it inot final release.  Like cars and other items that just float.  Very overhyped peice of ****  Grahpically decent but certainly not close to next gen in any way.

Vikn01776,"Dec 11, 2020",10," For all its bugs and some very odd design choices/omissions (Unchanging hair/facial hair, no walk key on PC, a few others), this game is a 10. Normally, bugs alone would relegate a 10 quality game to a 9. But in this case, what they do well is so far ahead of any other game that it truly makes up for any annoyances, and then some.  The most simple thing I can say about why CyberpunkFor all its bugs and some very odd design choices/omissions (Unchanging hair/facial hair, no walk key on PC, a few others), this game is a 10. Normally, bugs alone would relegate a 10 quality game to a 9. But in this case, what they do well is so far ahead of any other game that it truly makes up for any annoyances, and then some.  The most simple thing I can say about why Cyberpunk deserves a 10 is as follow...  I have felt as much like I was in another world as I do in Night City. Not even close, not by half. Most of the issues seemed to have been fixed a few weeks after release, in terms of technical stuff at least. But making such a massive, DENSE, detailed, moving world from a 1st person perspective jumps over the next several steps in a natural progression of gaming tech. For those leaving fully negative reviews, they either lack a basic understanding of technology and expected it to run on a low end PC or last gen console (tbh if I realized this with my technical idiocy, no excuses) or they were raised in a manner as to project their expectations outward and have a tantrum comprised of impotent rage and narcissistic petulance.  MAYBE no mission line is at the moral complexity and is as deep as the Bloody Baron's, let's say that's a 10/10, but the sheer amount of 8/10s and 9/10s EASILY compensated for the lack of a ""Main story within a main story"" microcosm.  Night City may be slightly smaller than the Witcher 3's world map, but taking into account the 1st person view, the density, the detail, the verticality and other such factors, it not only feels larger than that map, it feels larger and more purposeful than any game's map to date. Never has any dev come close to the feeling of creating a REAL city in fiction...with a believable scale, populace, culture, etc. This is truly a new benchmark by which to judge any game's setting going forward.  To actually believe their negative reviews, the degree to which one needs to hyper-focus on the negative and ignore the tsunami of positive is truly shocking. The density and detail of missions, the perfection of Night City, the high quality story, unique ""class"" progression..so much of this game blows EVERYTHING else out of the water. They shouldn't have released it on last gen, but the amount of limb flailing, snot covered tantrums that the famously spoiled sect of gaming fandom would have resulted in riots had they skipped those consoles.  The worst of fans wanted CDPR to use black magic to make a game that's 10 steps ahead in terms of technical achievement to run on systems 5 steps behind the average PC. So a quick personal thing...I got this at the same time as I got Horizon Zero Dawn. The latter would completely monopolize my gaming time in any other situation. But after  playing both for a few hours, EVEN early with all the bugs, I could not justify putting any time into HZD. It just felt like I was playing a great example of old gaming when I had the next step right here.… Expand "

I'm going to make it short: until the very end, there are no choices that matter. Only your decisions in the final mission really make a difference... for nothing, because you can't remain in the world of Cyberpunk post-ending. This lack of continuity, in which you can't remain in this game after all is done and waiting for future content while you do side quests and additional content, is what bothers me most. The game will force you to return to a save state previous to the final mission. You can't see how the world of Cyberpunk lives on after your story, or should I say, the story of Johnny Silverhand? Because most of the time it feels like they are forced to give him more protagonism since ""he is Keanu Reeves"".  Being first-person only even strengthens this feeling that you are just there watching how things happen in front of you, without much to do there.  There is only 1 light machine gun and 1 heavy machine gun in the game. You can't customize your cybernetic implants and see them, because you never see your character.  I think the development of this game started to go downhill the moment they decided to make it an FPS. Most of the time it does not feel like an actual RPG, and you feel like you're just playing some sort of futuristic first-person GTA.  The problem with this game is that many of the things that they kept promising over the years are just not there. And as a consequence, the players feel scammed.  You can't upgrade or customize your cars, or your house, most of the nicest vehicles in the game, you can't have them. Some of them, you can't even drive them. 90% of the doors are locked and there is no way to unlock them. Not even with the tech skill that is supposed to do exactly that. I came to realize that the content is just not there, so the game can't show you what's inside.  When you see all those amazing flying vehicles, you start to think that later in the game, you will be flying them in this so-called ""vertical"" city. But nope. You never pilot or have anything of the sort in your possession.  In the end, you can't promise so much and give so little. And the little you give, so buggy. I am left disappointed because it lacks continuity and that's not what gamers expect today. They created a 2012 game in 2020, so I can't stop thinking maybe CDPR was never the right developer for this game. Other studios could probably do better.… Expand "

As for the rest, I have no complaints about the game; rather, on the contrary, I am ready to praise it for the staging and quality of animations (which, by the way, tend to break. Hee-hee.). For some reason, people expected, first of all, a clone of GTA, and without getting it, they whine about the physics of machines and the lack of development of the open world. I want to remind you that this is an RPG, which means that the open world is primarily a decoration (very, by the way, beautiful), and cars are nothing more than a tool to quickly move from point A to point B. In RPG, the plot is primarily important and here with him everything is just wonderful, believe me. Those who write the opposite, well ... They just want to write at least something in order to put their coveted zero. First of all, for the console version, which works really badly, but in my opinion this is not a reason to underestimate the PC version of the game. Although even on a PC for $ 1000 fps sometimes sinks below 30. However, when you start following the plot, you will most likely close your eyes to them the same way I did. In conclusion, I want to say that this is primarily just a good game that has become hostage to high expectations. People were not given their wow effect and now they are ready to whine and destroy (believe me, in the original, not translated text, there was an extremely funny pun here). I would give it no more than 7 out of 10, but since most zeros are absolutely not justified here, you have to overestimate. As the saying goes: ""Haters gonna hate"". P.S.

dapperstache,"Dec 11, 2020",6," When this game is firing on all cylinders, it looks nothing short of stunning. One of the big complaints with Witcher 3 was the lighting engine downgrade, which had ripple effects through many other aspects of the game. Textures and geometry were also downgraded, sometimes significantly. That is not the case here. Textures look stunning. The lighting is absolutely excellent. The one minorWhen this game is firing on all cylinders, it looks nothing short of stunning. One of the big complaints with Witcher 3 was the lighting engine downgrade, which had ripple effects through many other aspects of the game. Textures and geometry were also downgraded, sometimes significantly. That is not the case here. Textures look stunning. The lighting is absolutely excellent. The one minor complaint I have is with rain. Rain that falls on surfaces, like windows for example, looks good, but the actual rain itself isn't the least bit impressive. A game that did rain correctly was Arkham Knight. The rain in Cyberpunk is more like a flat, semi transparent white sheet. There is no refraction present, so I am not sure if it's a large texture sheet or clustered (or individual) raindrops. This is likely a tradeoff made to not worsen framerates. I only mention the rain because it's sort of a staple for Cyberpunk as a genre. Everything else I have seen however, looks phenomenal - including RTX features - with the downside being that RTX absolutely tanks performance. This might not be as big of an issue had we not seen what was essentially paper launches from both AMD and Nvidia - but judging from people with those cards, they are faring only slightly better.  Optimization is atrocious. I say that knowing full well that ""optimization"" doesn't happen with the press of a button. It takes time. Unfortunately, CDPR didn't take enough time. GPU utilization ebbs and flows on the low end for me (2080 Super) anywhere from 25-40%, while CPU usage (3900x) is hovering nearly maxed out. RTX randomly slows the game to a crawl on a 20 series card, regardless of if I am running in 2560x1080 or 3440x1440. DLSS manages to keep the game from dropping down into single digits, but I experience regular and persistent drops into the low 20s. There are countless other issues as I mentioned earlier - NPCs floating, weird physics, disappearing or magically appearing cars, light rays flickering, light sources like muzzle flashes visible through walls, etc. These are the types of issues that, like it or not, have become baked into large AAA launches. I won't be too harsh about it, because ultimately, I fully expect that these performance issues and bugs will be addressed - and done so pretty early on. Nothing can compare to Arkham Knight's disastrous launch on PC, where WB actually pulled the game off shelves and Steam for the better part of 2-3 months, at least I hope.  Some of these performance issues however seem to be tied in part to crowd density - which brings me to another point of contention: Just what the hell are these NPCs doing? Very few appear to have actual routines. Many are spawned in from nowhere as you enter the surrounding area and despawned when you leave. Turning around and going back and you will see completely different NPCs occupying the same spaces, clipping through each other. There are relatively few vendors that you can actually buy ♥♥♥♥ from or interact with. Contrast this with Kingdom Come: Deliverance - another game that runs rather roughly even today. KC:D's NPCs all have functions. They all have routines and jobs. Very few here do, and while the variety is far greater than what we got in Witcher 3 (with parts of faces, hair, eyes, mouths and clothes swapped around in a half dozen different configurations), it isn't difficult at all to see identical NPCs standing right next to each other.  Furthermore, this problem affects gameplay. Cops spawn in from nowhere. Shoot someone in a closed alleyway, and watch as NCPD magically appears and starts blasting. Contrast that with KC:D, where guards would actually come from guard towers, where crimes actually had to be witnessed. The AI is also notably unintelligent. A cop can get blasted, laying on the ground, while another cop stands there bored. Shooting in public will make half the NPCs cower down, while the other half walk about like nothing has happened. Can we really call this next gen with a serious face? I understand that implementing any sort of real solution to a game of this scale would be problematic, and I am confident that I don't have a solution - but Cyberpunk's multitude of issues with NPCs and AI should frankly be an complete embarrassment for CDPR. Even worse than that is that it isn't something that will likely be fixed quickly (or possibly even at all without official modding tools, as that would require some major AI and scripting changes.)  As such, at this point, I am honestly more inclined to say wait a month and see how things progress.… Expand "

Even bought collector edition. So i was pretty hyped but there are tons of things that killed it in me. So I will starts with cons• First of all bugs - I don't think there are any aspects of the game that aren't broken. NPCs, floating guns and cars, looting system, AI, audio, interface and the list goes on. It's not like those bugs are any kind of game breaking but you get them constantly. You want to change car camera? Well, first you need to leave car. You want to loot something? Stand on it and stare down. Tons of characters don't even open their mouths.• Performance - I might not have a killer PC but holy game automatically started on ultra - nice. I'm not.gojng to talk about fps(got around 60 when went to medium settings), but the whole game renders so fu❤️king long. You can just run it o character and it will look like pre 2000 NPC. Same goes for cars. You often need to zoom into them for game to render them properly. Same goes with your weapon. Running with invisible katana is horrible. Overall the game looks nice, it has nice graphics when they works but I've experienced so many ugly animations so far that it's unbelievable.• Lack of content - you can't customise your character during the game, you can walk, you are forced to wear cloths that give you good armor and look horrible. Skill tree might looks huge but overall it seems to work like weapon modifications / most of the stats doesn't make sense. Broken economy, broken crafting. Also your screen is almost whole.the time full of some information which is distracting• And one more time AI is broken. Police spawns in dozens of unites in a few second but when you run for 20 secs then just give up on chasing on you. Drivers will always stay behind your car. Enemies often just stop shooting at you or it takes seconds for them to realise that someone is shooting at them. Stealth is horrible, after spending hounded hours in dishonored and Deus Ex I don't even consider trying it - it's so horribly dumb and scripted. Also interaction with people was better in postal So much for negatives. Didn't make whole story so not gonna talk about it for know. How about good things?• I like the combat. It's dynamic and satisfying. It's probably not everyones story but after you level up with your guns it becomes more and more fun• Its generally entertaining. I'm currently doing some basic quests but the whole lore and SF atmosphere really works out for the game. City is full of activities you can just encounter and discover • City is amazing. It's really big, beautiful and full of things to do. Looks amazing at night. Never even thought about fast travel• Music is dope as fu@k. Both score and radio are amazing • Quests and story so far are great. You really want to dig some others characters story I still recommend this game. I know that CDRP will definitely fix it and will work on it a lot (although they really lost tons of respect, currently game is not even close to what they promised on social media). It feels like good game but that's it. I was really hoping for 10/10 game but the best it can get is 8/10. It just lacks too much and doesn't deliver in many basic aspects of the gameplay. If CDRP take more care of it then it probably can almost become what Witcher 3 has accomplished. For now it's just better to wait and hope for patches. They now that they screw up, they know that it's not final product and that there should be another delay, they are not blind. The only thing is how king will it take to fix it. Game is in horrible state right now. Enjoyable but it just hurts how much potential they have wasted. If you are not in a hurry - don't buy it now. Cyberpunk 2077 has a lot to offer but right now you might just not feel it.

It has its moments of genuine excellence in the odd side quest but feels curiously like an amalgam of elements of various games hammered together not always successfully or coherently.  I get the impression that the game was meant to be a visual feast to cover over a whole host of things which just aren't quite 'right' but that feast is currently gated behind a fantasy PC build for most gamers, and even the next step down limited by supply of the GPUs with the needed features.  Personally, I was hoping for a game which would take on the cyberpunk genre with thought but this is really more in tune with Altered Carbon than Bladerunner 2049. You're left wondering whether subjects and issues are thrown in just for the tittilation rather than from any desire to engage seriously with them at any level beyond the most superficial.  In the end, I've found it to be a cluster of cliches bathed in ray traced lighting. As vapid and insubstantial as the clouds of smoke filling each room and corridor.… Expand "

But than after that first 5 hours, the game gets boring real fast. When you first open up the map, you are overwhelmed by the amount of  markers and waypoints sprawling across the map. But than you realize it's only 3 fetch quest, dotted all over the map, with a couple of side missions here and there. The story is pretty decent, but not good enough to pull me in. The game looks gorgeous and night city looks incredible, but underneath the glowing lights and bustling buildings you see and empty game with no soul. NPS's are stupid, struggling to even walk in a straight line. Instead of getting into high speed police chases, like in GTA 5, police just spawn behind you. They don't even use their cars, so if you commit a crime, you can just drive away and wait for them to stop spawning. It is an extremely disappointing game that is leagues below The Witcher 3.

They do not react to you blocking the streets, shooting at their cars, hijacking their cars.- No character customization after the first initial set up.

The cops cannot chase you in everyday car chase because they do not have the drving AIs- Sex was also a big selling point of this game, but in reality, you get to choose either a woman or a man, watch a 20-second cutscene, and that’s it.

The graphics look really modern (the style of the city is something else). There are bugs though but the latest fix 1.0.4 fixed some of it. I'm sure they will patch it out asap. The PC version of the game is the best. I really feel bad for those console guys (PS4 and Xbox One).

I believe in a few months once the game is patched up every one will be singing its praises. I'm not excusing the bugs and CD Project Red clearly has their work set out for them, but we should judge a game off of what it is and not the fixable issues it has at the moment. I've noticed that alot of gamers online love to jump on the hate bandwagon of anything just for the fun of it (see The Last of Us part 2 leaks). And yes the game does have some bugs, for me it has been nothing too serious and game breaking but I do understand players frustration with buying a $60 game and getting a buggy first couple of hours. Games of this scope will always have bugs at launch and people seem to forget this every time the new shiny showstopper game comes out. Give the developers some time and patience (something alot of ""gamers"" seem to dearly lack) and this game will be up to snuff soon enough. Dont always buy into the hype both positive and negative, make your own opinion on games, dont just listen to Youtubers who are using this to get your clicks. play the game and finish it before you decide whether or not it is good or bad dont be sheep. I give this game a 9/10 on pure potential and  7.5/10 on current state of the game which will be patched up in no time.

People are complaining about console performance on the PC portal, shows just how 'critical' are these 'wanna be' reviewers. I will try to appeal to a reasonable reader that does not see everything in black and white (or either 10 and 0 scores).  Graphics and hardware optimisation: This is a PC ONLY discussion, therefore console buyers should skip this part. I understand the frustration of the players that have a GTX 10 series or older gpu, not being able to run the game smoothly and at high settings, however the RTX users have a great time, mostly because of DLSS. Even an RTX 2060 with DLSS on can run you high to ultra settings at 50-60 fps. is that unreasonable for a gpu that costed $349 MSRP at launch? The old hardware struggles, and rightly so. The raw performance, architecture, VRAM, everything has changed so do not expect to run this game with your 'hard earned' GTX 1060. *CONSOLES* Your PS4 was launched in 2013, you should have a brain of an amoeba to think that you could run the game on a $400 console from 2013, despite the promises. My advice to you: Be sceptical of everything in your life. Back to PC. People saying that CDPR are untalented are absolutely blind. The lighting is so well designed, that in most cases you do not need RTX ON for it to be realistic. Textures have lots of details. A variety of settings to tailor the graphics to your hardware. The only complaint really is the skin and character animations. They are not as realistic as TLOU 2 for example, however more than acceptable to enjoy the game. I guarantee that reviewers that complain about low fps, poor graphics etc. run a non RTX gpu. If they do and still have issues, then they have issues (not with the game). Don't believe me and this review, go and check the youtube, and I'd highly recommend the 30 min LinusTechTips video. Another advice: if you have old hardware play on Geforce Now or Stadia.  Gameplay: I would like to see at least one critical negative review of the gameplay and RPG aspect. I laughed so hard at 'spencieboi' opinion that RPG system is either boring or non-existent. He clearly did not open the menu to see that there are 5 main attributes, 2-3 categories for each attribute, and about 20 perks for each category. Do the maths. There is a lot of freedom of choice. You choose the clothing and fighting style, weapons, stealth or berserk, cyber implants etc. Is that not enough RPG? Even The Witcher 3, people's most favourite, has less RPG elements. The dialogues are well written, and only a child will not be able to follow a conversation, even if they use seemingly futuristic language. The choices you make do not necessarily change the outcome, but the means you get to it. I am not going to spoil anything so you will have to see it for yourself. Even though there is a lot of freedom in this game, it does not reward the player for killing random npcs, and the NCPD are going to issue a warrant to kill you, as well as other netrunners coming for you. The weapons feel real, maybe CDPR got inspired by CS GO and its physics. Is it a looter shooter? Perhaps. Is the looting essential like Destiny or Borderlands franchise? No. You may have weak weapons, the attribute level and perks are going to boost you, and vice-versa. An issue here is the balance of the perks. Obviously it is hard to balance out the value of different perks, therefore only the future patches are going to indicate whether some skills are OP or not. This game is not just a shooter, or a slasher, or a stealth crawler, it is a combination and you decide how you want to play it. Isn't it what RPG means? Or do people desire for God of War and The Witcher 3 RPG where the changes in gameplay are minimal and don't require the player to use his brain.  Bugs: The bugs are certainly present. The question is, whether you are lucky enough to find a few cosmetical bugs e.g. npcs walking over cars, being stuck in textures, weapons being invisible etc. I have not experience game-breaking bugs, crushes, stuck quests etc. Maybe I was lucky enough, or maybe people exaggerate the seriousness of the bugs. I REMIND YOU THAT THE REVIEW IS PC ONLY. Console bugs do not concern me and I frankly do not care.  Conclusion: Buying a game at launch, you sign the 'early adopter' title, whether the game is buggy or fully functioning and perfect. Do not expect the game to be playable on any hardware. Do not expect the game to be a 'smash a button to win'. Use your brains. Read into the skills and perks. Let the game lead you into its mechanics, it does it really well. If you cant afford the hardware to render the game on your system, you have cloud gaming option, and you will be shocked how good it has gotten. Please readers of metacritic, don't be manipulated by negative or positive reviews, not even by this one. Form your own opinion.… Expand "

The lighting is 10/10 even without ray tracing but with RT all shadows, reflection are getting a huge upgrade. The Ambient Occlusion is well made. I love that each NPC has his own character and how he acts every single one is unique. I love the small details the developer's have put in this game like each hair moving separately on is own really great physics or the alcohol the liquid moving from the glass when a character is moving the glass. Those small details really make the CUT the big impact sadly those details can only be appropriate on PC right now. Soundtracks are really nice and I love the sound effects. Each gun feels and sounds different and is really nice hear every single bullet dropping on the floor it is really nice immersion made from CDPR. Gameplay is fantastic it really is great and I love it! How I said befor each gun feels different sound different and has a different impact while shooting. It is well made and it doesn't feel copy paste like you see for games like CoD or Battlefield. Because CDPR never did a shooter I had fear but they made a great job. You have so many options to fight not only guns but also body modifications what are a huge deal in Cyberpunk 2077. You can have huge blades or a string what cuts everything. The gameplay is really nice it feels like a Doom game I appreciate the hard work and level of detail they put in the gameplay. Leveling up stars is not hard but also not easy it takes some time. Don't rsuh the game you can finish the main story in maybe 15 or 20 hours but I recommend doing side quests in between main quests and also just having fun walking around seeing Night City in his full glory! The city is well designed each detail is nice to see. On PC you can see 30 or 40 people in one street the city feels full of life it really is AWESOME. Now the big elephant in room the BUGS. I honestly will give this game a 10/10 because I love it and I ONLY saw 1 bug so far and it was a small bug BUT... I also saw many PC and console gamers, specially console gamers on base PS4 and Xbox One complaining about bugs. I only saw once a bug on my game and it was the T pose bug where a random NPC made a T pose with his hands. That's it that's the only bug I saw so far and I hope it stays like that.  In the end YES I can understand if those console user scores get low scores because they deserved it. Low FPS, potato PS3 graphics, a lot more bugs... But guys the PC version is really really good yes you need a really good PC to run that game but the game also visually looks like a next gen game. It really is a great trade of. In the end the PC version didn't deserved those user scores but the console version definitely did.… Expand "

Но, хочу отметить, что такие хиты как Скайрим и прочие игры, не делает хуже не длинный сюжет и ошибки. Cyberpunk 2077 игра, про множество побочный миссий, которые интересно выполнять, про приятную прокачку и атмосферу. Проблема и столь низкие оценки в том, что игру сравнивают с Witcher 3, но это не так. В последней игре мы проникались к герою в первую очередь благодаря тому, что знали его историю и то что герой размышлял в слух... Но, было бы странно если бы авторы применили тот же метод в игре, где на улице кучу народа. Да, у нас есть Джони Сильверхенд, но даже так это не будет похоже на разговор героя с самим собой. Игра цепляет не чем-то необычным и инновационым, что ждали все, а просто приятной атмосферой. Лично мне, очень обидно, что из-за каких-то багов и своих же ожиданий, геймеры начали снижать балл и портить оценку такой хорошей игре. Я понимаю, если бы ""атаке нулями"" подверглась какая-то Call of Duty, Asassin creed и тому подобные игры. Потому что в них, авторы правда не вкладывают душу, а просто делают очередную копию, думая что геймеры и так съедят... Но, ставить хорошей компании и хорошей игре минус, за то что разработчики решили очередной раз не переносить игру - это ужасно. Да, CD cd projekt red, могли сделать очередной перенос игры, но тогда бы эффект был абсолютно тот же, а может и хуже. Подумайте, прежде чем ставить минус, а не из-за вашего ли нетерпения игра вышла такой какой есть? Хоть многие теперь были бы рады переносу, но вспомните себя, когда вы узнали о переносе 19 ноября!!! Даже я тогда был зол и в яросте, от этого пробовал найти хоть каплю надежды на то, что игра выйдет раньше. Сейчас, я целыми днями сижу в данной игре и мне не надоедает и нравится всё, а сам я уже не могу дождаться, когда смогу пройти игру по новой за кого-то корпаративника или рёбнка пустошей... Это хорошая игра... Не ставьте ей низкие баллы, просто потому, что это модно и вы чем-то не довольны. Лично по моему мнению, если бы все судили честно, то игра бы заработала 79-82 балла, спокойно. А если ещё и сравнить её ещё с играми от других компаний, то вообще все 95-100... Эта игра с душой, а не те онлайн марионетки или сюжетки, где тебе чётко ставят выбор, между добром и злом. В Cyberpunk 2077, авторы взяли идею из прошлых игр ты не редко выбираешь, между двух зол. А иногда бывают такие моменты, что тебе начинает казаться, что убить человека в этой игре - правильное решение. Ведь, подумайте, по сюжету очередного злодея которого вы решите не убивать или бандита, которого вы просто отправите в отключку, даже не посадят в тюрьму. Вот именно такие спорные эмоции и должны вызывать игры. А что касается багов, я встертил всего 1 крупный и, от силы, 3 мелких. Оптимизация? Не столь плоха.… Expand "

Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is not like anyother (Like a witcher3 ) it's stand proudly on a top of the all. It's a game that was created not to take more money that you had to like games that came before (Assasins creed and other games with microtranzactions), but simply to play it( Dlc in witcher 3 were worth it, you have to admit xd). You didn't have to pay for the new contet or anything this game give you everything you need if you enter the world of Night City. So thank you again for another beautifull game you did a gread job and you should be proud of it. Now i should something about the game right ?) Sorry for my essay... still got the feels from the ending. 1. The graphics- I played on my old 1050 ti, on the lowest settings, on a first day i had many lags and my fps was dying, but with a next patch there were no frezes. I couldn't see all beauty of the game cause i dont have an ccd so npcs sometimes just coulndt render properly, and all i saw were plastic people. I dont mind it btw, i stood a few seconds for them to render and things were good. All i wanted to say its that on the lowest of the settings i could see the sparks of beauty in some moments and even took some great screenshots, so i hope to upgrade my PC to see the full potential of the game. So i guess 6/10? 2. The plot - In my opinion the plot was good, you get to live a life of a mercenary with you path (Nomad, Child from streets, and corporate). The best start i had so far is with Nomads story, the answers in the diologe that you get are just so true sometimes. The characters and their side quests are quite something sometimes you really start to worry for them, cause of their backstrory. In the end of the game you get some strong message ""Dont stop fighting."". And you get a lot of morale choices that helpls you to shape your story. I personally liked, the ideology of Johny Silverhand, he teaches you that your personality and your soul cannot be bought. And that is good to have a real friend at you side a brother if i must say. And the amount of swear words and their quality shows that the game was made for adults. I still cry from the ending btw (20/10) 3 Soundtrack - The soundtrack is gorgeuos from themes of different places to songs from the radio, i still hear the guitar playing from the tower of Silverhand mission and most of the radio songs are now in my playlist. Esspecialy russian voice acting is on another level, i never heard these kinds of swear words in any other game. (The violin in some of the scenes is the best) 20/10 4. Gameplay - Shooting, hacking, stealthing like a ninja you can do everything from ramming your enemies with a car , to slashing them with you cyber blades or a katana. And there are a lot of guns. And dont start about the talking gun. 20/10 Overall the game is great, sry if my english is bad.… Expand "

But as I progressed through the game it was starting to remind me more of a glass, filled with gameplay, graphical and logical bugs and glitches; zombie hands, sun switching on and off, transparency effects glitching out, stealth break through walls (notice meter would not stop), etc. I tried to stay strong, because RPG aspect stayed quite good in first two parts at least, glitches would make nothing but a memes, but then, something made me completely change my mind and made me regret wasting my time with this.  This was the last drop for my patience and I shut down the game.  I looked into relations list...

I think the hype was rightful, because we've got a very nice looking game with a big city. Graphics: I really loved it. It has a very nicely designed city with people and cars. Story/Content: I really loved the story, and the side quests too. The player has a lot of choices in dialogues, a lot of dialogue choices had no consequences, but at least they make the dialogues colourful. Controls/Physics: The controls were comfortable, but the physics were a little bit unrealistic and buggy. Music: The music in the game is really make me feel like a true cyberpunk. Subtitles: It has a lot of language subtitles, not only English, German, Spanish, Japanese etc. It has Czech, Hungarian, Arabic, Polish, Turkish, Italian subtitles, but these languages were translated by real people, not with Google translator. Technical Implementation: Now comes the disadvantage of the game: There are a lot of bugs, with is very annoying, when you can't complete a mission, because of a bug. The optimisation is felt like I'm playing in GTA 4 in PC. I hope they will patch the bugs and making a better optimisation. Re-playability: You can choose from 3 pre-histories, and you can choose from a lot of endings. After that, when I completed the story, I started a new with another prehistory. User Interface: I can easily navigate myself in the settings or in-game. Summary: I think this game is very close for the game of the next year, if they patch the game and adding Multiplayer for the game. My points are around 9,5 which is rounded to 10. I think a lot of people are underrating the game due to bugs, and the horrible Xbox One/ Play Station 4 ports ( I have an Xbox One too. I thought, these ports are not going to be good, and I bought the game for PC.) This game deserves his appreciation.… Expand "

Several videos and reads confirmed what I feared:  The over-hyped CYBERPUNK 2077 was released in 2020 in an unfinished state and garnered outstanding reviews by paid off critics world wide, who didn't play it - there is no way that they could have given it all the 10s out of 10s if they had. More and more came out about the state of this game by CDPR insiders who were shocked that this game was pushed out for release, stating that it wasn't finished and would need at least one more year. This unfinished state was clearly visible through and through: take the wanted system which said employees have stated was not integrated in the game and had to be thrown together to rush it out the door, the result is a system in which cops spawn into the world behind you and shoot instantly. They are incapable of following the player in vehicles (AI in this game is abysmal).  The game is full of features that feel like they were programed 5 minutes before it was rushed out the door, several features that were promised are missing or included in a very basic way. Now, I heard that some patches fix some issues, but I have no desire to returning to this pile of dog p00p. The state in which it was released is an audacity and CDPR lied about it, which makes it even worse.  I also had the feeling the devs ditched the original storyline when Keanu Reeves came on board. Some characters feel like they had a longer storyline originally but got cut down to a sideshow to make room for the main attraction. I like Keanu Reeves, but I really think this game would have been better with the original story.  All in all, even the aspects CYBERPUKE 2077 gets right are not as astounding as critics say either: graphics are good but not mind-blowing even with maxed out ray-tracing. Character models range from OK (main characters) to outright ugly (pedestrians), the open world is sterile and lifeless with NPC AI being braindead as if they were in a zombie game. Compare the graphics you get in the retail version with the 2018 preview you clearly see that CDPR have DOWNGRADED their graphics AGAIN. It looks nowhere near as good. Then driving is just terrible as well. There is zero traction, cars feel like they are made out of paper. It's ridiculous!  And when you turn corners it doesn't feel like a car on wheels turning but rather like a tank.  Well, is it at least immersive? Hell NO! The world is sterile with pedestrians spawning in up the street and fading out down the street - sometimes even as soon as they leave your view. I saw a car  wanted to highjack and I lost it for a split second and there was no tracking it down since it faded out! NPCs don't really ""live"" either, they are glued to a specific spot - day and night.  There is zero life in this game, ZERO. Compare CYBERPUNK 2077 to GTA V/ RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2 and you will see big differences in the game world, the latter being literally alive.  DO NOT buy CYBERPUKE 2077 and buy NECROMUNDA: HIRED GUN instead if you want cyberpunk done right.… Expand "

Remember how Night City was supposed to be smaller, but because of it's verticality the possibilities would be huge? Guess what, there are a handful of towers which have 2 to 3 floors.  Remember that trailer about style, how there are 4 different clothing styles and how these will affect your game, who you are? Your cyberware, your tattoos, the guns? Guess what. There is 0 customization and you can't even get a haircut, tattoo or see the affect of cyber mods on your character.  Remember that trailer about the cars, their style, their purpose? Guess what. None of it really matters because the driving is absolutely insane, cars are completely random and meaningless (why is Night City full of trucks without trailers?).  I can keep going on like that, but none of the promises are real and it's overall a terrible game. Advertised as the most immersive world to date, it lacks basic NPC AI which games like GTA3 and Mafia had (these games are almost 20 years old). Litteraly every open world game in the last 20 years has had traffic AI, NPC's reacting to the player, random things to interact with.. but Cyberpunk doesn't have any of that.

I'm about 20 hours in and I feel like I'm still at the very beginning, taking my time. Night City is stunning and feels, at least at this point very alive. I have a few criticisms but nothing major that is stopping me from enjoying myself.  Combat is faster and dare I say, playing on ""hard"" is actually a little hard. You can't just run-and-gun, you need to use your tools, cyber, skills, find cover, flank, etc. This is making combat a lot more interesting for me instead of just being able mow everything down as often happens in rpg's with ""action"" combat.  Story, writing and aesthetic are full on Pondsmith 80's cyberpunk. If you were expecting a different take on the genre, you are going to be disappointed, perhaps look elsewhere.

Night City feels like an actual place, and wandering the streets in first person feels very immersive at times. What's brining it down? Bugs. I'm lucky, on my copy, for what ever reason, I've only had a few minor bugs and visual glitches. Though my hardware is nowhere near top-end (RTX 1060 and 32gbs of RAM), I've gotten by ok. Your mileage may vary depending on your own setup.  Perhaps most disappointing for me is the lack of good character customization system. The customization screen they give you is about as advanced as something from half a decade ago. Dragon Age, Fallout, hell even Dark Souls gives you more options out of the box for making your player character stand out. Not to mention bodytype editing which feels like it should've been a no-brainer. Fortunately (or unfortunately) most of the action takes place in first person. Also confusingly, they also leave out any option of going back in and editing your appearance. One can only hope this comes out with some free DLC, as has been the case with other RPGs making the same mistake  Speaking of action, the combat is fairly decent. Guns feel impactful, but sometimes enemies at higher difficulties can feel a little bullet spongy. Solid RPG mechanics make a variety of builds and paths available and I can already see myself creating new characters down the line. I also found a decent amount of branching paths and options playing through the main quest and sidequests so far (~20 hrs in), certainly better than your average Bethesda game, but maybe not quite at the level people expected.  There is a very solid RPG here, depending on your tolerance--and luck--when it comes to the bugs. HOWEVER it should be noted that that's as much as you get. There's nothing wildly new here, outside of some fun game mechanics and a pretty backdrop. Is it fun? Yes. Can it be engaging? very much so. But is it Next-gen?

Anyhow after many hours I finished all the side quests and the main story, now I'm back after the ending exploring every section the city bit by bit.

Yes there are bugs but I've never ran into anything game breaking or a simple reload could not fix.  The Main story and Character arcs had a level of polish that doesn't exist for the side missions and random encounters.  Initially I felt the gun play really clunky but as I leveled up and invested skill points into gun handling it all turned around, fights became satisfying and very responsive.  Even more so after applying mods to reduce recoil etc.  Some enemies are bullet sponges but you have to realise this is an RPG game, if mobs feel too difficult it's because you haven't leveled up enough. AI definitely requires tuning.  During fire fights many of them would just stand behind cover and let you pick them off one by one.  And yes you can obtain weapons with bullet penetration making it even easier.  I would have preferred if the game had more emphasis on the various corporations in NC and have a reputation system that unlocks missions/gear while becoming hostile with others.  It's the perfect setting for this mechanic since the whole back story is corps gaining power while screwing over others.  Graphics wise this is the best I've seen where various materials look very realistic.  My 2080TI with RTX on might have something to do with that; while averaging 70fps on Ultra.  Characters is where this game excels.  The voice acting, directing and character story arcs is simply the most well made I've seen in a video game.

The map is large, graphics is good, soundtrack is nice, there's a lot of writing and voice overs. It's clear that an army of decent artists worked on that. On the ""actual game"" side it's completely different story:  Combat is very basic, there are basically four enemies and one bullet sponge variant. Enemies give up fighting you after you crouch behind cover few times. Whole aming, dodgning and melee reminds me of bad Maken X clone. That game was released in 1999.  There is no AI in this game. Opponents just shoot, move a bit, and get confused as **** when you crouch behind a crate.  Sneaking is bad. Enemies freeze in place and repeat constantly two sentences when alerted. At one time they will see you while you're behind them, at other they won't notice you in front of them. Robots cannot be taken down so you're left with loud option. Just like Deus Ex, some bosses just must be fought so full stealth build is not an option.  Driving has an input delay and feels unresponsive.  Dialog system promises you freedom of choice but all you can choose are mostly some minor things that play out almost immediately. Some choices do not affect the course of play at all.  Main story is super boring and badly written. 90% of the time you listen to poor dialogs and very weak exposition. Pretty much nothing is shown and everything is told. Even Keanu sounds bored and ashamed to be in it. It's a spit in the face of original Pondsmith material.  Side quests are a bit better because there's some gameplay in them even though every side piece of content is basically fetch an item or slap a baddie.  There are like three braindances which are basically short point and click minigames and only in main story.  Even if they fix technical issues it's still objectively one of the worst games. Game's high budget and good graphics are like a Jedi mind trick, work only on the weak minded. Everything is bugged, everything is glitching. If it's in the game there's something wrong with it. And if someone's giving it more than 5/10 there's something wrong with him/her/them.  Another pretty but shallow game courtesy of people who give high scores. That's why we can't have nice things.

People will always find things to bring a game down and that is their opinion just as this review is my opinion. I believe that this game was hyped so much it was never going to reach the goals people hyped it to be, I kept my expectations about how I expected the Witcher series and I was not disappointed.  Things I love about the game Story: Very good story, reminds me of Shadowrun on SNES. Graphics: On a RTX2070 I have had no issues since the patch and driver update. Environment: As a long time, Cyberpunk TTRPG GM and player I loved every minute of it, looking from the outside you see a small city, but once you are in it it’s huge and packed. Side quests: These are hit and miss but mostly enjoyable and punish you if you are not ready for them. Characters: All the main characters V interacts with I love, some of the side ones are one note but they should be. Also, Judy is best girl! Cyberware: feels they did not dig into the lore of cyberpunk as much as I wish they did. Character options:   I love some of the options but some I am confused on; I wish I could see my character more often besides the mirror and one the motorcycle. The customization is good but could be better. Things that need work and I have issues with Bugs: There are still bugs after the patch, but I run into very few now, also update your graphics driver. Driving: I have to say I do no enjoy driving in this game, easiest way is using a motorcycle as you see more of the road and are more maneuverable. The driving needs to be tighter not so floaty. I wish there was an auto drive to just sit and move the camera while the car/bike drove by itself to the destination. Character options:   I love some of the options but some I am confused on; I wish I could see my character more often besides the mirror and one the motorcycle. The customization is good but could be better. Audio glitches: This by no means takes me out of the game but sometimes people say stuff and the mouths do not move, OR you do not hear anything, and you know something was supposed to be said. User Interface: At times is laggy and feels inconvenient to use at times  Final thoughts Can I recommend this game to buy YES, it is a very good game Many negative reviews and even some of the positive either over critique it or ignore the bugs they see. It needs improvement through patches, but in general I think the game is in a good state just needs tweaking, I know people may not have the PC I have BUT it could be better optimized in general. BUT out of the box the game runs and runs well, YES there are issues which I am sure will be addressed. Is it worth it’s price yes, but if you waited till they fixed some of the bugs I would not blame you, for me I have played 30+ hours and am not even done with the main story and loving the game.

CyberPunk is clearly last year's good game, not revolutionary, nor particularly innovative.  I am quite disappointed with the way CDRP conducted this project until its release. I like many naively thought that the studio was confident in its realization; these last days have for my part blown the fuse of confidence with them. They are not entirely at fault in this case (over-hype of the media, immense expectations of the players), but they keep a significant part by the silence knowing the result they will deliver. I sincerely hope that CDRP will learn the lessons of this episode and do what is necessary not to plunge further into the dark side of current game publishers.  However Cyberpunk, is good! really fun to play, I don't have enough hours yet to judge the narration but the game is very immersive (thanks for the localization of the audio), the graphics are very good and on my pc (i7 , 1080,32rm) it runs very well and still smooth. I still haven't experienced any blocking bugs.  The gameplay in general is quite heavy to take in hand, but when you deepen the skills and the crafting you really feel like you become a real threat to your enemies. On the other hand, ergonomics and inventory management are a real mess, I have the impression of having become Geralt de Riv again: Kill, loot, sell, repeat.  Despite the very good experience that this game gives me and the credibility of its universe, I have a hard time ignoring the lack of interaction, life and atmosphere of the map: The NPCs are empty of interest, little diversified; The stores are very basic and not very widespread. But it's mostly the lack of interaction and attention to detail that often gets me out of the game, not being able to sit at a counter, grab and move objects, no public transport, etc. Sometimes you feel like a ghost in this city.  To conclude I rate it at 8/10, because I had saved myself from expectations and I must admit that I love this kind of gameplay and universe. I am captivated by the story and the game works great for me. In short, this game does not disappoint me! And I totally understand why a lot of other people are.

There's no way this game is even an 8. The bugs are just a surface level distraction from how empty and soulless this game actually is.  Compared to the way they marketed the open world of Cyberpunk, the end result is a empty husk with no substance. They've put make up on a pig and ""professional"" reviewers eat it up for god knows what reason. This game lacks very basic features that you need for an open world game. I'm talking bare minimum stuff. One example of this is the lack of an actual AI for traffic. This game has no actual traffic Ai built into it. The drivers in this game are bots with predestined routes, no actual behaviour built into them. They drive from point A to point B and when you obstruct traffic they stop functioning and wait for you to remove said obstruction. There's no honking or switching lanes, things you'd expect from real life traffic. Things that are implemented in other open world games. GTA has had this since it's 4th installment, probably even earlier.  The way the player interacts with the police is another obvious tell of how empty this game is. There's no chase. You commit a crime and suddenly a cop teleports behind you and kills you. Again, similair games with open world structure that also have police in them have had believably interactions with police 2 generations ago. Why would a 2020 game made by one of the most respected developers not have this? There's absolutely nothing to do in this so called open world, the game would function better on rails in its current state.  Putting the lack of very basic and bare minimum AI aside, this game lacks customizability which should be a red flag considering the setting. This should be a massive opportunity for players to express themselves, but instead you get an overwhelming character creation with no means of adjusting your appearance later into the game. There are doctors that will implant you with cybertech but good luck getting a trim, cause the technology for that hasn't hit Cyberpunk yet.  What a failure of a game.

For starters I'm running this on high/ultra on a 2070 Super, Ryzen 3700X, 32GB RAM, Auorus SSD, RTX on, DLSS on auto. Sooooo a rather decent rig I would say...not god tier but not bad either. Maybe that is the major issue, the game is NOT optimized at all. Some slower systems might and possibly WILL not manage and due to some strange driver issue it seems that 30XX Nvidia GPUs have some serious problems as of now (might have changed by the time you're reading this). I don't know why CDPR thought it would be a good idea to promote a 1060 GTX as the recommended GPU or why they thought as PS4 (without the pro) would be able to handle this, but I guess there are stock market rules that I don't understand and that force developers to make annoucements and promisses, they know they can't uphold.  So performance wise it runs smooth as hell, for the most part on my system. Sometimes FPS drops down to 20-30 but gets back to nearly 60 after 5 minutes or so. So I guess it might be more of an CPU issue when there's much to load up.  Storywise...it's good. Really good. If you liked the Witcher games, you'll love this. It's mature, full of solid writing and difficult themes. This might be a problem for younger gamers tho. Woah, hear me out on this! Some of us who grew up with Shadowrun, Blade Runner and stuff like that just ""feel"" this world in a different kind of way. There's a connection to the worldbuilding, the NPCs and the quests. It's difficult to explain but trust me there's some nice stuff in there, that just get's you when you're the right kind of person. If however you don't get any of the themes here, you might just as well skip the game. It opens up to you if you're into the whole Cyberpunk theme but if you're not I can see why the overall theme might just as well be another open world shooter/RPG with no real depth to it.  On the gameplay side, it's complicated. It has it's flaws with being overly compicated, having clunky menus and far too much customization options (that you probably won't use), but on the other hand, if you're willing to take your time and take it slow, there's soooo much to do. Yeah you can rush trough the main story in about 25 hours. But where's the fun in that? You can put 100somewhat hours into it with side quests, activities and lore in ONE playtrought! There are several different endings and options, depending on your ""origins"" (you can choose one of three), so replayability is there. Stealth, guns blazing or a mix in between, every ""quest"" (gig) can be solved in many different ways, so yeah it's all there.  After 7-9 years of developement this game is not yet finished. But it's pretty close to being and it's a rollercoaster worth getting on a couple times...if you have the hardware to actually get things done here.… Expand "

GodofNeckbeards,"Dec 13, 2020",8,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I HAVE BEATEN THE GAME AND I AM IRRITATED AS HELL (but not for reasons you would think). I am clocking in at 50 hours for the game and am ready to write my review (almost going to be my first for this website so yay me).  The game dynamics are really nice. First is combat: The gunplay in this game is really nice. I wish that they'd increase the fire rate for enemies so that if you let yourself get caught out of cover it's a bit more punishing, but the different weapon classes and individual weapons in each class keep themselves diverse enough that you have many different options that are all satisfying in different ways. For example, I love being able to whip out my legendary explosive ""Grad"" and rocking someone's chicklets into the back of their mouth with a high-velocity incendiary round, just to immediately turn around and yank a sneaky NPC's legs out from under them with a rail-accelerated shotgun, then execute the now renamed Stumpy with my handgun that is protected by the Second Amendment while simultaneously violating the Geneva Convention. Speaking of, the cyberware. It's broken. Monowire is clunky but powerful enough to just sweep groups of enemies like dust-bunnies into a trash bin, the mantis blades' favorite passtime is the metaphorical raping of anything carrying a discernible pulse, the gorilla fists bring a whole new meaning to ""fingerblasting"", and the arm-mounted artillery cannon offers enough firepower to make almost any ranged weapon obsolete. The first three make carrying melee weapons pointless in terms of stats. The only reason you would actually use a melee weapon when you have monowire or mantis blades is just to use something different, for variety, but stat-wise you're almost assuredly losing DPS. The AI is a bit questionable. Melee AI is actually great and I think CDPR did a real good job of letting melee enemies not allow you to cheese by dodging super early or just stay out of range, but some things are iffy. Like certain enemies being able to melee you while you're double-jumped inot the air way out of reach. If you're fighting a particularly strong enemy, typically the bosses or cyberpsychos, the name of the game is **** them from a roof"". Once you're on a roof or just somewhere higher than the enemy with even the slightest bit of cover, then you've won. There's virtually no way for the enemy to fight you. Self-preservation of enemies is pretty good though and it makes it so that you actually have to be tactical enough to avoid getting destroyed at higher levels. Second: Side Quests and Open World The side quests are nice extra little tidbits of story that often happen outside of your main story, but that doesn't mean some won't affect it. When you get certain side quests from certain NPCs (you should know which ones) they can affect your main story, primarily the ending. When you wanna take a break from seeing how bleak your outlook is with Johnny involuntarily skull-****ing you to death with his 1s and 0s 18-inch destroyer, the side quests and gigs are nice. They're a big boost to loot, xp, street cred, and money. Something you need often. As for the open world, crowds are a nice addition that were executed well, outside of large chunks sometimes disappearing when you look away from them. The occasional funny T-pose is acceptable since the game has to calculate what each NPC is doing and where they're going all at once in these crowds, so some AIs just stop working. The little blue objectives (gangs, assault, evidence) are also large boosts to your stats and really help you keep your money up in later game. They are both a boon and a curse as they provide arguable most of your resources, but grinding them too long also makes them very painful after a while and can take you away from the story and thrills for too long if you're having to grind for cash. Finally: The Story And acting The story wasn't as enthralling as I thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, it's a good story, great even when you think about what it really is and represents, especially at certain key points where you REALLY need to think about the decisions you're making, but it was really short and some moments did take a bit longer to do than they needed to. Some characters were also just absolutely forgettable and didn't need to be there, like Brigitte and The Animals. Literally two quests with them and then they didn't matter. But at other moments, when you're connecting more with Johnny and you start to just spill to each other, or when you're at the final decision and you have to figure out what you want to do about your lives, the game really shines and absolutely just rips me in. Overall, the game is really good, despite some of its bugs that were comical at their best and slightly inconveniencing at their worst. I give the game an 8.5 out of 10, which almost hurts me to say as I had extremely high hopes for the studio and the game, especially since I gave Ghost of Tsushima a 9… Expand "
novaecl1pse,"Dec 13, 2020",9," Great game so far! I just beat the game as a Street Kid with 50hrs of gameplay.. (Didn't do a whole lot of side quests the first time). My only issue with the game is that it's called CyberPUNK. PUNK. And the number of times they try to force us to help the police in the game, is a bit ridiculous. Helping the cops is NOT PUNK. At All. Punks HATE COPS.   I'm running a GTX1060 6GB withGreat game so far! I just beat the game as a Street Kid with 50hrs of gameplay.. (Didn't do a whole lot of side quests the first time).

At All. Punks HATE COPS.  I'm running a GTX1060 6GB with 32Gigs RAM, an i7 7700k CPU, with the game installed on an SSD. It runs GREAT on Low settings for me during any activity. I can run it on High as well with only minor choppiness during driving, no choppiness when not driving, so I switch between settings, low for driving, high when not.  Bugs and glitches should be expected when a game is launched, especially one of this magnitude.. that being said I have encountered tons of minor bugs, but nothing game breaking, and no game crashes.… Expand "
ZonaV,"Dec 13, 2020",9," A lot of bugs, but very integesting main story. Very big world and a lot of others quests "
whydowedothis,"Dec 13, 2020",9, This game is great on a system that can run it. The world feels amazing even with subpar AI routines. I feel bad for people that can't run the game properly because it's beautiful. I don't think someone that can't even play the game should be allowed to review it but that's just me. 
Mongooseeyy,"Dec 13, 2020",8," Playing on XSX, the game is great. The bugs are not intolerable, the graphics are not as good as I hoped, but with tweaking TV and HDR settings, it does look acceptable. The meat of the game, the story and gameplay, is phenomena though! "
kainegd,"Dec 13, 2020",0, All style no substance. Plays like a farcry game. Just super average with a nice coat of paint but people are delusional thinking patches will make this the game CDPR advertised. Very disappointing even when it is 100% fixed.
