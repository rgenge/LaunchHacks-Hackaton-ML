Crashes Randomly  One of the worst Need for Speed games ever made. I literally made this Metacritic account because the game is so poorly made and hope to deter people from buying it.  Tuning is awful and not representative at all of what you've changed.  Cars will go from turning right lightly to 90 degree turns randomly. Initiating drifts is neither realistic or consistent.  You have to buy cheap cars to complete most drift races because you have to group drift with ai that has terrible vehicles vs the most minutely upgraded car instead of scaling to your car.  No option to save custom tuning preferences. Doing one player quest line requires you to tune back and forth between set ups constantly. I just bought 2 of the same car to tune them for each race type. Then a low level car to do other characters missions because I would blow by packs and not be capable of scoring drift points.  Cops don't do much at all. Might as well be Midtown Madness 2.  Not sure how anyone could give this game a rating higher than a 6 unless they were paid to.… Expand "

Without manual transmission as an option the game was the very opposite of what it set out to be.  The game is very beautiful, it's one of the best looking driving games I've seen. The handling, as expected, is very arcade with little distinction between the cars. The customisation is good fun and you can spend hours in that garage messing around with spoilers and paint and decals. I've thoroughly enjoyed the game and I knew what I was getting, an arcade racer, which is what it is. I don't have a high spec pc and it runs beautifully with only one crash so far.  Why the low score? Always online. A ridiculous function that EA has been pursuing for years on their games and regardless of all the negative feedback on it they still stubbornly try to push it on games. Then try to justify it by letting a bunch of player drive around in the same city to make it feel more lively, but all that ends up happening is you have a bunch of people who will ram into each other and generally spoil the experience. But, this, still isn't the main bad thing. The always online function absolutely CRIPPLES the game experience. If you lose connection for a second, you're out. Sometimes your wraps and paints that get automatically saved to the cloud (why?) won't load at all.  In the end we all know what always online means: It means that a few years down the line you're going to sit with a game in your Origin library that cannot be played because the servers have been closed. So essentially you're not buying a game, you're renting it for a limited amount of years.… Expand "
SpyderSeven,"Mar 24, 2016",6," Always online. Nothing quite like latency in a single player race. Customization options are slim. None of the first 4 cars I bought had parts available for every option, and many of the options have only a single part. You can't remove stock spoilers, what?

Customization options are slim. None of the first 4 cars I bought had parts available for every option, and many of the options have only a single part. You can't remove stock spoilers, what? Besides that, almost every aftermarket spoiler in the game is a hilarious bosozoku park bench. The only good spoiler I found was the cool ducktail on the Volvo.  The vinyl editor is better than old NFS games, but still rotten. Still no tools to line up your decals. Just a pair of racing stripes is stupid hard to get, and you STILL have to make separate stripes for the top and both bumpers. The interface is hair-pullingly frustrating.  Wow, I can tune my car to handle like a real one with the Grip setting? Doesn't matter, because more than half of this game involves drifting and it's absurdly difficult to drift a Grip car. Besides, who would want to race a car that has to use the brakes against cars that can whip into any corner at any speed by dumping momentum into a drift?  Manual shifting is junk. Double-tap the shifter to drop 2 gears, and you will drop one. Every shift forces you to clutch, shift, and declutch through each individual gear, including if you crash and need to reverse. It will take you at least a good 5 seconds to change from 6 to R. Also, you need to choose manual trans for every single car you buy. For some reason transmission is a tuning option instead of a user preference. I can't believe how much time I spent looking for it in the options menu.  Rubberbanding. Ugghhh, your skills still don't matter in an AI race. The AI will accelerate with Gs that would puree a human being if they think you're not looking. There is no way to gain a sizeable lead. The AI will stick to you like a burdock to a wool hat no matter how delicately you thread the corners, but a crash in some races will leave you fighting for 3rd place while the first two cars inexplicably rocket miles ahead of the pack.  Career progression is dumb. Finish a mission, and you'll just have to drive around until you get a call from your buddies. Besides that, there is no story to the missions. Race here, drift this, hit this speed. All of that is in the context of some bizarre PUSH YOURSELF mantra kind of like the one in Rivals, and there is no visible progression until the end of the campaign. My ""bae"" also made fun of me over the ridiculous and plotless cutscenes. She was probably just jelly. Fist bump? Oh, and Manu's hair. What?  Yes, it's always night time and usually raining. Looks good, but it gets pretty stale. The city is nice and it looks pretty good, but there are few real landmarks and appreciable vistas. In Rivals you'd turn a corner to see an incredible mountain range over the railing or a desert stretching to the peaks in the distance, but Ventura Bay is just a bunch of roads. The roads are laid out in a frustrating way. Highway dividers are placed in homicidal and nonsensical places. There can't be more than 5 traffic cars in the whole city, but they are always waiting in the racing line just around a corner. The road fatalities in Ventura Bay must be extreme.  The multiplayer is half-baked. Just like Rivals, you'll spend 5 minutes chasing someone and hoping for a race only to find that they've been racing AI the whole time and can't engage you. This game is advertised as being a combination of single and multiplayer, but it's really just single with a little crappy multiplayer baked in, and the two are in constant conflict. I hated the Speed Tests and Challenges in MW'12, but at least I could just jump into a multiplayer game then.  The cars are fun to drive, and they look great. The sound from the Viper is freaking phenomenal, and most of the other cars are no exception. Learning to thread the line is very satisfying in a gripped-up car. If only there were more opportunities to do that.  All in all, it's a decent game. It took a few of the good parts from the old games, all of the flaws, and added a few new headaches like always online to boot. The first few hours were a lot of fun but, in true EA fashion, the crap comes out of the woodwork as you play. I found myself more disappointed than thrilled. There was never a moment that I got caught up in the game - there is always some detail waiting to break the immersion. Really glad I paid the $5 for the All Access trial, because this game is worth closer to $30 for me than 60, or even worse 70 for the package that spoils the game by putting every 3rd driver in the Most Wanted BMW. (also, do you remember when demos were free? I do)… Expand "

The visual part of the game is a ten out of ten. the Frostbite engine is pretty as always. Of course there are some effects i could live without, but my eyes easily get used to them. The handling is ok, nothing outstanding like TDU2 or the Forza Horizon series. It needs time to learn it properly, but it's really not a challenge. Maybe drifting is a bit hard, i tried to avoid it as mush as i could, because i was very suck at it. The car selection is ok, but i think supercars like the Ferrari or Lamborghini has nothing to do in this game. It's about street racing. The customization is really gives the player much freedom, i was satisfied with it (i mean the amount as i could see) The city is well builded, the always raining anomaly didn't annoyed me as so many others. Do you remember Underground 2? Just play an hour with it, you'll see how often raining in that game too. But there are some issues with this game which are still refuse me to give a god damn euro to this game. Fist thing first, the non-stop online connection requirement is nothing but a backward to this game. YOu ALWAYS need to be connected to the internet, and it just only make things worse if you have a kinda slow connection. It not going to screw up your races or anything, but you will experience performance problems and lagging even in a SINGLE PLAYER RACE! You also cannot bring up the world map or the menu properly, the game will still run in the background. How am i suppose to scrape my head in the middle of the race? Of course you can go solo which means you don't have to share your map with random people who park in the very same racing spot where you just want to teleport, or place a marker. But it still requires internet connection of course... the AI is as braindead as it can be. I don't know how it was when the game got released on consoles... i heard people complaining about the horrible catch-up system, maybe it was fixed or spoiled, because for me it was almost impossible to get beaten, even if i screwed up a corner or missed a checkpoint. In the very few times when they somehow managed to overtake me, they just randomly crashed into the wall, without reason. And it not happened just one or two times... no. At least in every second or third race. Very depressing. I still wouldn't buy it even if it had a 90% OFF sale, because the online... just call it DRM; ruins the fun for me. Let me decide whenever i want to cruise with other players or not, don't force your **** on me. But it has the potential. Maybe if they would listen a bit more to the player feedbacks and rethink the game design, it could be an ok Need for Speed game. Until then, it's nothing just a kinda medium strenght shot.… Expand "

Cars are undriveable. Even if cars become better with progression (not sure thats the case) driving is such a painfull and annoying experience because the cars seem to be having a mind of their own. Tuning helps a little, but not in any significant way.  I wanted to play the game even so. But what made make this MC account were the little things that really pushed the button. Firstly its the controls. Its become intuitive to press ESC to reach a menu. Not in NFS 2016. To reach the menu you have to press Backspace. Sure... you can change that right? Nope. Cant change it... Sure there are a bunch of annoying tips jumping in your face but they never explain how to reach the phone menu which even tough you went through all your messages seems to constantly show that you have new messages.  Let me also mention the developers endeavour to cause epileptic attacks. Each time you encounter police you will be stunned with bright flashes of light which will make you look away after experiencing searing pain in your eyes. The game is dark, flashes are bright white, red and blue.  After all this wrestling with my car, my keyboard and the visuals I've managed to get to the starting point of a race. I drive up, want to start the race, press several keys I now know to be related to executing actions in this witty installment and all I get is a message all over the screen in bright red: ""Turn your car to start the race"". Turn your car around? Seriuosly??? Even though starting a race is followed by a loading screen and you dont really start at the same spot you've entered the event?

I played with the XBox controller so i do not know how it plays with keyboard or wheel, but controller was horrible. You can change handling of your car with the tune-able parts to drift focused or grip focus. Drift focus mean that it will be near impossible to drive straight while grip means you will have turning circle of a supertanker a middle road means that you will start drifting but next second you are driving dead straight into the wall. Anyway handling is absurd is what i meant to say. Next on the list AI and difficulty. There are races with three difficulties easy medium and hard. Depending on the race it is more like extremely easy somewhat easy and almost challenging. AI cars are super dumb and thanks to the fact that races take place in the open world you will often smash into AI racers that are just driving around getting in way. Also other human players can come over and ruin you races with no consequence to themselves so that is fun too. Cops in this game are utterly pointless they never catch anyone all they do is annoy you with sirens flashing lights and when you will inevitably escape you will get blinding blue flash to let you know. Also getting chased by cops prevents from restarting events. On the point of restarting races if you do restart you will be teleported to the event starting place and will have to watch loading screen and unskippable race intro again. And a 1000 more minor annoyances like interface some controls are remapable some not etc all add up to make game with great potential into frustrating mess.

Who talks like that in the real world ? EA and Ghost had a good idea but simply didn't follow through with their promises. Why do I have 5 million options to make my car look good if it handles the same way anyways with a simple ""OVERALL"" Slider bar for ""DRIFT"" or ""GRIP"" ... sad. After finishing the story I am left with a world that only contains ""already played"" events to make more money and useless REP points. I reached REP Level 52 and basically everything was unlocked for the few cars I was offered to purchase. 97% percent of game completion after 14 hours in game time don't justify a 72$ price tag. 30 spots to find to take a picture and 30 spots to find to do a stupid DONUT is the tip of the melting Iceberg. Obvious hiding spots and non existing shortcuts including Police AI that seems never be able to catch up with you make this game totally worthless. I can't even pause the game while in a race to take a leak or answer a Phone call. On top of that fake social network tweets and idiotic cell phone calls ingame that stop the second you passed the story make this game one of the worst NEED FOR SPEED titles in its entire franchise history.  Sorry EA and GHOST .. you didn't convince me and I returned the game successfully to buy my Kids and my wife a visit to the 3D movies tonight.… Expand "

I bought this hoping to actually have the customization options that they advertised. I prefer grip style racing but, unfortunately, at least half of the races in the game are drift point races... which aren't actually races at all, it's just point stacking. Drifting is a very frustrating experience in the game too because other players are always online with you and will randomly crash into you, ruining a good turn here or a good drift there. You really don't have a choice, if you don't want to play drift style, this game really isn't for you. I wanted to like it, I really did. I got toward the end of the game and the RNG from the computers are completely stacked against you. One computer got a 40,000 point drift at the beginning of the race and no could catch up after that, and it seems to happen more often than not.  Pros:  -4k looks pretty good. Most noticeably on with the weather elements in the game. -There really is a lot of visual customization you can do.  Cons: -Online style like GTA5 is a good idea in theory, but when the other players will ruin your races it loses its appeal quickly. -RNG is the most random numbers generated of any game I have ever seen. Sometimes it is just pure luck. -The lines on the mini-map displaying your track are sometimes off and can lead you to a wrong part of the race, making you turn around. -You have to drift. Some races you can play grip style but for many you have to learn how to drift. A few forced drift races are okay but when most of the game is comprised of drifting, it takes away the element of choice. -RNG is against you with crashes and glitches too. ---Sometimes the smallest touch on a wall will flip you over with a crash scene ---Cops have literally glitched into my track on multiple occasions. Randomly popping up in the middle of the track and either glitched in place or what seems like server lag as a car will instantly move from one spot to another. -There aren't really a lot of cars to choose from compared to other NFS games. And some cars you can't even do any type of tuning.  Conclusion: If you're a drifter, you'll probably enjoy this game but you'll still be frustrated with the RNG this game delivers. There's nothing worse than being in the lead at the end of the race and then another player zooms by and smashes you, ending your lead at the final stretch. Don't pay full price if you want to try it, wait for a sale. You'll punch yourself in the face if you pay top dollar for this game. The 4k is nice, but the game itself has a lot to be desired.… Expand "

Using EA's Frostbite engine, Ghost has made a photorealistic game that truly makes you feel like you're street racing in the heart of a living city. WIth incredible lighting and mediocre weather (just rain), this game shines in the graphics department.  -Gameplay- NFS is all about driving, and NFS15 gets it right. In terms of car control, you can customize many aspects to suit your driving and visual styles, as customization options are aplenty. The inclusion of support for steering wheels is a plus, but take note that Sony's Dualshock 4 controllers do have issues with this game (Xbox controllers only). The best aspect of this game's gameplay is hands-down the incredible seamless experience it delivers. From checking the map to entering and exiting cutscenes, everything is done in a beautifully polished way that makes the entire game seem like a non-stop sequence. The only loading you'll ever see is during the start-up - after that, you can cruise, crash and drift everywhere smoothly (even in multiplayer, given you've got a good internet connection of course).  -Audio- NFS can't really be commended for audio, as it's just 3rd-party songs and your standard automobile noises. But, the tracklist is quite nice.  -Story- NFS games in the past have had stories, but most of us don't buy them for the tales they tell. With that said, NFS15 doesn't have a solid story on its hands - instead, there are a lot of small cutscenes here and there that provide a nice little break from nearly crashing into everyone as you attempt to catch that perfect drift. They lack a lot of story, and the game is primarily about trying to get noticed in the automotive scene, which itself isn't enough for a ""story"" to ride on.  -Issues- As everyone's most probably talked about, the game requires an active internet connection to play. This is a terrible design by Ghost, as people may want to play offline due to internet-related issues or performance issues. It also doesn't help that most of the NFS community is doing something else, leaving you with a (pretty much) defunct multiplayer. Additionally, I did find fault that Ghost only allowed people to race from dusk to dawn - this does help the environment looks snappier, but can get quite tedious not being able to play with a ""real"" day/night cycle. Other than this glaring problem, I couldn't find anything else wrong with the game.  -Verdict- NFS15 is a fun game and is worth a buy if you're looking to spend a good 20+ hours racing around a photorealistic environment with hosts of amazing cars and various customization options. True, the game does have many issues, but I feel that the online-only restriction is an option that shut out prospective buyers due to its ""DRM"" nature (and performance inhibitor) and should ward off buyers who value DRM-free games.… Expand "

The visuals look almost realistic with the car models, cop chases are more reasonable, and customization is back in a big way. The game is well optimized for frame rate gpus such as my 6GB RAM, GTX 770 but falling through the ground is a problem.  The game uses FMV (Full Motion Video) for the Cutscenes even though they are corny but they were never meant to be serious. You can sometimes understand what there intentions are. The FMV Cutscenes are also meant to be for mission expansion.  A.I. rubber banding is indeed involved with the game. The A.I. cars meant to keep up at your speed so if you want to play with a crappy Volvo, you may possibly win a race.  Missions are straight forward. Sprints, Circuits, Time Trials, Drift Trials, Drift Races, Gymkhanas.  The game is online only and I am somewhat disappointed since sometimes my internet just can't handle it sometimes.  Eddie is in the game as well and you can earn his car for free if you beat him. Manual transmission is back and even though I dont use it, I'm pretty sure would love to use it.  Customization is outstanding. You can customize the front bumpers, back bumpers, body kits, side skirts, rims, tire treads, exhaust tips, bonnet hoods, splitters, trunk lids, diffusers, front fenders, back fenders, headlights, backlights, window tint, color, vinyls, preset wraps, and soon to come ""neon lights"". Customization is the most realistic kind, only with aftermarket brands. Some cars have lots of customization, some have little, and a little have not at all. There are 53 cars in the game but the objective of the cars is perfecting not collecting. The cars also are built inside the game. Your customized car can be in the cutscene.  The career is split into 5 ways to play. Speed, Style, Build, Crew, Outlaw. The main elements in Need For Speed. With real life icons and actors who look up to these people.  Police chases are not as aggressive as what was in NFS Rivals but more fairer, less buggy and more playable. Roadblocks, spike strips, and the actual cruisers feel more realistic and fun. Some roadblock slow you down but you still pass them, while roadblocks made with cement blocks and rhino units are impossible to pass unless you find an extra road. The pursuit levels come into 5 levels. You can simply pay a fine and get the pursuit over with but that's not as fun. You need to pester them enough in order to get on with the pursuit. While starting in a pursuit, you are chased by 1 cop, but overtime you will be chased by a few more. The largest amount I've seen was 7 and trust me cops aren't as easy to get ride of at a decently customized ride. Unlike other games where is easy to destroy some low level cars, trying to do that is almost impossible. Just don't try to take 'em out you may get busted.

I can´t believe it, and because that, my game expierence wasn´t perfect. Other things like small glitches, the difficulty (it´s so easy) and the always-online choice were also bad.  If you are a really NFS fan, and you find this game under $15, just buy it, enjoy  the history mode, the Eddie´s Challenge, and that´s all.  Sorry for bad english :P… Expand "

Sure always online is a pain in the butt but now a days with solid ISP this shouldn't be an issue. The best part about this game is that (IMO) you start out with Older lower tier cars and have to work your self up to the nicer cars. I love this aspect of the game. The progression, the leveling up and going from an old 2000 Honda to something nicer.  The graphics looks great big step up from Most Wanted as well. Honestly just skip Most Wanted and skip straight to this game. Its a great NFS game and a must have for NFS fans. Best NFS in a while. Worth the $5 I paid in Origin Access. Love it.

slick_trick,"Apr 22, 2018",5," Gameplay is alright but intentional design choices lead to it taking a really long time to actually play.  With a top end computer you should expect to be playing your game within a minute after you start it.   Here you are *literally* looking at a about almost 10 minutes before you are driving from after you start the game.. and that is after every single start.    Game starts withGameplay is alright but intentional design choices lead to it taking a really long time to actually play.  With a top end computer you should expect to be playing your game within a minute after you start it.   Here you are *literally* looking at a about almost 10 minutes before you are driving from after you start the game.. and that is after every single start.    Game starts with ""loading EA Servers"" load screen while you get to hear some garbage rap music.   This one isn't so bad and takes only about 15 seconds maybe till the initial menu comes up.   Then you start the game from there which loads your garage.   Loading your 'garage' which at the time I write this only has 1 car in it takes a whopping 3-4 minutes.   You will sit there with your jaw on the floor wondering what in the name of God would be taking so long.   This is everytime you start the game whether you have one car in your garage or 5.    There is obviously some tomfoolery going on here as I see no reason whatsover that this can take 1/10th the amount of time this load screen  takes.   After about literally 2-3 minutes at the least you then immediately hit escape to exit the garage which at that point it then hits y ou with another 1-2 minute load screen while it ""finds people for you to play with"" which by the way chugs up the game and causes microstuttering which in  driving game is a big issue and lessens the enjoyment considerably.  There are game options to play alone but lo and behold .. and whoever thought of this one one really has to wonder... that option is not listed *until* after you are already in a game.   Then and only after you have survived the literal 5-7 minutes of loading screens can you then go the menu and select ""Play Alone"" at which point the game has the nerve to AGAIN reload the whole world, taking yet ANOTHER 1-2 minutes of loading screen.   Forget reading this and looking at these numbers, a person really has to sit and imagine wanting to play a game and having to sit there for almost TEN MINUTES before you are actually playing the game.   And the gameplay itself is not all that great.  Its ok.. the nightime city is nice looking thats about it.  The driving has been done better many times.    The vast majority of the people who have bought this game are going to probably force themselves to play a few times and then tell themselves its just not worth how long it takes.   Also on many machines you will find yourself constantly falling off the world and leading to a new load screen which will screw up your progress in any race you might be in.   The race will continue on while your subjected to another 1-2 minute load screen (usually like 30 seconds once your in the game.. but the race is inevitably ruined as that 30 seconds passed as usual in the game)  I wouldn't even bother with spending $5 bucks on this unless you are really really patient and know what your getting into to and plan to just try out the game and waste a lot of time doing it.   You can almost be sure you will file this one away as an un-working game in the back of your mind even though you may like the 1 or 2 experiences you have with it when its working. ""always online is fine aside from the fact that even with an 8 core 4.2 ghz processor the game stutteres every few seconds.. going offline stopped this.   Horrific, horrific load times.   Expect to watch literally around 5-10 min of load screens before your actually driving.  3 min load to load your garage w/ one car from the title screen.   Hit escape to ""exit the garage"" and buckle in for another 3 minute load screen.   Drive too fast and fall off the world as it didn't load in fast enough.. back to yet another load screen.   Rivals the previous installment froze the action momentarily if the world didn't load in quick enough.… Expand "

Lack of control options - can't use the mouse in the map and can't map certain keys to the wheel buttons, so you're always reaching for the keyboard for PgUp, PgDn, etc.. And who uses Backspace to get to the menu! No proper manual gearbox - only flappy paddles :-( Races are too short. Not expecting 4-hour race a la The Crew, but 5-6 minutes would be nice. 2 minutes a shot is just too damn short. No mirrors or even a look-back function makes MP racing frustrating. The gameplay is rather vaugue and pointless. Sure you have free-roam, but you quite quickly start to wonder why you even care. There's just not that much to do.  Overall, a poor entry into the series and certainly not worth the asking price, not by a long way. It tries to be NFS Underground 3, but it's not. They should have just remade Undergound 2, pixel for pixel - that would have been better. However, it's not awful and will offer a degree of fun for an evening or two.

The cars aren't that bad, but mediocre. I would love to see a more of a Gran Turismo approach where they license more cars, I don't want 9 types of Nissan Silvias, but at least have most of them. I would rather see 1000 cars where I don't use most of them, than not having any of my favourite cars. The best option would be somewhere in the middle, with S13, S14, 15 and skyline R32, R33, R34 and FC and FD RX7s. What we have now is not enough and sadly GT Sport is going with the less car route too, but that's a story for another day. They should put on at least 5 body kits on every car and 5 options for everything at least, even if it is not official, but make some generic ones. The map is way too small for a game like this, the next should have a bigger map, with not just the city and a bit of a mountain pass, but with deserts, rural areas, mountain roads, etc, just like in the Crew. For me the main thing that ruined the game was the handling, what were they thinking? This is the worst handling I've ever encountered in years, they should make a new one that is more realistic than this. The best would be an arcade-sim crossing in my opinion, because it gives the players a bit more realistic feel to the game, while not making it too hard for casuals to play without any racing experience. The rubber banding is just the frosting on the cake, I can't believe that this piece of junk game mechanic still exists, also make a better Ai, because this one is horrible, this game is like a worse version of the Crew, which had nearly as bad handling as this, but far more serious rubber banding. I didn't pay the full price for this game thankfully, I bought it on a sale last week, but the game just isn't worth a 60 euro price, but not even 30. The story is really bad, it is like it doesn't exist, they should try something like the NFSMW-Carbon story, or the U and U2 one if they really want one. The game has zero replay value and for the starter cars. What were they thinking? The only reasonable choice is the foxbody mustang which i can see as a starter car, but come one a BRZ? That is a 30000$ car! And the almighty Civic TypeR, a great car and all, but they are rare and usually go for 10000$, they should go back and look at the old starter cars from MW and Underground 1 and 2. In U2 you could choose a Corolla AE86, a Miata, a 240sx, Peugeot 206, Ford Focus and a regular (Not TypeR!) civic. In MW you could choose an IS300, a Golf or a Punto. These cars are supposed to be cheap, a TypeR civic and a BRZ is not.  TL;DR: The game doesn't worth your money.… Expand "

The next thing is track path indicator - it has too short draw range, which makes you too much focused on the blue arrows than the race itself, it shows the path that is nowhere close to optimal route, it wiggles time to time for no reason and leads to major confusions, it's often not visible due to ludicrous camera placement in TPP view.  Visual aspect of the game is good, but often it's too dark to notice game breaking elements on the road, so you will crash on them a lot. Actually crashing in this game doesn't feel right, it's either because you didn't notice the obstacle (or couldn't see it because of camera placement), got unlucky and be struck by traffic member or other player or the game will randomly freez or lag. It never feels it was your mistake, even if you drove too fast, it can be blamed on retarded car behavior.  Cutscenes are horrible as well, there is nothing interesting about your new ""friends"", the dialogues (monologues? your character never speaks, which might be actually a good thing since I won't despise him) are dull, shallow and just cringy.

Если игнорировать приглашение, то тебе снова позвонят и скажут что ты их игноришь, и им это не нравиться.  большое количество кастсцен, почти после каждой второй гонки, тебя зовут в кофе где проигрывается сцена, они короткие, но их много, поэтому они не надоедают. сюжет короткий, игру можно пройти за 2-3 дня. как в моем случае, а я бы еще погонял. мультиплер тут вроде не плохой. только вот когда кто то в чего врезается. он не останавливаться полностью. игра через секунду-две спавнит его немножко дальше по маршруту. у меня был такой случай. перед мной гонщик целует стену, я думаю что победа уже моя. но не тут то было, игра заспавнила его впереди меня, вообщем я не смог его обогнать(, и финишировал вторым. Полиция в игре ультра вялая. погонь как в mostwanted нет, да тут вообще нет никаких погонь. на раньих уровнях полиция еще представляет опасность, но после получения 2 уровня обгрейда ты проносишься мимо полиции как в третьем форсаже. понравились заграждения, типа есть пробивные а есть не пробивные. и от вторых надо поворачивать в сторону. так же не понравилось момент старта гонки, нет этих 3,2,1 го. ты просто вливаешься в уже начатую гонку.A как же попадания в идеальные обороты на старте?… Expand "

Yes, I can't say anything other than 2015, because this Need for Speed ​​doesn't have a subtitle. Personally, however, I would call it Underground 3, because it has an undeground touch and looks quite like that, and speaking of what it looks like. That's just beautiful. To this day, the game looks beautiful and overall a shift compared to previous parts. On the one hand, it's probably a night that hides various details in its darkness and the game looks wonderful. Yes. Need for Speed ​​(2015) is at night. Only at night. As was the case with my favorite part, Underground 2. The game again tries to bet on the story. He is not at all for an Oscar, but it must be said that although a lot of players criticize him here, that there are a lot of cringe scenes, I dare to disagree. Not only did the scenes not come to me cringe, but they drew me into the game, precisely because we have real people here and not graphics created by graphics, which also attracted a lot of criticism. Personally, I didn't mind this and on the contrary, I welcomed the fact that the scenes were played. Yes, maybe sometimes the transitions looked weird so that all the cars looked real and your car in the cut-scene was visibly right yours, but still nothing terrible for me. But now for the races. They are here in their full beauty and FINALLY my favorite drift has returned, which I really liked here. In addition to racing after us, there are shelves here and there again, so the game is actually trying to mix the Underground with Most Wantedy and man, it works. At least in my opinion, this combination is fine and the police did not bother me here and did not interfere as much as it was at the end of Most Wanted. I would like to mention tuning, which immediately pleased and then disappointed. Definitely tuning has undergone some upgrades again and you now have such an opportunity to modify your vehicle that it is perhaps not even possible. No really. So many details to play with that I haven't gone through a lot of them for the whole game. For that, I just praise what I criticize is the fact that there are no neon lights again. I would like to add just one word. Why? We didn't even get them in Carbons, so why can't they at least be here? The game has a lively city enough to be here. To understand, I criticized a dead city in Carbon, which glows mostly white, and you neon signs would excel enough, and it would probably look weird. But here I believe it would look good, because the city shines in different colors and has such a nice late night atmosphere. It's a shame. Such a thing, but I really froze me, and what's more, the fact that you still have to be connected to the Internet to play the game. What the hell is a matter of connection when we play a single-player game? Do I have to have internet even for singles? Oh no. Another uselessness that knocks down the game. Summa summarum Need for Speed ​​(2015) is a good game that takes mostly elements of the Underground, although there are no magazines where you were forced to tune your car, for which I praise and adds something from Most Wanted, although you don't have to farm bounty I also praise. It could be, I dare say, one of the best parts of the series, but the absence of neon lights or the need for an Internet connection knocks the game down. So for me, a good game that I recommend.… Expand "

The grip may not be realistic, but it makes sense in certain situations. Take your favorite car and explore the map for 15 minutes, appreciating the well-thought-out viewpoints. The soundtrack is perfectly matched to the game's vibe. The story is cringy but not terrible, focusing on a group of racers trying to impress known figures. The customization has potential but could be improved. The non-gameplay features are incredible, including a network for news, snapshots and detailed stats! This game received updates to make it better, unlike others in the series. Even in 2023, without mods, it's still a fun and enjoyable experience.  Pros: Vibe Grapics (for 2015 they still beat 2022 undbound (imp)) Soundtrack Fun Wrap editor Cutscene details (like having your own car in them)  Mids: Story, great idea, cringy dialouge, but fine considering how car people (or wtv) talk irl, its okay. Custimisation, got a 180 s13? Sure here you go 7 bodykits, got a porsche? We´ll give you one bodykit, a lil wider and thats it. Handling, drift is fine, grip is hell. You wanna grip? Get a mixed tune.  Bad: Always online 350z not in the game. This car wouldve fit so well but its not in the game. I really do miss in in here...  I dont know if its still worth getting into the game since its almost 8 years old and servers could be shut down any second forever making it unplayable, its worth 20 bucks tho.
