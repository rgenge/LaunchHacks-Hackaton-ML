Anyone who has played a videogame will have a shot at getting through the first few rounds and there is enough variety in the games that it doesnt feel like a slog. Replayability is high and if you can gather some friends in a party its a good laugh which we all probably need right now. If you are looking for depth in your games this probably isnt going to suit plus the split on skill and luck can often be 50/50 so im not 100% sure how they plan to take this forward competitively but its easy to watch so the potential is there. As the Devs go forward with new levels and adjusting the current one its only going to be more entertaining, simple formula well executed.

While griefing isn't exactly against the rules, that doesn't mean everyone has to do it as well. What made me write this review was a game that I just played.

That being said that’s not necessarily fall guys biggest problem in the content department... the biggest problem is in its customization... a huge lack of customization options, the store changes every day rather than you saving up your kudos or crowns for a special item you actual want… which leads to thousands of players, looking pretty identical which I feel defeats the whole purpose of a game like a fall guys, this is an individual game show, give me more options to feel like an individual, rather than be a bird or a be a wolf, sorry about the servers you can be a cactus, thanks for the 3 options..overall I really love fall guys, its dumb fun and really hard to put down, there are a few mini games that can sour the fun a bit like tip toes, and obviously people that find ways to cheat, but moments where other players are being jerks and ruining the game for others is few and far between, but with more customizable options that are reasonably obtainable, something to really go for and earn..

Dracoshi,8,"Fall Guys is a really fun game, especially when playing in a party with friends. My only criticism is that there's not enough minigames/game-modes in it - they get very repetitive after playing for a few hours because you've seen all there is to see in the game.

If you are getting hit by something, you can't move for a few seconds.

This get annoying sometimes when you need to cross some narrow platforms and some people do it this way. Some gamemodes (e.g. popping bubbles) are really not fun to play at all because they are based on luck. There are really limited gameplay elements because every rounds are very short, only last for a few minutes or even less than a minute, have to wait for a 2-3 minutes again to play the next round. This ruins the flow of gameplay because of the waiting. The game was only fun when you are completely new to it, but it gets repetitive quite fast.… Expand","Jun 30, 2022"

It's a nice little casual game to get your feet wet with competitive gaming, without the stress and anxiety involved. Sadly, the game in its current state is lacking.

There aren't that manyI like how Fall Guys adapted Mario Party and made it support up to 60 players. It's a nice little casual game to get your feet wet with competitive gaming, without the stress and anxiety involved. Sadly, the game in its current state is lacking. It is good, don't get me wrong, but it is still very much an infant that has yet to grow to its full potential. There aren't that many minigames to play (around 10-15 at most), so it gets stale playing through the same ones over and over. There is a lot of randomness to many of the minigames, and the team-based ones are pretty much a coin flip. (The yellow team is almost always doomed to lose, to the point that you might as well quit the game and join another to save time and energy.) The maps are split into game modes which follow a specific sequence, which means that if you do not reach the final round, you are forced to grind through the same handful of initial maps again, which don't require much skill. Anyone who has played Fall Guys for more than a few hours will tell you the exact same thing: There are not enough minigames. Since the game just released, I'm sure the developers will add more as time goes on, but it simply feels incomplete in its current state. The game will feel fresh for the first day or two, but then it turns more into a grindfest which you alt-tab out of whenever there is downtime between maps. Overall, it is hard to justify the game at its current price, and I recommend holding off until there are at least 20-30 minigames. If and when that happens, supposing I am still playing the game by then, I may consider revising my score.… Expand","Aug 23, 2020"

EnigmaXtreme,7,"When we covered Fall Guys last week during it’s beta, we talked about how fun the game was with its crazy courses and bounce all over the place with your adorable jellybaby like characters. But expressed concern about its longevity from the variety of courses we played, however, we expected that what we were playing was just a mere taste and expected to see a bunch more in the fall game.When we covered Fall Guys last week during it’s beta, we talked about how fun the game was with its crazy courses and bounce all over the place with your adorable jellybaby like characters. But expressed concern about its longevity from the variety of courses we played, however, we expected that what we were playing was just a mere taste and expected to see a bunch more in the fall game. Sad to say that hasn’t exactly been the case. For anyone not aware, Fall Guys is a brand new attempt at Battle Royale, where you play as bizarre little creatures who have a terrible centre of gravity and “wooo” everytime they get knocked over. The game plays a lot like Takeshi’s Castle and Wipeout with many similar obstacle courses like running through doors and avoiding the fake ones, only with more crowding and flailing all over the place. That is the one thing you need to expect while playing Fall Guys, it is going to become an absolute squabble especially when squeezing into such tight places. You play through several rounds trying to avoid getting eliminated in the process and compete for the crown at the end. The game does like to mix it up at times with team-based challenges that usually involve pushing balls, grabbing eggs and chasing people wearing a tail. These can prove quite frustrating, but in that lighthearted funny way as you try desperately to get an egg from your opponent’s goal and just flop everywhere. But other times like the Rocket League knock off can just feel tiresome as you try and shove your ball into the goal. Longevity is going to be the real deal-breaker of this game, I actually found myself getting bored back while playing the beta and was ready to write off the full game when I started playing it today. That is until I won the crown in my first game and modes I didn’t get to play in the beta like Royal Fumble, which involves scrambling for the one tail, were actually quite fun to play. One thing that would be great to see is some variety to each of the levels because then you are just playing the same ones over and over again. The truth is, Fall Guys feels like that quick little game you boot up between other bigger games, its the little snack break in-between titles or the one you play with something else in the background. Much like Tetris 99, it’s best to play Fall Guys in small bursts throughout the day rather than a marathon session. However, the 20$ price tag may deter some players especially the ones who are used to seeing Battle Royale games like this as free to play. However, it seems the game is available for free for PS Plus members. The game does offer cosmetics like new costumes, colours and emotes which are paid for with the games two main currencies, Kudos and Crowns. Kudos is the currency you receive after any match you play (unless the servers disconnect half way through) or purchased with real money but Crowns can only be achieved by winning a game or reaching certain levels. With the lack of lootboxes, I have to praise the game for how it treats its unlockables. The game will offer rare items like an Alyx HL2 outfit for a limited time, but it can only be bought with crowns which are only earned in-game and sure you could buy Kudos with real money but you earn plenty playing as well, so why even bother? Fall Guys is just some real light-hearted fun, something you open up after a long tiresome day and maybe get a few laughs from, and during these times, that is really all you can ask for.… Expand","Aug 25, 2020"
