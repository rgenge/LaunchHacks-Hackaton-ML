Bas92,"Nov 10, 2015",0," Bethesda has learned nothing from F:NV and instead further dumbed down FO3. The Witcher 3 shows how far behind FO4 is in terms of world building, interwoven quests and graphics and of course FNV shows what a true cRPG should look like.

The writing, voice-acting, companions, main quest and lore are again terrible in this game. Bethesda still has no clue what the old Fallout games were all about (really? synthetics all over the place?) Bethesda should have given FO4 to Obsidian and I am giving this a 0 purely for their treatment of Obsidian where they missed a bonus because FNV didn't reach the Metascore target (85/100) by 1 point (and FNV ended up beating FO3 in terms of Steam popularity and user scores everywhere).… Expand "
ShimakazeMG98,"Nov 11, 2015",3, The graphics is looks like s*** The Control makes you crazy... The AI is very damn stupid just standing on the middle of the road while i shooting at them with a mini gun..! LoL Getting the armor suit is very damn easy like no challange or something rewarding. This game is poorly optimized so its a bit laggy and glitchy at some place  soo then this is very much a shame and over hyped... 
Petrosky,"Nov 10, 2015",0," Outdated subpar graphics, poor animations, unintuitive clunky interfaces, recycled gameplay. Incoherent story (you witness Boston being nuked, yet the entire city is intact? I mean come on seriously...) the ending is carbon copied from FO3. This is a lazy cash grab from beth seriously pathetic. "

fakk3,"Nov 12, 2015",0," This game is simply copy and paste of Fallout 3 but with more shooting, action, explosions and BUGS. Dialogues are castrated to short speeches and are similar to Mass Effect. The character development system is simplified and this looks like not in true cRPG. And Where is RON PERLMAN in intro?! How dare you remove so important and canonical voice for this series?! "

Bethesda has finally realized how bad they are at making RPG's so they go all-out with this post-apocalyptic Far Cry. Skyrim with guns? Ha, you wish. At least in Skyrim you had the desire to find out something interesting despite the **** design. In Fallout 4, your desire to vomit stops you even from laughing at the bland characters, HORRIBLE writing, crappy voice-overs, dumbed down systems and retarded AI.  Everything in this game is a step down from New Vegas and even Fallout 3 and Skyrim. Gone are the Fallout skills systems, reactivity and robust dialogue. They way Bethesda bastardized such an important core of Fallout is just baffling to me.  Bethesda has never known how to properly write their games, and Fallout 4 is the ultimate testament to this. The new dialogue wheel is simply atrocious and I don't even want to guess how much ganja was consumed when the storyline was written. The opening is the ultimate cringe, even by Bethesda's standards. Main quest doesn't matter ? Guess neither do characters, side quests and dialogue. Because they are all garbage too.  So, the legendary Bethesda performance? As expected, the game runs like **** and I've encountered more bugs than I care to list. Modders are going to have to work triple shifts to make this console port even semi-playable. I don't even care about the graphics that much, sure they are quite lame considering it's 2015 but art direction is actually alright at times. The lighting makes for some moody environments and gunplay actually feels improved but I am kinda past caring at this point.  Bethesda, you sure never change. You won't even bother to improve the biggest shortcomings and bugs of your previous games. But hey, it's okay when Bethesda does it because their bugs are ""heheheh so funny"".  GOTY 2015… Expand "

The focus on modding / manufacturing turns the game into a scavenger hunt. I got bored building the first settlement and gave up after beds. This is an RPG you are meant to develop your character, if I wanted base building I would play C&C or Minecraft.  The weapons and armour are brutal - pipe guns look horrible and the amount of weapons is sparse compared to New Vegas. Armour similarly looks pretty crap and to be honest I couldn't be bothered with the system as due to the Pipboy interface you cannot tell what you are wearing half the time.  One thing no one has mentioned in their reviews is that in Oblivion they removed the complexity of armour (i.e. there was something like 7 pieces in morrowind as opposed to 4 in Oblivion) due to the load on GPU / CPU. Now they have reintroduced it in this game for some reason?  The final nail in the coffin for me is the total lack of atmosphere in the game, at no point in the nine hours did I feel as engaged as I did in NV.… Expand "

There's no fun at all. The combat is tedious. Yes shooting is improved but everything just jumps you. Some of the first raiders in the game throw molotov cocktails at you which is basically an instakill. Playing on Surival makes everything into a bulletsponge.  The dialogues are completely stupid and make no sense. People don't introduce themselves, you magically know them, because maybe another character is supposed to introduce them. It doesn't matter if you hear the name you just know it all of a sudden. There are no choices. You can either say YES in 3 different ways or NO and leave. Then the game will wait until you say YES.  The fact that it's voiced makes it even worse because it effectively ruins any role playing you might have had intended. I want to be a moronic brute who couldn't care less about any living being yet I have to look for my infant son and love my dog (who chooses to sit on his lap whining after he takes some hits. Then I have to option to heal him with a stimpack but why the **** would I do that when I can just wait 10 seconds and he's happily jumping around again?).  Quests? Can't say because I haven't gotten anything yet. Only quest I got was go there kill the raiders. But that's out of the question because I only have like 200 bullets and there's about 30+ enemies. There's no indication where to go so you just stumble on through the wasteland but you'll come across some tough eniemies right from the bat. There's no pacing of story or gameworld.  The perk system is laughable. Of course it gives you some kind of individuality but in the end it doesn't matter. And even the oh so praised crafting system turns into hoard everything to get adhesive (because you know when you want to harden that metal armor you need some glue...).  You can't kill people that annoy you which in Fallout 4 is EVERYONE. I came across two totally random characters (a woman and her Jet Junkie son) and they were killable. But the first big town and people SIT ON THE GROUND after you hit them. But of course everyone is hostile then and kills you.  I've played through the complete Fallout 3. Not the add-ons but the main game. I was frustrated like everyone else about what they did to our Fallout but damn I took it for what it was, and I even enjoyed it to a degree. But there's absolutely nothing redeeming about Fallout 4.  The graphics are fine since I don't care that much, but the framedrops in certain areas are unbelievable. My system ran Witcher 3 on highest settings.  I am not even mad but rather shocked at how incompetent and uncaring Bethesda really is. Apparently a big sum of the money usually used for development went straight into the pockets of gaming journalists. There's no other explanation for the oustanding praise this pile of **** has garnered so far.  You are embarassing liars.… Expand "

The game has completely lost it's immersion and the world feels cold and empty, it is impossible to forget you are playing a game. The worlds of Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim felt like they were alive, the characters had wants and needs, they had worries, they had motives, I cared about their stories and was able to base my further decisions in the game on those stories and those lives that felt like they really were being affected. The characters in Fallout 4 are a joke, they never feel authentic, though that may be due to the fact that Bethesda took away ALL decision making in this game. There is no choice in dialogue, just different ways of saying the same thing, seriously, your responses do not change anything, at all, ever. There is no weapon repair, there is no skills, SPECIAL doesn't matter, the closest RPG element is the fact that you level up and get ""perks"" (just stat increases, not really perks). You, of course, cannot play a ""role"" as there is no decision making or different between your character and everyone else for the most part., you cannot role play in this game. I could go on and on, but I've been clear, this is not Fallout as you would expect a sequel, this is an open world shooter that takes place in the Fallout world, but this game should not be Fallout 4.… Expand "

It's insulting and depressing how dumbed down it is, with choises that basically don't matter at all. Combined with the skills having been removed, and the fact that there are only perks and SPECIAL now, you can easily see how streamlimed they've made it.

Your choices don't matter. - Bad interface. A pain to use with the keyboard and mouse. - Field of vision too small. Hard to see anything especially with the weapon blocking half the screen. - Bad graphics. It looks like FO3. And FO3 modded looks better than this 2015 release. - The map and world is tiny and restrictive. Unimaginative. Nothing unique scattered around to pique your interest. Feels like they hired mappers who made the rest of the top budget generic corridor shooters. - Boring gameplay. Shoot random enemies that come straight for you or stand in the open firing their weapons at you like there wasn't an AI programmed. And do more of the same. - The world building they hyped up was so preset it felt like grinding to make things appear. Doesn't hold a candle to the Real Time Settlers mod.

I played the first fallout game back in '03 and it was a truly amazing experience.  Then I played 2, and I loved it even more than the first. I was not a massive fan of tactics or BoS, but then again not many people were.  Then came Fallout 3, which at the time I enjoyed but whenever I play it now I struggle to enjoy it. I think the main reason for this was the fact that most decisions did not seem meaningful, and the world seemed like it heavily revolved around the player character, and did not have their own motivations/lives behind the scenes e.g. how you can just do a couple missions, being with a faction for less than a week and become the leader of the faction, which would obviously never happen to anyone but the player.  After that was New Vegas, which is now tied with 2 for my favorite game of all time. It had the new FPS elements but did not sacrifice it's identity as primarily an RPG. It had interesting characters that did not react to the player as the magical center of the universe. Everything was explained, and not only were the dialogue/missions rich in quantity, but they were also rich in quantity. I was also a big fan of the new setting and not to mention, the DLCs were all fantastic (with the exception of Honest Hearts).  Then Fallout 4 was announced, and naturally, I was very excited for it, even though Bethesda made it, and I had not been impressed with any of their recent work. The countdown went down until it reached 0 and the teaser trailer was released. Overall, I liked the new art-style and thought the combat that they showed looked good. At E3 though, they showed the game in much more detail and revealed that they had removed skills, given the player character a pre-defined personality/life, as well as a voice. All of these things were OK with me though, because they could easily be worked around with mods. The thing that really pushed me over the edge was the fact that there are only ever 4 dialogue options now, and they are always pretty much just ""Yes, no, sarcastic or a question"". They even put them always in the same position e.g. Yes is always at the bottom, no on the right, etc. This, coupled with the fact that I already knew that Bethesda really struggled with making interesting stories, meant that this game was going to be an primarily an FPS and secondarily an RPG.  Now that the game has come out and I have sunk 60 hrs into it, I can safely say that I was right. The optimization is awful 90% of the locations are just **** dungeons that you go into, kill some raiders and get some ammo from a crate at the end. The story is terrible, and you get shoehorned into the concerned parent role no matter what you do. These are only the few things wrong with the game that I can be bothered to list.  If you are a fan of 1, 2 and New Vegas, this game is certainly not for you. If you want a really, really dumbed down version of Fallout 3 with better combat then you will probably like it.  The fact that users give this game an average of 5.1 compared to critics with 8.6, shows that critics are not your friends when looking to buy games. I think if you were to compare only the in-depth reviews that talk in detail about all aspects of the game, the average would be between 2 and 4.  tl;dr Don't pay money for this pile of garbage.… Expand "

Dialogue is simply non-existent, the intro is the worst I've seen Bethesda do... it's overly hammed up tripe.... It's bad... like Poltergeist 2 or 3 bad... I'm being spoon fed everything, there is nothing to discover, no mystery, no sense of being in a Falloutesque world.  I feel it's Fallout for a CoD audience.  Maybe I'm fussy, but the intellectual stimulation of a good modern RPG simply isn't here. I honestly feel more immersion in the combat based Dark Souls 1 & 2 than I do this game. AND THERE'S NO DAMN DIALOGUE IN THOSE!! It really does feel like it's been dumbed down so much all immersion has been lost.  Again, I may be a fussy gamer, I still think VTMB is the hallmark of 3d RPGs and I do believe good dialogue makes an RPG... and Fallout 4 has all but done away with dialogue as an in-game mechanism, this isn't a design choice, this is lazy, dialogue trees are hard, and hard to make entertaining, it's easier just not to do them.  The only reason I've persevered thus far is because it's Fallout, and cause I hope it gets better. But I'll be honest, I would have binned this long ago if it were anything else.  So disappointing.

It gets zero from me as it's yet again another half effort attempt to cash in on a franchise that has gained immense popularity by tailoring it to as many different people as possible since the release of Fallout 3.  This is an Rpg in name only, much of what made Fallout an actual rpg has been thrown out for the sake of keeping it ""simple"" to the point the game expects most of its players to be at best children. Mindless action with admittedly superior gunplay are the only things keeping this amusing, with the character models being improved over the hideous ones from the previous 2 games as another bonus.  However the story is as predictable as it is simple, with the writing probably being of the worst quality akin to a B movie script at best. Dialogue is at times cringe worthy, with few characters being in any way interesting to those requiring more than a laser pointer to entertain them. Some characters however I've noted have lots of potential but quickly drop off what with the restrictions of having such a small amount of dialogue present in the game.  And that really sums up Fallout 4 for me; It had so much potential yet dropped the ball in near every way.  You'll see many reviewers giving this title a 10/10 as it diverts further away from what made Fallout great, Rpg elements, grand story and a plethora of well built content to explore. It may be fine as an every gamer kind of game but for true fallout fans, this is one disappointing title.  To rate it as high as far more respectable games such as Witcher 3 or MGS 5 is a notion most would find laughable.  **TL;DR : You like CoD? Hate good story and RPGs? Get this. Other wise, Rent it or wait for Obsidian to do another Fallout. 0/10**… Expand "

It is my contention that Bethesda released this disaster with full expectation of a horde of modders descending on it to fix its many and gratuitous faults. (Hooray, for the modders...Boo for Bethesda for using you as a resource for free labor).  In the wake of The Witcher 3 and yes, even GTA V this can't be the ""masterpiece' that Bethesda wanted to gift the gaming world. The fact that the major review sites can even give it such high scores has permanently damaged my opinion of their objectivity and increased my possibly paranoid belief in a behind the scenes payola scheme.

Fallout New Vegas is a vastly superior game from a gameplay stand point. The game world lacks charm and often doesn't give you enough reasons to mesh with it emotionally. Case in point: the start of the game is too short to have anything resembling a meaningful emotional impact, despite wife, baby and dog. The graphics aren't even true next gen (again, The Witcher 3 makes it look like a late XBox 360 title).  I won't go any further; don't want to spoil the awful for you.  Then again, we have to remember that this is a game from a company that thought it would be ""cool"" to profit off modifications that have traditionally been free, so expecting them to actually invest in and make a game that moves the franchise on in any meaningful way is a tall order.

You may find entertainment in this game if you enjoy shallow, brainless shooters with the ""open world"" gimmick tagged on - because that's all you are getting here. Firsts things first, however; performance. This game performs quite poorly. While at first, it gave me a decent 60fps, performance gradually deteriorated as time went on to the point where the game was nearly unplayable. Stuttering is all over the place, as well as frame rate drops and glitches in textures. Considering that this game is far from impressive in terms of scale and graphics, there is no reason other than sheer incompetence that this game performs so badly. As far as I am aware, this is not limited to my PC (which, I admit, is not top of the range); people with high spec rigs also are reporting serious performance issues with this game. While the performance may have pushed me over the edge with this game, it's problems only begin there. As mentioned previously, the game has bad graphics and visuals. Sure, the animations are an improvement on the last installments. However, these are years old by now, and had bad animations and visuals even for when they were new. Character facial animations are wooden, and animations in dialog often glitch out. All in all, games which came out last year look considerably better than this. Hell, slap an enb mod on skyrim and you have better graphics than fallout. In terms of gameplay, it can be said that there is an improvement over last games. However, gunplay was awful in previous installments, so it isn't really saying much. The combat is mediocre, nothing more. AI is improved, but still pretty retarded. Just like in skyrim, NPCS get stuck on objects when travelling from location to location, take wild detours en route, and overall act like complete potatoes.  In all, combat is playable (when the game isn't stuttering), but nothing particularly entertaining or impressive. The controls and UI however, are terrible. The game was clearly designed around consoles, with PC as an afterthought. Everything involving a ui (looting, crafting, dialog) is a complete chore on a keyboard and mouse setup, and feels clunky. The game feels like a badly done console port when it comes to control and UI. But the real problem with this game is the writing. Fallout was always an RPG. However, most RPG elements are either gone or dumbed down in this game, to the point where it feels like an actions game. Dialog choices are terrible, and you cannot predict what your character is going to say based on the two syllable (at most)  prompts which are given to you. Most dialog choices are ""yes"" ""no"" ""maybe"" or ""sarcastic"". Seriously. Your character will then enact some lines which you had no idea he was going to say upon clicking one of these choices, of which you are given only four. There is no role playing whatsoever, and no real dialogue choices. You cannot decide what sort of character you want to be beyond a minimal ""perk"" system which has little bearing on the gameplay. The story is also completely nonsense. I did not once become attached to any of the characters in it, and did not sympathise with the railroaded protagonist at any point. Finally, the world. Bethesda has always been reputed for large and impressive open worlds. However, the world in this game is not particularly large, nor is it impressive. It lacks the details previous games had, and I am unable to become immersed in it like I was in the mojave or capital wasteland. I am left with no desire to explore, not least because the controls and UI make everything such a chore.  Overall the game improves on combat, making it mediocre in comparison to the terrible combat of the last games. However, every other aspect of the game is a step backwards. Role playing is non existent, dialogue is awful, the writing in ridiculous, the UI is even more consolised than skyrims and the world is boring. Combine this with the glitches, terrible performance and drab visuals, and you're left with a game which fails to live up to expectations, hype, or the standards set by previous titles. Nothing but disappointment, all for £39.99.… Expand "

Morrowwind?  My experience can best be summed up by the super mutant tower. Midway through, somehow I have a 45% chance to miss in vats even though I am point blank but wanted to make sure said mutant died as I was approaching. I am unsure how this is possible to have such a lower percentage but, there it was. Top it off, head shots apparently mean jack now but during the call of duty style rescue mission where you stand with your thumb up your ass waiting for a trolley to get to the bottom of the tower, A super mutant who decided he could tank 5 head shots from a sniper rifle tossed a grande into the trolley, killing me instantly. This isn't difficult, it's just stupid. The settlements are uneventful, ugly and have an aggressively small amount of things to build. Power armor is gimmicky, has no real purpose or any innovation behind it aside from replacing my HUD  with a different one and needing fuel so it can trundle along and be of any use. Sadly, not useful for a sneak/sniper character though it hardly matters cause theres barely any need for perks to make that happen now. Dialogue is crap but we all knew that, same for the story. Game functions fine on my PC but my PC is overkill for this garbage but the bugs are there. Crashes, getting locked into a terminal with no way out. One time I glitched through the map. The companion commands are god awful and rarely get followed and more often than not they just get in the way somehow more often than new vegas which they had to try to make that happen. This game is worth 15$ in a steam summer sale and I am glad I got it at GMG for 25% off cause had it not been discounted I'd have been seriously ticked. Bethesdas now on a list of devs I'll only pirate from but the only saving grace is skyrim was enjoyable and I never paid for it so here you go Bethesda. Maybe if they took all the effort into make the dumb robot at the start say everyone's name (Though somehow Kyle slipped them through, but not Boobies, Idiocy of the devs I imagine) they could put that into something that matters. Only points it gets is for being function on a gunplay only level and that is its only meret.

Once you start building stuff you see how shallow it is. Everything you build is rusty and decaying despite being brandI'll give you an unbiased review.  First - Gameplay: -If you try to play it in third person inside a building, you can't. Trying to pick up an item, pressing a button or shooting an enemy is a chore because of the bad camera; -The settlement building is ok at best. Once you start building stuff you see how shallow it is. Everything you build is rusty and decaying despite being brand new. There isn't much variety in what you can do with the settlement building and if you try to build walls on any terrain that isn't completely flat you will see the disaster, you will see how rushed and shallow this gimmick is. It is a great idea that suffers from poor execution. -The weapon crafting is the same as settlement building. Great idea that suffers from poor execution. Not only the weapons are ugly, but they look like something straight out of Borderlands. They don't look like real pipe weapons at all.  Just compare them to the Bosnian-war homemade weapons. -Power Armor suffers from the exact same problem as weapon crafting and settlement building: Poor execution. 10 minutes into the game you get the power armor. Another 10 minutes and you are swimming in fusion cores. The Power Armor in the Fallout franchise is supposed to be a really rare and end-game armor, not something you get in the first 10 minutes. This completely undermines it. -It is cool that enemies take cover now, but their AI is still as bad as it was in Fallout 3. -No sense of self-preservation, the enemy who is wielding a bat sees you in a power armor with a minigun and he/she still runs towards you and tries to kill you with his/hers bat. -Melee is still the same bad thing from Skyrim. Enemies standing still while hitting each other. Piper was just there gun-butting the Super Mutant in the head while the Super Mutant was hitting her with a piece of wood. -Bullet sponges. I played the game on Survival and there is no difficulty except for artificial difficulty a.k.a. bullet sponges. The enemies aren't clever, their AI is not improved, they are just turned into bullet sponges. Then there are some that are LEGENDARY bullet sponges that can ""mutate"" and restore their healths fully. This is not difficult at all. This is boring and turns the gameplay into a chore. I love when enemies outsmart me and I have to outsmart them, this is difficulty, but turning a dumb enemy into a bullet sponge is not difficulty. It is a really bad gameplay design.  Second - The World and Lore: -If you ever played Fallout 1, 2 or New Vegas you probably understand how wrong the world of Fallout 4 is in the setting. If not, then there is no point explaining it here since it would take more than 5000 characters, but just a quick thing: Fallout is a post-apocalyptic game not focused on the destruction of the wasteland, but on the people rebuilding, the world being rich culturally and society going back to the way it was. You don't have that in Fallout 4. You have an empty world devoid of content (unless you call content the same copy-pasted ruins with the same ghouls or raiders, which I don't). And, oh yeah, plastic and micro-electronics in Fallout 4, both of them shouldn't exist because of the petrol shortage in the setting. -And why is the BoS destroying technology? They are hoarders, they want technological supremacy and to do that they hoard every piece of technology so their scribes can study them and make advancements. But in Fallout 4 they want to destroy technology.  Third - The Characters and Interactions: -Fallout was always a game with charming characters, clever dialogue, dark humour and good voice acting. But no single character in Fallout 4 ever acts, speaks or thinks like a human being. -Courtney Taylor who amazingly voiced Jack in Mass Effect 2 and 3 (one of my favourite video-game characters) was bad in Fallout 4, same as the male voice actor. If you can make a competent voice actress like Courtney Taylor sound bad, then you have a huge problem with the dialogue of your game. -The only good character was Nick Valentine. He was a easy one to write, just a copy-pasted noir detective, but still I have to give props to Bethesda for including him.  Last - The plot: -After the intro happens, you say ""I'll find whoever did this"", then 2 minutes after that you see a Cryolator Pistol locked in a case and says ""Nice! I'm coming back for you later!"". Then five minutes after that you find Codsworth and says ""B-but it's all... dead..."". Then five minutes later you are already cracking jokes (""SARCASTIC"" option in dialogue). -You are supposed to care about your family but you don't spend even 3 minutes with them. There is no bonding moment, nothing. The game forces you some strangers, say that they are your family and you're supposed to care. -No roleplaying possibility. You can either say yes, say yes in a sarcastic manner or says no that leads to the same thing as saying yes. No evil choices. Only flavours of saying yes.  So I have to give the game a 1/10 because I liked Nick.… Expand "

Outside of that it is a sub par creation unworthy of the reputation of Bethesda.  As far as role-playing goes, there are only 3 types of human bad guys, with one of the types optional. You can't be a bad person in this game until the end. I won't spoiler the ending, but the game holds your hand until you make a mass effect like decision at the very end, and it only affects what reward video you see. The game also forces you to acquire a dog, you can get rid of him by telling him to stay. The feature promoted at E3 if you have one of the 1000 names, every npc will call you by that name. Unfortunately, only one NPC (the mr.handy at the beginning) will actually say your name.) In addition, Bethesda ensured to give profanities priority over actual names. You can be called **** **** you name it, but ""Kyle""? Nope.  The powerarmor is one of the few assets that's fun. Unfortunately, the worth of powerarmor is hugely diminished by the ability to acquire it (if you go raider hunting) from near the beginning of the game and wear it. In addition, the game is too short that once you get it in the main quest about 3 hours later, you are almost finished with the game. The jetpack also breaks the game. NPCs can not respond to you when you are above them. They won't run into cover, or try to reach you, unless they are at the same ground level as you.  The legendary items are stupid gimmicks. There is a double barrel shotgun that you never have to reload. Item customization isn't really that much better. Its nice that you can change style of play... but you will end up using the same mods over and over again, because they actually make a real and heavy change.  The wasteland construction also really serves no point. You can make nice structures, but you have a base already given to you, and you need its utility. Its a utility that can not be replicated. Therefore, you can build around your already established base, but nothing will attack it because its a protected area where no hostile will spawn.  The voice acting is also annoying and have kirks. The characters are one dimensional, and serve only one purpose. There is little or no character development in this game. They also sandbox terribly, run into walls, and overall be buggy. You can't kill the characters unless they are the only one of the three types I mentioned before. Therefore, if a character is never bad... they are invincible. You can't do mass murder sprees and wipe out towns like you use to.  Overall... This is a game in a sandbox that has a track. You can play in the sandbox a little with exploring and building creation, but other then that it doesn't serve its purpose as a fallout game. You can't play in the sandbox in protected areas like towns, the main base (you can build around there though), and places where the story take place. Other then being in the sandbox, its like being in an amusement park ride.  The graphics requirements for this game are too high for what it offers. It just looks bland, and some structures look absolutely low res, even on ultra. View distance has been noticeably slashed from previous games.

You can't craft ammo and vendors never carry enough ammo, so once you're done with all 300 5mm bullets, you will probably never regain the loss, and the minigun becomes almost completely useless. The Fat Man's mini nukes seem more common than 5mm bullets...  The companions are pretty boring and don't have quests like they do in Fallout: New Vegas. The way you get them to like you is also pretty boring; especially Codsworth, where all you have to do is upgrade your power armor. The amount of names Codsworth can say is pretty impressive, though. Other than that, the dog (as seen in the trailers) is even more boring. Unlike something like Rex in Fallout: New Vegas that would have quests and a story, the dog in this is just for the trailer it would seem. They don't do much.  The quests are very bad. Most of them are fetch quests or quests to clear areas. It gets very, very boring very fast.  The ""legendary"" creature system sucks, and makes areas either too easy or way too difficult; especially when you end up getting a high level legendary enemy that can kill you in one hit. I've even had two spawn at the same time.  The dialogue is very vague. I'm sure everyone knows by now.  The perk system sucks compared to Fallout 3 or New Vegas. There are no perk/skill/stat-based dialogue checks. So if you liked having a very perceptive or intelligent, maybe even a cannibalistic character with some cool dialogue, say goodbye to that, because now charisma is all that matters with any dialogue. Also, it makes the game way more linear. You can't make your character a good hacker early on because there's an unnecessary level requirement for things that seem like a fair trade for a perk point.  Almost every NPC is essential, even if they don't serve a purpose.  There's a lot more, but I can't be bothered.… Expand "

The story on the other hand is completely abysmal there is no interaction between your husband or child making his death completely pointless and I found myself having no motivation what so ever to find Shaun besides the quest requires me to. The whole plot twist with your child now being a elderly man was completely pointless as you have no reason to care about this character,the game completely lost me when I had to decide my ""faction"" because each of their quests are so limited and you basically do the same thing in each quest.  In my play through I sided with the BOS and I found it complete stupid how in the final mission you blow up the institute,the brotherhood is about preserving technology and there you just nuked the biggest cache of technology available.  I also found quest structure completely worthless as I felt some of the things I was being forced to do I wouldn't have done if i had my own option this is only limited more by the terrible speech system.

I also found the environments and city's lacking character and lore they are only there as a trading hub and giving you a minigun and power Armour that early in the game is completely infuriating.

I mean, don't get me wrong, you can still make some choices, tho in the end, they do not really matter. You are not playing Your character, you are playing Bethesda's one. Dialogue options are, in most cases ""Yes"", ""No"", ""Sarcasm"", ""Goodbye"". Remember New Vegas, finding your own way toward the end, backstabbing the faction you've worked for just to gain all the power for yourself? Do you want to see something like that in Fallout 4? Yeah, me too.  World of Fallout 4 is full of places to see, Raiders to kill, crates to loot, Feral Ghouls to kill, landmarks to see, Raiders to kill, people to talk, Feral Ghouls to kill. You can even take a follower with you, like one of the Minutemen, a great faction that after first quest - killing raiders - makes you their leader and send you to do other quests - killing raiders. Half of the game is killing raiders, And feral ghouls. And closed doors that can be only unlocked by a console next to them. No hacking needed, just use console, use only option ""Unlock doors"" and... viola, the doors are open.  It was realy hard for me to ""get into"" this world, it felt so unreal. Level scaling feels clumsy as hell. Let me give you an example. I'm killing two raiders wearing Power Armors in Camp A. Nothing hard, few shots, they are down, I'm barely bruised. 100 meters from Camp A I've found Camp B with higher level raiders. Guard dog one-shots me. Yay, hurray for the attack dog!.  Crafting system makes you collect all the trash, pop it into workbench and change some aspects of your weapon. This is actually a nice feature, tho it's nothing special, just a fun lill addition (that we all know from F3/FNV mods *cough*). ""Bob the builder"" mode on the other hand feels like uncompleted fan created mod. Clumsy, clumsy, clumsy and pointless.  Overall Fallout 4 don't feel like this AAA that Bethesda promised us. It's more like a community made big patch/update rather then a effect of 7 years work). It works, but it felt so stiff and clunky. Sure, after some time modders will turn it into something better, no doubt about it.

Plus the the dialogue wheel thing; I always thought that people exaggerate when criticizing ME in that respect, but in this game it's really badly executed and I feel like I have no control over what my character is going to say. For example, I can never tell if ""sarcastic"" means that my milf is about to tell a joke or something mean to the speaker. It's a bit like playing that retarded mini-game from Oblivion, except without hints as to how the NPC is going to react. The facial animations are abysmal and somehow worse than before.  The whole parenting emotional bull***t is a total failure, not only on it's own (the beginning is probably the most cringeworthy of all Bethesda games), but also because of how over the place the pacing is; ""Oh no, they killed my husband""  ""Hell yeah let's kick some asses God bless America!""  Graphics are f*****g ugly - not really because the quality, but that pastel and glary color palette that messes with your eyes. What I find the biggest annoyance, though, is that the environment is so viciously bright. Seriously, it feels like a flash bomb went off in the sky permanently.

Writing. This is the biggest issue for me, and it's something I've always disliked bethesda for. Their writing sucks and with the exception of one or two masterpiece quests always has. It's bland and dull, often doesn't make sense, morality is always black and white, character motivation is frequently unclear, and in this case a lot of what they've written doesn't mesh with established lore in the Fallout universe (which is a huge annoyance factor, especially as I assume this means they're just retconning a lot of the older games). They can't even get their own lore right sometimes. Bethesda's writing has been something I've had a minor issue with since Oblivion, but since playing New Vegas it's been accentuated.  2. Choice. There is hardly any. There's an illusion of choice, but if you try and actually do anything but the obvious route it hamfists you back into it. From the very get-go with the salesman, if you try and decline your wife eventually steps in and you go through the same screen. You know what would have been fairly easy to do and enhanced that scene a ton? Allow the player to decline, then have the television announcement anyway and when you run up to the vault the soldiers won't let you in. Maybe add a speech check, or allow you to sneak past them somehow, or hell maybe even fight them to get through. If you can't, the bombs fall and you die (which they actually already added if you run too far up the street instead of going to the vault). You see what I'm getting at? Having multiple ways to solve something is intrinsic to Fallout. Most quests that I saw in my time playing were simply, ""Go here, kill everything"" or sometimes ""Go here, kill everything, fetch something"". Fallout 1, 2, NV, and to a lesser extent 3 allowed you to go through a whole hell of a lot of the game without escalating to violence, and they all had more interesting stories and better writing attached to each quest. It really seemed like most quests in Fallout 4 are just an excuse to give you more silhouettes in the shooting gallery. Don't like Preston Garvey? Want to do something other than get in the power armor and shoot stuff? Too bad, either do that or don't do the quest. There are options in most quest dialogues that suggest other routes, but actually choosing them either puts you on the same route with the same quest objective or just nets you a ""come back later if you change your mind mane"" response. Illusion of choice. And of course unkillable NPCs are back in full force. Add to all of this the fact that your character is now voiced, and it has removed almost all RP potential.  3. I don't like the scrapping of the leveling system that has been with the game since the first. I don't consider this as major a point as the others since Fallout has undergone considerable change in it's gamesystems from 1-NV and still managed to hit the right notes, but the new system seems too 'casual' (for lack of a better word) for my tastes. It reminds me too much of Skyrim. Still, more personal preference than anything else. I know another fan of the series who primarily plays the originals who was praising the new system for fixing inherent issues in the previous SPECIAL system. Like high-INT builds being way overpowered, and that sort of thing.  Other than that, the game does an okay job. The visuals are good enough and I love the art direction, though they could be better and things like not having parallax mapping on brick walls is baffling. The crafting and settlement building is great. The new Power Armor system is very cool, even if fusion cores run out in minutes instead of the lore-accurate years or lifetimes it's supposed to take. Gunplay feels fantastic. Animations are for the most part pretty good. Characters emote and move around instead of standing stock-still when talking to you, and I would have loved the new dynamic dialogue system had they removed the voiced player character and not **** up the choice aspect so much. And exploration is, as always, fantastic (that's the one thing Bethesda consistently gets right). If it weren't selling itself as Fallout I would have probably enjoyed it, but as it is I can't. It just feels wrong somehow. I'm just waiting for the announcement of the Obsidian 'spinoff' so I can enjoy all the things I like about Fallout with the work Bethesda has done on the engine, art, animations, crafting, etc.… Expand "

This game attempted to be much more than it delivered, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth.  People do not want an RPG's dialogue to consist of YES, NO, SARCASM, MAYBE. This is a joke. I get it the game has to evolve over time and voicing dialogue may be a future evolution, but we aren't there yet. Why? Because when you voice dialogue and make a Mass Effect wheel you create Mass Effect. I didn't buy Fallout 4 to get Mass Effect. Modding will not save this game from the absence of story.

I was gonna write a list about the negatives of this game but you can just read the comments from other people. Bethesda said ""it's not meant to be the most stunning RPG ever"" however they ended up making the most crappy game because they didn't even tried at the first place. The only reason this game sold the copies was because of the marketing and the fact that is was a fallout series. Had it been not, none would have played this garbage. And for the people expecting modders to fix it, i hope they(modders) don't even bother with this trash game. The only thing Bethesda could do worse, would be an in-game store to buy fuse cores to use the power armor.  And one last thing ""We want this massive interactive world, where you can talk to people, choose your own path and everything in the world has meaning and is an actual object."".

If you expect anything like a compelling story or an important leveling system you will be let down.  The graphics in this game were very poor. The lighting is improved from Skyrim but the textures are terrible. My fallout actually looks worse than Skyrim because I had a few mods to improve Skyrim. This game will definitely look better in the future with mods, but to be so similar to a game as old as Skyrim is disrespectful to customers.

Главное это атмосфера. Атмосфера это то что отличает великую игру от хорошей. Атмосфера это сверх тонкая материя, это душа произведения. Создают атмосферу фанаты своего дела, любящие то чем они занимаются, люди с широким кругозором, люди знающие жизнь не по наслышке, видящие фальш в любом произведении, в любом действии, люди знающие как надо, имеющие чувство вкуса и такт. Атмосфера в играх создается за счет реализма и тщательной проработке деталей. Каждая деталь должна продумываться с позиции здравого смысла, а для этого нужно иметь огромную фантазию и широкий кругозор. И если в ваших деталях создающих атмосферу затесалось несколько (не говорю о большом количестве) фальшивых, то все начинает сыпаться. Человек на подсознательном уровне понимает, что то тут не так, что его дурят и атмосфера улетучивается подобно утреннему сну. Атмосфера была в первых двух частях Fallout, но увы ни в третьей ни в четвертой ее нет. Bethesda не в состоянии передать дух оригинала, ребята хотят, но не могут, похоже не один человек в компании не способен понять в чем секрет духа Fallout, не способен объяснить это себе и остальной команде разработчиков. Они не понимают что дух строиться из мелких достоверных деталей. Мелкие достоверные детали это не детализированные убежища в Fallout 4 по которым бегают бездушные высокополигональные болванчики, не понатыканные где ни попадя скелеты в одежде призванные сделать нам ""Атмосферненько""  Детали это проработка вещей опираясь на здравый смысл, логику, но в тоже время без перегибов. В игре прошло 200 лет, двести мать их лет!!! Разработчики не в состоянии осознать эту цифру - это печалит и раздражает! За двести лет ландшафт может поменяться до неузнаваемости, песчаные бури, ветра заметают все на своем пути, потоки воды размывают, мусор гнеет, железо ржавеет и превращается в ржавый прах, скелеты жертв ядерного взрыва уходят глубоко под землю, растаскиваются животными, рассыпаются под действием солнца и воды. А что мы видим? Разруху как после не сильного торнадо! Свеженькие скелеты жертв ядерного взрыва! Отполированного робота на ходу! Это один из самых сильных ударов по атмосфере игры, сразу в лоб, с самого начала, чтоб не питал иллюзий. Прошло максимум 25 лет, но никак не двести. Взрывающиеся машины, это бесило еще со времен fallout 3, не должно остаться не одной покрашенной машины за 200 лет. Собака Горец Маклауд, почему не сделали собаку главным героем, ведь она такая крутая. ГГ таскающий миниган с вертибайдера без силовой брони - это смотрится ну просто нелепо, Арни из хищника рыдает при виде этого действа. Куча всякого не нужного и нужного хлама на полках, который можно собирать, его настолько много что глаз замыливается с самого начала, не понятно что надо, а что не очень. Собирательство превращается в рутину, от которой просто тошнит. У вещей нет стиля, нет индивидуальности, тоже и касается оружия. Ты находиш столько стволов, что можеш открыть 15 оружейных магазинов через 5 часов игры, оружие безликое, ты не ощущаеш его ценности, его желанности. Оружие и вещи обесценены. Пять домов считается городом, условности на каждом шагу. Персонажи в квестах ведут себя как идиоты больщую часть времени, ты не вериш им, многие поступки не логичны с позиции здравого смысла. Квесты высосаны из пальца, многие из них не логичны и не есттественны и нужны только ради наполнения игры контентом. Урезанные диалоги были введены под предлогом удобства, на самом деле причина проста.- Не хочет и не может разработчик придумывать интересные диалоги и истории - это вам не ребята ролевики с огромной фантазией из Black Isle и Troika Games, способные на ходу рождать захватывающие истории. Ролевую систему порезали до нельзя, теперь абсолютно без разници как ты изначально распределил параметры персонажа, зачем тебе это, ты ведь все равно играеш в шутер.- Смысл ролевой системы пропадает. Кривая расчелененка, головы противников взрываются уж слишком часто. Игра не учитывает калибр и силу оружия, стреляеш из пистолетика или из дробовика, голова разлетится в любом случае. Не покидает ощущение Ощущение пластмассовости мира, что это все декорации с неумными статистами. Видно что разработчики делали игру не потому что им было что сказать, а потому что им нужно было ее сделать, потому что надо было заработать денег. Это не произведение искусства, это не игра которая станет классикой, это разуляпистый, цветастый, с кучей всего ненужного, малодушный, скучный комерческий продукт. Который найдет свою аудиторию и несомненно будет очень успешным, а другого и не надо, в наш век погони за баблом другого ожидать не приходиться. Это касается не только Fallout 4, а большинства современных игр. Игры с душой сейчас выходят крайне редко и являются настоящим праздником, но это не про Fallout 4.

But it does come with the name Fallout 4. Certain expectations come with it. Namely it being and RPG. You know. Role playing game! It all goes out the window when you start talking with npc's. Your dialogue options are minimal and i can't for the life of me to relate to the main character. This dialogue system is not new and can be good if done right. I actually liked it in Mass Effect, since ME was basically a playable movie type game it fitted there, you played the hero and the dialogue was befitting for it. It wasn't a real RPG game so it worked. Had they gone fully the ME dialogue route my character would have been a total badass in a good or bad way. But instead we get a dialogue system that is just all over the place. Many times i'm unsure what he is going to say next and the responses just felt flat and uninterested. The Dialogue in Fallout 1&2 was one the best all time and what we get now pales in comparison. I don't mind that they tried to innovate the series with a voiced protagonist since if done right it can be awesome (witcher,mass effect), but they failed.  Removal of Skills. Again a bad decision. No more character specialization just pump up your s.p.e.c.i.a.l to 10 on everything and pick up every single perk and there you go, you are a god so much fun right? Yeah you can do that just keep lvling.  The story falls flat and fails to keep me interested in the characters and factions. No surprise there after skyrim. But in Skyrim the gameplay and character building made up for the lack of story. Here nothing holds the game together.  Companions then? Bad ai, getting in the way, op killing machines, and they cannot die.  The UI? A clunky mess and not fitted for PC mouse&kb. Same goes for the rest of the game. Not fitted for PC period.  This game was made for consoles in mind now actually this part doesn't surprise me one bit though i was counting on it.  The game is pretty stable for a Bethesda game. I only experienced a handfull of ctds. But the glitches and bugs are a plenty.  I was so happy back when Bethesda started working on a Fallout game. I would finally see another game in my favorite setting. Fallout 3 came and to this day i don't get the game of the year label it got. It was better then Fallout 4 right out the box though. Still i felt like Fallout series as i knew was over up until Obisidian came with New Vegas. My faith was restored. And i bought in to the hype hoping that they learned from the mistakes of FO3 and made improvements to FO4 and took notes from New Vegas. They did not. And apparently they are going on their own way with this series. A direction i don't want to follow anymore. I will not buy another Bethesda game on launch. Maybe after heavy sales and patches&mods have fixed their garbage launch versions. And i will not play another Bethesda Fallout game period. My hope in the series is with Obsidian or another company making them in the future. If Fallout remains with Bethesda the series is dead to me.

If you are expecting to immerse yourself in deep story and building your character your own way and taking on the tasks at hand by various different means.

If you were hoping of something as good as FO:NV not a chance. You're better off spending the $10 to buy both, and install the Tales of Two Wastelands mod, which combines both places into the FO:NV engine.  That will let you enjoy a lengthy game, with better game play, story, and graphics options.  Other people have covered everything else in more detail, so there's no point in making this larger.  Story/VO:  There is no real story here.  It's an abysmal piece of writing that would have had your grade 9 English teacher tell you to rewrite it.  If you were expecting an option where your choices changed the outcome or gave you variable choices, it's not going to happen.  Since your PC is now voiced, many actions also have a very wooden feeling to them.  Controls/UI: Terrible, no other way to put it.  Your dialog choices are determined by your cursor keys, the pipboy system is a mess.  Perk tree is beyond simplistic, and in some cases doesn't clearly state what it does.  Graphics/Textures are...washed out, no other way to put it.  It looks like someone took the texture palette, smeared in some brown and yellow, photocopied it, re-imported into PS then made it into a 128x128 sized texture block.  Game play elements/Dialog:  There are no skills, which are replaced by a perk system.  The perk system itself is a complete joke of any previous FO game.  Dialog doesn't exist, it's a story on rails.  Karma?  No karma for you, that's too difficult for people to grasp apparently.  Crafting:  Probably the only redeeming part of the game.

Крафт, например, отличная задумка. Просто если бы разработчик делал игру, а не чесал жопу в ожидании денег, то все могло получится. По факту, даже со всеми минусами это не плохая игра.

Their adverts are everywhere, so you would hope for something that they were building to be this massive would be at LEAST as good as Fallout 3 or New Vegas.  Sadly this is no where near Fallout 3, let alone the improvement of its successor NV.  Negative points: -Weapons clunky and unaimable -Removal of immersion and customization -Perk system just a number improvement across everything (They should have looked at what made More Perks mod for NV/F3 so interesting) -The stolen mod idea taken from Wasteland Settler by Akooka for F3/NV is one of the key selling points of the game, but they didn't really improve on his work - in fact they somehow made a worse version of it. -Lips are not synced to voice actors, which they somehow managed to do with F3NV but not F4? -Story seems really poorly paced, even with forced drama nothing 'draws' you in like it did in the last two Bethesta Fallouts -Power armor at level 2 -Feels more like an arcade shoot'em up than an immersive RPG -  Neutral points : Graphics naturally improved over predecessors, not to 2015 level (Thanks consoles) but to about a 2011 level  Positive points + House interiors are finally part of the worldbox in most cases ( - however there are still mostly boarded up houses everywhere)  In summary, Bethesda should have what made NV so great and built on that. They did the right thing with taking the Wasteland Settler Mod and using it as part of the core game, HOWEVER, they should have seen what else people were using and included those mods, rather giving another lowest common denominator cash-in that feels and plays like they spent $1 million on development and $20 million on marketing.… Expand "

Graphics are dated and glitchy, buggy but not as bad as FO3 at it's release. Gunplay is better but since this now basically a FPS instead of an RPG it had better be. UI is TERRIBLE with locked hotkeys and no consideration for lefties. Ai is below average as well. I tried to like it, I really did. I'm a huge fan of the series but after about 5 hours in I just sighed and gave up. There was nothing to compel me to play anymore as the main story was lame and the dialogue was boring and pointless. The game may actual be good after a year or so when the modders work their magic but until then I would stay away. Sad day.… Expand "

sonofdad,"Nov 10, 2015",3, Its stripped down rpg elements make this the worst Fallout of the series. I like a lot of what Bethesda has done with the game but limiting the player's choice in character creation and dialogue is a huge misstep. They've made a ton of improvements since Fallout 3 but for whatever reason completely neutered what makes the franchise so great to begin with.

And when cleared, give random, usually useless loot, just like - you guessed it - Skyrim. Jerky animations, half-finished physics, ugly textures and horrible gunplay, not to mention terrible UI and game design choices make whole thing feel like Unreal Tournament mod from 2004, badly hidden under modern shaders and Ambient Occlusion. Well, and a bit higher polycount. As desperately as I didn't try to get into it, I found that I just don't care. I don't care about 60's style (that feels more like a gimmick than art direction), annoying robots with British accent (which Portal 2 did much better), empty landscape that has dungeon or quest at every step (but of which none matters) and gunplay that is just nowhere as solid and elegant than other games do, say - Half-Life 2 from 2007 or even Call of Duty.  In general, it's the same stupid game with exactly same content and horrible, unmanageable UI (that has no place in PC game to start with) that Bethesda has been making for years.

It's not terrible, but it's not as good as a ""Fallout"" game. The storyline is an utter crock of crap with completely unlikable characters as your leaders (whom you have to choose one of them to progress the story). You can't be your own leader (like in New Vegas, with Yes Man [my favorite ending]) and the voiced character interactions force the character to completely align themselves with the faction you are following to finish the game no matter how much you don't agree with their teachings. I agree with certain things and disagree with others with factions, yet my character is 100% gung-ho with the faction's mindset (no matter how **** up it is). The four choices you have to choose from almost always are just you saying the same thing in a different way (either in a nice way, a snarky way, a passive aggressive way, or you just ask a question to get more info). Also, no matter what you choose the response from the NPC is the same; your decisions carry literally no weight in 90% of interactions. And because you character speaks beyond what the text is, a lot of the time they say things that you didn't want to say at all. This is also contributing to the character's ridiculous attitude that goes into one of the three faction's beliefs like a puzzle piece during dialogue; which for me, who is cycling through the 3 factions at the moment, my guy goes from an extreme stance on something to the complete opposite extreme within just a few minutes from different conversations with different faction leaders. It completely breaks the immersion to have such a ridiculous character that I can't relate to in the slightest. His reactions are inhuman and stale as **** during the somewhat emotional scenes, goofily stupid and unbelievable during the extremely emotional scenes, and bland as can be during normal dialogue (with constantly changing morals and beliefs based on who he is speaking to, literally like changing from one character to another).  While I could go on about the travesty that is Fallout 4's dialogue and story, I feel like going any further would just be rambling. I could also go on to talk about how unbalanced Power Armor is and how it feels like a mundane task to deal with it now, or I could talk about the terrible town crafting mini game that is worse to use than Halo 3's Forge mode (something from many years ago), or how all of the comedy has been sucked out of the game and replaced with terrible soap opera levels of stupid drama and its slightly cartoonish feel/look replaced with something straight out of Gears of War's rectum levels of brown, or I could even go on to speak about the terrible new perk system and how inconsequential/creative the perks feel; I literally don't even notice them anymore during gameplay. I could.. but instead I'll just say: ""If you want a Fallout game like 3 or New Vegas, buy Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas. Don't buy Fallout 4. It's a heap of trash compared to those two games. It compares to a more bland, ridiculous, boring, and stupid version of Mass Effect; where the acting is terrible, your character doesn't give a **** about what you them to act like as a player, and every moment of the game is about as enjoyable as the ending of Mass Effect 3. Bethesda saw that everyone was enjoying First Person Shooters many years back and decided to turn Fallout 4 into that. It's not a good game anymore. It's combat is worse than the more popular FPS games on the market and it's generally mediocre to absolutely terrible as an RPG.""  If you're just looking to kill some time with a game that will get you addicted, then wait until this game isn't so ridiculously priced. It's worth about $15, so buy it once you can get it for that price or cheaper.  Also, as expected from a Bethesda game, Fallout 4 is littered with bugs and glitches. Not even fun or funny ones like in Skyrim, but just really annoying/game-breaking ones.… Expand "

They got rid of the meaningful choices in dialogues and the perks that comes along with it. There's four brief options in total when it comes to choosing what you wish to say and you'll spend most of the time second guessing since your character is voiced now. No longer do you have a hardcore mode and skills that directly affects your percentage bonus of your attributes. No karma and reputation system to screw up and care about. Instead, you're stuck with a typical casual shooter experience. There's no level cap whatsoever, as you can max out every SPECIAL stats and perks that comes along with the game, (which is mostly combat related and crafting, not that you'd want to anyway since you'd be long bored by then.) Not only is your character voiced now but they also have a defined story, he/she is married with a children. Years passes and a tragedy happens, you're now out for revenge. I'm not gonna spoil the story but it's extremely predictable and cliché, not to mention tiresome. You'll be spending most of your time doing fetch quests and kill x stuff, the rest is spent on crafting (which we'll get into later). Now that we got this out of the way, what about the PC performances? Well for starter this game still runs on the creation engine, so physics will go **** if you decide to play any higher than 60 fps, (not that it matters anyway since there's no SLI/Crossfire support and good luck to anyone with a high refresh rate monitor) it also sports extremely outdated visuals for a game that's nearly released in 2016. Mouse acceleration and sensitivity out of the wazoo, and forced on you. You'll have to manually sort through tons of files just to disable them manually (because they couldn't bother enough to include them in the options menu). The controls are extremely bad and awkward, some keys aren't even rebindable (Trust me when you get to building your own settlements,  you'll see what I mean.) and the dialogue is a mess. An absolute disservice to loyal fans of the franchise, this game isn't even half what Fallout used to be, it's actually the direct opposite.

DamianV,"Nov 11, 2015",1," Of course I could start off my review by pointing out all the terrible design choices that Bethesda made. However, this would be redundant since all the other reviewers that gave the game a score of 2 or less have already got it right.

However, this would be redundant since all the other reviewers that gave the game a score of 2 or less have already got it right. No need for me to repeat how shamefully dismal this piece of crap of a game is.  So instead I'll simply give an example of a further aspect of the game that is so laughably terrible that it is actually nearly entertaining again: companions and their AI, combined with the fact that they cannot die.  So here's my story: I started out as usual in a vault, explored it, looted it and finally left for the great wasteland (which is actually tiny, only about 8-10 minutes of walking to get from one side to the other). At the second location I meet a dog which then starts following me around without me really wanting it (likely due to the terrible pseudo-RPG dialog system which seems to be designed for people that can't actually read). Ok, ok, so now I have a Dog companion, whatever. So I continue down the road and come to a run-down town and think ""yay, loot!"" and proceed to loot and ramsack every house I can see, one after the other. After about the third house I noticed that my worthless companion was no longer blocking my movements (yay) and was no longer in sight (yay again). Ok, whatever, didn't want a stupid dog in the first place. But then I suddenly start hearing gun shots an shouts in the distance but I couldn't actually see any hostiles so I decided to simply ignore the noise and continue looting the town. So after about 10 or 15 minutes I finished looting most buildings and come up to a larger building in the middle of the town which obviously triggers some kind of quest: dudes start shouting about evil raiders attacking and that I should come inside so I don't get shot. I think ""yeah, whatever"" and continue walking around and then suddenly notice that a few dead bodies are strewn across the street ahead of me. I go and explore and loot the bodies and start finding more and more dead raiders - probably the ""evil super dangerous raiders"" from the quest that were successfully putting pressure on a group of armed people inside the house. The next moment I see my damn dog companion running around the corner and join me again (read: start blocking my movements again).  So long story short: the dog companion (that I didn't want in the first place) and follows me around (while always getting in my way and blocking my movements) has suddenly gone AWOL while I was looting the town and single-handedly defeated a group of armed raiders that were strong enough to suppress a group of 4 or 5 armed people. So basically the game played itself. The game is so terribly designed that you don't even need to play the game to progress. Seemingly the target demographic that Bethesda chose has such a low IQ that they literally had to add a ""faceroll"" mode where user input is totally irrelevant and you simply win by default. So in future I'll simply walk into a new area with my invulnerable dog companion, go to the bathroom for a good dump and then come back and loot (probably I'll feel less dirty after playing wit the contents of the toilet after taking my dump then after giving my money to a company like Bethesda). And that's basically Bethesdas idea of a great RPG game.  One word for you Bethesda quacks: refund. Oh, and please go DIAF.… Expand "

Poor optimization in addition to a 30fps lock make for a painful experience for anybody who is used to playing the likes of Fallout 3/NV on PC.  This is in addition to the game's speed being locked to the framerate, which is an issue a seasoned developer like Bethesda should not have, and let's not forget the fov, which is borked beyond belief.  While in previous games the fov could be adjusted properly through the use of the console this game's attempt at simulating that is poorly implemented at best.  This, coupled with a game that touts 'total freedom' yet yanks on your chain for straying from the pre-determined path out of fear you'll get bored and or frustrated and you've got a game that meets only the bare minimum of what we'd consider an RPG.  A dialogue wheel that is incredibly vague at best is key to shattering my immersion every time I get into a conversation, and NPCs who, in addition to being immortal, once again restricting my choice as a roleplayer, are poorly voice acted/animated and badly written.  None of the dialogue choices I make come out the way I want, and I feel like the voiced PC was implemented less to be an immersive and interesting feature and more to cover up the railroading the game forces you down to give you it's 'emotional' and 'intense' plot.  Which, though I won't spoil, is hilariously poorly implemented and just flat out cliche.  The game has potential to do interesting things with it's quests and story, but scrapes the bottom of the barrel, both boring the player who is interested in that sort of thing and shattering previously established Fallout lore in the process.  The only positive I can really give the game is that the shooting is better, but even then, this is meant to be an RPG, not an FPS.  The guns are still hilariously weak sounding and not terribly fun to use, even when fully customized.

The new construction system doesn't ""just work"" as advertised and is actually really buggy and annoying. Fences are stuck to going awkward directions that never work, structures don't snap to 90 degrees and are impossible to get right. Scrapping materials seems like a waste of a lot of time. Providing for the people in the settlements is tedious and unrewarding. Basically everything about it is disappointing.  Gameplay is the worst of any modern shooter.  I know VATS is pushed heavily, but it seems weird that the game never introduces it in any way shape or form. Also, VATS now slows down time instead of stopping it, ridding of the series turn based roots, though actually one of the few changes I enjoy. Overall combat is terrible and seems like just another obstacle in every quest rather than creating an experience. With modern games such as the Witcher (I know I've already mentioned it) making combat into something that is really unique and challenging, Fallout ops instead to make it boring and almost unusable.  Graphics in the game look like Skyrim with some extra lighting and slightly improved textures. In fact, modded Skyrim is far better looking than Fallout 4 on ultra.

Having playing Every fallout so far, yes even tactics and BOS and having the collectors edition of New Vegas and Fallout 3 I feel I can safely say I am a fan of the series.  So, lets start off where I started off. Launch the game, stuck to the left ""wing"" dispaly of my triple 23's. No matter what I tried I was unable to move it center screen, nor was I able to find a 5760X1080 option. I disable eyefinity start over.  Character creation, done, FOV looks off and FPS isnt that great despite my I7 4770K, R9 390X and 16 gb ram wiht FO4 on a SSD, I got all the bases covered here. Ttalk to ""vault guy"" game CTD, restart, CTD again when swapping to female character. Start game, locks up and I have to force close with task manager several times. End up verifying game with steam and it fixes it.  Get to pick special stats, only 21 points instead of normal 39 from Fallout 3 and NV 1 and 2. Really? So you can have a balanced start of all 4s? On the games own scale of 1-10 a 4 is below average.  Try to change FOV with ini tweaks since the game doesn't have a FOV slider and Bethesda thought 75ish FOV would be swell but it doesn't stick and keeps reverting.  Finally get to Vault 111, and here is where the story is already falling apart, your spouse is killed and your son is taken. Who cares about an NPC we have known for all of 15 minutes? Zero motivation to care about the story.  Terrible FPS drops inside and outside. Power armor is now a limited use thing powered by fuel cells. Dialog wheel is complete trash. Mostly the four options are, yes, no, maybe and ""sarcastic"". Once you advance dialog you cant go back to ask other questions. PC UI is troublesome to navigate and the keybinds are horrendous. Especially for the base building and conversation selection. Voice acting is flat and lines are often repeated over and over. Graphics are sub par for a 2015 game.  Its not all bad, the new weapon and armor customization are neat, power armor customization  is pretty good and while flawed controls hinder the base building its still a nice adaptation from the modders work on earlier titles. Power armor hud is pretty slick, but mods for NV/3 do it better.  Gun play is vastly better now, but the AI isnt much better than what we seen in Skyrim already, especially apparent in stealth despite making loads of noise kicking stuff around when moving.… Expand "

I've heard it all, from the ""the reason Skyrim has 60 companions and Fallout 4 has 12 is because Bethesda wanted to make them unique"" to the ""Bethesda using last gen assets from an 8 year old game is perfectly acceptable because it speed up development time"". But none of these excuse bethesda's laziness. After all they are a multi billion dollar company, with development teams bigger than most industry leading companies out there, it is a shame that a  triple A company with 4 consecutive game of the year awards and a budget so large it would put most triple A games to bed releases yet another unfinished product to the market.  Glitches: The game has countless problems, from AI path-finding glitches, falling through the ground, areas not loading properly, constant freezes (specially on consoles), re-used animations from skyrim and Fallout 3, the list goes on. Like many reviewers (who GAVE IT A 10/10) POINTED out, it is a Bethesda game, and they still haven't figured a way to release a properly working game. How can someone admit that the game is unplayable at times yet give it a 10/10 is beyond me *cash in sound plays in the background*.  The player model often finds itself stuck around the world, from invisible walls (the countless videos about it on the internet) to not being able to pass through areas because there's a small rock on the ground obstructing it's path.  Story: It's more of the same, Bethesda has this ability to make interesting stories, that are only good on concept. I enjoyed it at times, but when you have games like Witcher 3 in which most side quests affect the world around you and the main quest has a lot of diverging paths that will ultimately affect the outcome of the story, playing fallout, despite being an open world, feel like an scripted experience.  Graphics: It's laughably ugly. From armors not being fully 3d rendered, with the majority (80%) of details being illusions caused by normals/bumpmaps generated from baking much much higher poly meshes. Even the shirt sleeve tears are not rendered this time, they are hand drawn (actual meshes) to avoid using high quality texture work with proper alpha channels. It's an ugly technique that makes things such as ripped cloth look like a lego set piece. Shadows stop being rendered 5 meters way from you. LOD is reduced to a minimum, even on max settings on PC so that the engine can keep itself from CTD.  Gameplay: In short, It's better than fallout 3. Shooting mechanics actually have feel to them now, there is actual recoil to some weapons. Enemies drop like flies, disembodiment looks great... the hit detection has been improved. The vats system is as great as Fallout 3. The gameplay is definitely the highest point in the series, but it's not enough to justify everything else that's going on.  Will you like this game? Depends, are you the type of person who blindly wastes your money on DLC, micro-transactions and browser games with bait pictures of hot females? Do you have nothing else better to play? Are you a Fallout die-hard who will threaten people with decapitation over observable facts? Then this is the game for you.  For the rest of us. No, Wait for the game to be patched, DLCs to come out and it to drop in price. This game is not worth 70 bucks.… Expand "

Most important, Bethesda has focused heavily on things I could not care less about (first-person shooting, graphics, this weird settlement-building game, voice acting, min-games) and left out what matters.  What I love about New Vegas is how you feel immediately immersed in the story and can write it however you want.  You feel in control, as if your choices matter.  With Fallout 4, I felt like I was playing someone else's story, able to make some choices, but ultimately just playing a First-Person Shooter game with some RPG elements tossed in for fun.

SMIICE,"Nov 13, 2015",1," So here is the review after playing for 28 hours.  Let’s start and say Fallout and Fallout 2 was and will be my favorite games of all time (now I can add Witcher 3 to that list)    I did not like Fallout 3 for lack of being Fallout and being Oblivion with guns, but I enjoyed Fallout New Vegas a lot.    I love TES series, but it’s not TES series we will be talking about here.    CharacterSo here is the review after playing for 28 hours.  Let’s start and say Fallout and Fallout 2 was and will be my favorite games of all time (now I can add Witcher 3 to that list)  I did not like Fallout 3 for lack of being Fallout and being Oblivion with guns, but I enjoyed Fallout New Vegas a lot.  I love TES series, but it’s not TES series we will be talking about here.  Character System:  We don’t have skill anymore just perks. The SPECIAL system became even more casual then Fallout 3.  Combat:  It not interesting and very outdated. Combat stopped being tactical. Super mutants don’t feel threatening at all. I play on hard.  Dialogue system:  There is no need to invest points into speech (there is not speech skill). Dialogue has only 4 options. 1)	Yes 2)	No 3)	Question? 4)	Sarcasm  There is no writing involved. Dialogues are not fun. You dot need to use your brain at all. I like to hear my name in the game that was a nice touch.  Quests:  Side quest are go fetch that item and go kill everyone at the specified location. To join the BOS in the first game it was so hard but afterword’s it felt amazing. Completing side quest without killing anyone (never happened so far and I played 28 hours).  There is a quest where it feels like there should be a peaceful solution, but there is none you should kill one side or the other. There is no third option in this game.  Equipment:  I like how power armor is designed in Fallout 4. But it stopped being special it need no skill. Everyone can use it. You can find it everywhere. Good thing all equipment is customizable (I like it a lot).  Building:  I don’t like micromanagement part at all. I would love to have the ability to gather resources and tell settler to build walls and everything else. At least have that option in addition to Farmville simulator. It’s not Sims it is fallout. Upgrading settlement is a great concept but very poorly implemented.  Graphics:  Graphics is not an issue for me since I like Fallout 2. I do have GTX 980TI and the rest of the good components so I would have appreciated having better graphics and physics like Witcher 3.  Recycling old engine is just so... have no words but lazy and greedy.  If was Bethesda I would be ashamed to release such product.    Bugs:    Never ending glitches. This game has 10’s of it. But it's ok, I don’t mind. All bugs can be fixed.    Open world:    Need to load game every time I enter a large building if super annoying for me and game breaking.  I’m tired of never-ending loading screens.  Gameworld is so small I would have been ok if there was something to do besides:  * Killing everything  * Retrieving objects and  * do Minecraft things.    Verdict:    If you like Minecraft and FPS, in general, this is definitely game for you and must buy and most probably the game of the generation.    If you like true RPG experience and you fan of fallout universe please stay away and don’t make the mistake like I did.    Bethesda destroyed Fallout series with Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, thank god there was Fallout New Vegas (thank you Obsidian for that).

Pros: + cities and some buildings are now part of the world (not separate locations which must be loaded after entering the door); +  Morrowind-like armour sets where you need to collect pieces of armour for both left and right hand/leg;  Cons: - Completely retarded ""RPG"" part of the game: no skills, useless and dumb perks, 1 point/perk per level. Intelligence does not affect anything. SPECIAL attributes (just like books) became another kind of perks. As the result you cannot increase any ability at the beginning of the game (for instance in previous games you could invest all initial points in lock-picking at the beginning and be able to open advanced locks). - There is NO dialogues. Because the communication in this game cannot be named a dialogue. Forget about speech skill, forget about numerous dialogue options and skill checks. Here you will only see: ""Yes"", ""No"", ""What do I need to do?"" and ""Sarcastic"". In Arroyo (Fallout 2 first location) you have more dialogue options and side quests than in Fallout 4 after 3 hours of game-play. - Awful map. World map can be useful sometimes but local area map is just a joke. - VATS just slows down the time i.e. you must act quickly because moving targets will dynamically update your hit chances. For me its bad because now there is no tactics involved in the process: you must mindlessly shoot targets. - As some people already reported: power armour, death claw and machine gun after 1 hour of gameplay. - Game was made with console-kids in mind and as a result everything is simplified and not user-friendly for PC users. - Immortal NPCs. I remember, in Morrowind there are couple of quest-related NPCs that cannot be killed. But here almost all of them (that have names) cannot be killed. Forget about ""run and kill 'em all"". - No karma. Your actions do not have any effect. - Stupid story line. ""They took my kid, I must revenge"" DFQ is this Bathesda? - Music. Well, they mostly just took songs from Fallout 3 and that's all.  Conclusion: This is no a RPG you waited (if you have been waiting for Fallout). Its not a bad game, but it is not a RPG. It is just a good shooter with immortal dog that follows you while you are shooting. Probably will start playing Fallout 2 again today...… Expand "

drone_fo,"Nov 10, 2015",4," SPECIAL role system is so simplified that it is not nearly role-playing system anymore (no distinguishable skills/perks, everything is a set of base perks that you get to upgrade each level - including SPECIAL attributes themselves - one point per level), looks more like shooter with perks (see e.g. Wolfenstein: New Order).

It is struggling to get used to all the different keys used to fly through different menus. Plus sometimes mouse over doesn't work properly. Stuff like you comparison to your current weapon is very informative (like ++/-- instead of showing real values), and this applies not only to the inventory but also for crafting. Dog steals kills from you. Quests are poorly written, very typical bravado/cliches. Graphics is outdated, however animations seem fixed at last, better facial animation and some modern stuff like Physically Based Shading seems present. However, guns updating looks quite interesting, village building/maintaining looks a bit interesting too, but in my opinion, completely out of place.… Expand "

By doing this they have shown EA that they are ripe for picking and soon it might read something like ""Bethesda Soft Works, A Division of EA"". You know what, if EA acquires Bethesda, the quality of their games might actually improve (not just polishing of their finished products)  All the negative reviews here actually give the underlying reasons for such a review...but almost 90% of the positive (9+/10 score reviews) don't list down the positives of the game but only bash the criticism dished out by the fallout fans and experienced RPG players. IMHO, all those positive reviews are done by 'PAID SHILLS'  Fallout 4 looks like it was conceived by the foursome of Borderlands, RAGE, TES 5:Skyrim and Minecraft. All the good work put in by Obsidian in FO:NV has been stripped off to show the ugly inside of Bethesda's consolization of the game. a BIG middle finger to Obsidian and the fallout fans and a finger pointing towards the pockets of the console gamers ""More moolah....because we spent million on creating 'The Hype'!"".  *Wooooooosa....WOOOOOOOSSSA....calm down!*  I got my first shock on the indifferent emotional state of the Protagonist when he/she lost a family member ""oh! I'm going to avenge you!"" that's it?? this is how people behave when they lose a loved one? Geez! Facial expressions and lip sync is so 2005. Can't say much about the story but the initial side-quests are mostly go fetch or kill tasks.  A person who just came out of a 210+ years of Cryo-slumber starts using energy weapons, power armors as if using a butter knife for breakfast or putting on clothes for work. Starts modding equipment as if he was the greatest blacksmith the world has ever known. who needs training for all that? heck! they should have atleast made the protagonist upload training disks to his mind like Neo did in Matrix.,,,it wouldn't have seemed as inappropriate.  Ok! I get it! the PC doesn't need training, he was born trained....but WE do need tutorials for Bethesda's version of Minecraft.

You are railroaded in an uninteresting world where 30% of the enemies are zombies (they're not feral ghouls anymore, they are just zombies), 30% of the enemies are raiders, 20% of the enemies are Super Mutants. 10% of the enemies are Mole-Rats with different skins, 5% are Deathclaws and the other 5% are Bloatflies with different skins. It is an open-world game where there is only one city.  First thing I did after leaving the Vault was meeting Codsworth, who was immortal, and it sent me to the Concord. In the way I met Dogmeat who was also immortal and was forced upon me. I choose the option ""You're a mutt"" and all my character said was ""You're just a flea-bag, huh? Let's go, boy"". And then Dogmeat was forced on me, but I still could send it away. The thing is that even after being sent away I still couldn't kill it because Dogmeat is immortal.  Then I met Preston, I killed all the raiders easily despite being in Survival Mode because the AI is very, very dumb. I said no to helping Preston but I still got the same quest as if I said yes. Then I tried killing them and guess what? Each one of them is immortal. So I got out and got the Power Armor. Then I killed every raider easily, then the Deathclaw came and got stuck in the sewer where it came from. Despite being in Survival mode, the Deathclaw died easily.  That's when I decided to quit the game. But I got back to it after a while and went exploring instead of doing quests. The world was empty.

Though I suppose that can be forgiven, given the distance)  Overall a mediocre title that doesn't live up to the hype, out of all the things I've said, the real nail in the coffin is just how boring the game manages to be.

The main quest isn't very interesting (I won't spoil anything for you), for a fallout game I was expecting something epic that wasn't ""predictable"" and that kept me hooked the entire time, and that wasn't the case at all, I found myself a lot of the time pushing myself to complete certain objectives. It drags on waaaay too much without giving you any satisfaction in the end like it should. You'll feel like you've been grinding so much for nothing.  On the other hand, the side quests are vast and lets you choose the path you want to take, however the choice system isn't very deep and it always ends up with positive, negative and neutral responses which many times leaves you unsatisfied for something that always were a big complex part of fallout, which made it great. To sum it up, it doesn't give you much to read, instead you hear it. Which is not necessarily bad but it makes it tedious at times when you don't know exactly how your character is going to express him/herself. Which for a fallout game isn't a very in depth system and breaks the immersion a lot. Still, the side quests end up being far more interesting than the main story itself.  The down side with the quests is the bugs/glitches. Yup, you heard me, it's Fallout New vegas all over again (before the patches) where 1 in each 4/5 quests have very annoying and sometimes BREAKING bugs that will make you go insane for not being able to complete them. Not to talk about all the crashes where some of them can even corrupt the save files. So save often to avoid bitter situations.  The graphics of the game are nothing S.P.E.C.I.A.L on ultra at 1080p. Don't get me wrong, I like FO graphics the way they are (on ultra) because I'm not very picky about it, but comparing to other titles out there already, it's very outdated...  This is where things get complicated.. because the game is poorly optimized, even on consoles where you get 30 fps (not acceptable at this point) and in some areas 25... expect A LOT of random bugs on the map and CRASHES. The game looks WORSE than fallout 3 (a game that came out almost 8 years ago) on low and medium graphics. The thing is the graphics on low and medium are LITERALLY broken on the minimum specs, especially with the shadows and textures out of place. which is just unacceptable and it will need some patches to fix that. The lock fps being a problem too.  Gameplay, it's similar to the other (3D) previously titles, nothing especial but it works, it has more animations and a fluid gameplay if you can run it on high with no problems, otherwise be prepared for stutters frequently.  All that said, this game needs a lot of work. It wasn't properly tested and now it needs some serious patches to fix this mess. It's not impressive for a Fallout game and it drags a lot of the quests way too much, kinda like MGSV. Satisfying,neat gameplay, with more animations and an innovative vats system that slows time instead of just freezing it. Good, fun and solid crafting system where you'll spend hours on it. One of the best I've seen. About the lvl up system, it's different but not necessarily better. Just... different. And I personally preferred the old one, it was more closely-knit. It's still worth playing, but it will only be worth buying once it gets properly fixed. However old fallout fans will be disappointing with this one.  This game would be a solid 7.5, but dull main quest, some broken secondary quests and crashes (even on consoles!) are just unacceptable at this point. No game is perfect, but this is way too much, and it's not the first time happening either. So for that it gets a 6 out of 10 for releasing an untested, poorly optimized and badly polished game to the public.  Edit: I tried, I really did. But after playing some more time I can now say that this isn't a game, it's an abomination! I've never seen such a grinding game in my entire life, it's so bad and the BUGS/GLITCHES aren't helping at all. Let alone the CRASHES. I was generous with the 6 before, after some more hours in it and getting as far as the game to be truly unplayable, this alpha V0(zero) game gets a 0.… Expand "

We were promised none less but new Fallout 2  Starcraft  Baldurs Gate  Dark Souls, but from user reviews one can clearly see it was faaaar from truth.  Far from truth in all directions:  Graphics: We were promised graphics at least on par with The Witcher 3 level. Graphics is good, really, but comparing to Witcher? Nope, not even close. I can compare Fallout to Wolfenstein or Bioshock – 1-2 years old games – good graphics, but nothing more, although humongous system requirements trying to convince us otherwise. I even bought new videocard – and for what?  Plot: This is the weakest point. After 10 hours of gameplay I completed only several dull quests. Protagonist is completely emotionless. He comes out on the surface with face like “ok, nuclear explosion, sh*t happends”. The game didn’t tell who are those people, how did they survive, where did they came from. You don’t live with your character, it is like you are playing Counter-Strike. But this is Fallout after all! Remember those quests lines from Fallout 2? I could feel the world is living there and my character lived in that world. Now I cannot understand why, what for, where …  Gameplay: I don’t like the games when you need to create your own story. Take Bioshock Infinite for example – playing the game is like you are watching awesome action movie, every second something happens. In Fallout things are like this – you want to get fun? Ok, take hundred of house patterns, take walls, doors, bath tubes and flowes – and make your own home! Go and find some fun for yourself! Probably this is the core of sandbox – maybe I just don’t like sandbox games.  Controls: This is just bad console port, controls are very bad, you can cancel some menus with ESC, but some only with TAB and this is really painful to remember HOW TO CLOSE EACH MENU – like wtf?! Why I cant cancel it all with ESC?  Crafting system: For those who like The Sims probably it can be fun, although I have doubts Sims fans will play Fallout games. You can salvage everything – very “realistic” indeed.  So what did we get? Another Skyrim in post-apocalyptic world with guns instead of magic. Skyrim was great (with better plot btw), but why make second one?  You know, the best game of all Fallout series for me was Fallout Tactics, and you know why? Because the game had its story. You have had clear course of all missions, you knew that in the end of this map new gauss gun awaits you, while F4 presents with another rusted coffee cup in the end of the long cave. The only fun moment so far was in the beginning – the nuclear explosion is really well made – I could almost feel it on my skin, and share those people horror.

But it turned outUser rating of 6 or lower is exactly what I expected to see on Metacritic. It was obvious that the game would be slightly worse than average even before its release because specific developers’ behavior (they fell over backwards just to spread how awesome their game is, simultaneously concealing every aspect of the game they didn’t want to become clear) and user streams. But it turned out that it’s even worse than that. So, what we have is:  - Trite and boring plot (if you object that it is a typical feature of Bethesda’s sandbox games and that the side quests are more important,  look at point 4). What we have is yet another detective story and father-son collision, but now inside out. Apparently, they couldn’t come up with anything more interesting. Plus multitude of irrational moments all around. - Incredibly stupid AI. NPC can head to specific point on the map completely ignoring various obstacles on their way, e.g. they can run towards the car or the fallen log, being unable to walk around it. Your companion are immortal for one and only reason - otherwise they would die every 5 minutes. Whether it is dogmeat or human ally, their movements are so chaotic that they often expose selves to danger unless you give them specific commands. e.g. human ally can walk right up to super mutant with a pistol. And that’s the most evident case. There are plenty of no less odd situations, e.g. when raiders try to shoot you up with all they have and then just randomly loose interest saying smth like «it’s just my imagination». That stupid AI behavior is  inexcusable for an AAA title in 2015. - Cropped dialogues. They were too lazy even to write the complete answers, instead we have short phrases live «yes/no/maybe» and often they’re not what we think they mean. - Tiny world. There is a video where player cross the map diagonally in 11 minutes. In GTA V it takes you 2h10m to do the same. Wide open world with many places of interest and random encounters is the main feature of Bethesda’s games and they failed even here. - And last but non the least in the game engine - graphics/animations/physics. These are miserable. Textures are terribly blurry even on ultra, animations does’t seem to be different from 2008 and physical interaction with objects is big explosions at its best. It wouldn’t be a thing to care about if it didn’t take THAT much of system resources. Even with a GTX 980 you’ll often face 30fps on ultra. Not to mention PS4 version drops to 15fps when scoped in. The reason for that outdated graphics and inadequate system requirements is the fact that developers don’t give a **** about it. They didn’t bother about making a new engine because they knew that FO4 will sell great even if it’s peace of crap. That’s why they were so obsessed with banning every single stream and leak.  Keeping all this in mind I want to ask Bethesda, maybe it was beyond your power to make a modern 3d action/rpg? At the same time you weren’t able to to make a decent story. So what are the strong sides of your game? To be honest, I grudge spending time to find them and I doubt I will. Stay away from this overhyped mess.… Expand "

I'm reviewing the PC version, but the consoles are even worse - both locked at 30 FPS with frequent dips into the teens, or worse, seconds-long hang ups and load times that seem to go on forever.  At least I'm getting 60+ FPS at all times on 1440p, maxed out, with ""minimal"" load times.  Since I'm stuck with this game now, I did try to play it further, and holy crap, what a weird experience.  The characters have zero, well, character! The voice acting is full of pizazz, and the NPCs just stand there, lifeless by comparison, as their game models barely try to approximate facial expressions, let alone matching the words with their mouths.  This game makes L.A. Noire's face tech look like it's from the **** future.  This game makes Witcher 3's dialogue cutscenes look better than real life.  And speaking of dialogue, I hope you don't like knowing exactly what you're going to say, as Bethesda has dumbed down another critical RPG feature and replaced it with vague choices that DO NOT correspond to what your character will say.

The game is a departure from the right direction New Vegas carved out of Bethesda bugs and base material. Has to be said that the game is basically Fallout 3 remix in a different region, with most story assets, ideas reused.  It doesn't have a good dialog system, the radial wheel has been simplified further from Mass Effect's Investigate + options to just options. The voiced protagonists are cringe-inducingly overacted, while still feeling dead most of the time. You do not roleplay anymore, your choices are voiced by previously mentioned VAs. The paraphrasing does not contain even slight hints about what will actually be said, on par with [GLASS HIM] from Wolf Among us. Wasting money on voiceacting and recording popular names instead of fleshing out a good dialog system with multiple choices is a huge disappointment for any fan of the previous installments. Skills were completely removed in favor of simplified perks, which makes the dialog system suffer too.  Without any spoilers, the story is reused from Fallout 3, with the roles being somewhat reversed. You are the father instead of the kid right now, we know this from the trailers too, no spoilers there.  On PC, the game suffers from extreme FPS dips in certain moments or locations, it can't keep consistent performance and framerate on a decent computer build.  Overall, the graphics are intolerable, worse than Fallout 3 at points. Turning on ultra high is almost invisible to low graphics. Everything looks like shiny plastic clay. Because of the horrid FPS dips, a framerate lock was put in place, as the case with F3 and Skyrim - mostly because of console limitations. However, looking further upon it seems to indicate that Bethesda is just overall not optimizing anything, and don't know how to decently program physics, or the like. The physics are tied to the framelock, increasing it to 60 fps can make physics behave more wonky and less sensible than it was before. The cars start magically floating sometimes.  The face sculpting system sounds okay on paper, however, the new system without scales or bars is impossible to craft perfection with. You must rely on even more gametime to make a tolerable looking face, and since you have two different characters(again, no roleplaying just roles to assume ala Call of Duty, which is not an rpg in any strict sense, or otherwise), double that amount.  The game overall suffers from the Skyrim streamlining syndrome, removing a lot of things that Bethesda couldn't make working on a 10-15 year old engine (no matter the renaming, it's the same old outdated engine, patching can only take you so far.). A popular phrase is, if you will, ""Skyrim with guns.""  The oversimplification is hurting the franchise more than it helps it. Horrible.  The only saving prospect/outlook is the very minor possibility Obsidian does a New Vegas-like separate game, reintroduces what the porting to Skyrim base assets has caused (removal and streamlining of a lot of things), and abandons everything bad 4 has brought to the series.  Bethesda should sell the Fallout IP to some company who's competent enough to make good games again. 3 out of 10.… Expand "

The dialogue wheel was one of the earliest mistakes we saw with this game. It dumbs down the dialogue to an intense degree. Less dialogue choices, and it is used many times to deceptively create an illusion of choice, when all choices are the same because you are forced into one type of character, having no leeway on how you want to be. There are even sometimes where you get four choices that are all no, no other answer can be done. Combined with the very poor voice acting and heavily linear story that reuses some parts from Fallout 3, the narrative is atrocious. It is a step down from New Vegas, where you could actually make choices and have more than just two slightly different endings that do not depend on your actions in the game.  But what about the gunplay? Don't think you'll be having any fun in that either. VATS is even more buggy than it was before, where you can see the laser or bullet hit the person's head but no damage occurs. Heck this happens outside of VATS. Enemy and Companion AI is also as smart as a potato battery, and will frequently get stuck or glitch out. Speaking of which, there are glitches everywhere. They did not even try.  Graphically, the game is unappealing in every way. Textures are noticeably bad, and there are hardly any shadows to be seen. Everything looks like plastic. Plus they even reused assets from Skyrim and Fallout 3 (seven years ago!), including models and sounds.  All RPG elements have been dumbed down or removed. The game no longer has any skills. It's only perks and SPECIAL. Despite this, New Vegas base had more perks than this game PLUS skills. All the perks in this game are just percentage increases of stats, mostly, with a few exceptions.

I currently have 8 hours invested into the game, and I will hit 100 hours, but only because I am praying that if I force myself to play longer, the game will somehow grow on me.  Game video is laggy, and this is on a high end gamer PC.  Movement, combat, scanning the horizons, all are relatively clumsy and unresponsive compared to the experience of Bethesda's other games, causing muscle memory to demand a return to precision and alacrity of an older games.  The game is further slowed down by the main character voice overs, which require much longer cut scenes, causing frequent and overlong breaks in the game action, removing the player from the game action.  I find that voiced characters do not belong to me, but to the game writers; I am merely along for the ride.  I enjoy being the silent ventriloquist to my character, and I enjoy believing that my avatar is duplicating my emotional state - things that require my internal dialogue, and are not compatible with an external voice actor.  With the main character losing my ability to define him, I did expect the story line to improve.  But, at least for the first 8 hours I've invested into the game, story telling is nothing more than annoying missions and interactions with NPC I would rather turn my gun on than help out.  Story telling has never been a strength of a open world games, player freedom does limit creators ability to author - I accept that, but if Bethesda is going to take my character away from me, I need to get something back!  A very sorry development, which hopefully doesn't migrate to the Elder Scrolls, is dumbing down of leveling.  I hated it in DA:2 and DA:I and never thought Bethesda would blindly mimic Bioware, but they did; just as DA:I only permitted you a special ability upgrade upon leveling, so now does FO4 - are skills are gone and all you get upon leveling is a single perk.  The Commonwealth (the FO4 world) is small, by Bethesda standards and is well on its way of meeting half-way Bioware (which with DA:I is trending slowly up) in world size.  Going from Vault 11, in the upper left corner of the map, to Diamond City, which is roughly the other side of the map, took about ten minutes.  Furthermore, much of the world between those two points all looks the same, refusing to demand that I take pause and just look.  This comes as a huge disappointment, especially since I just finished the DLC Lonesome Roads, where the artwork brought stunned horror to my soul, causing me to take long timeouts to enjoy panoramas that the artistic team dreamed up.  I bought the game on DVD because I have a slow internet access.  I was okay with some partial downloading - I have done this with other games and it doesn't bother me.  But less than 30% of the game was on the DVD, which meant over 72 hours of download time.  This is unacceptable.  I don't mind an hour or two if it helps counter piracy, but 70% of the game?

What Fallout 4 is Cod with sidequests. I'm not going down the road of Bad Graphics/Low Framerate/Etc, 'cause I simply don't care; even if those details were ironed out, F4 would remain a soulless game to me; EVERYTHING about fallout was the ENDING. You would play every subquest available, recruit every possible companion to see how that would affect the wasteland after the completion of you final mission (which would occur later on in the game, not only after 10 hours of gameplay); here everything is pointless, however you finish the game nothing changes (MassEffect 3 Ending anyone?). Bethesda, you sacrificed the soul of a Fallout game for the sake of ""more than 400 hours of content""...of which 390 of them can be summarized as: - From here, go there, kill everyone -v2, kill everyone and bring back item X -Defend settlement Y of useless NPCs  And the dialogues? Are you kidding me? The four option dialogue is clearly an help to all Xbox/PS players out there (which I think Bethesda judges as 4-years old with a pad in their hands, given the oversemplifications they've made): options are basically Yes-No-Sarcastic-Info. That's it. I expect this level of oversemplification for a FPS, not from an RPG.  And the NPCs? There is no-one (except maybe for Hancock, which I found the less boring one) that really sticks with you...no-one that really makes you think about their story, no-one that really feels interesting (you had so much potential, just think of Fawkes, Sarah Lyons, Three Dog, Moira Brown of F3, and Tabitha, TheKing, Cesar, the Boomers, the entiry questlines for the WhiteGloves, Lonesome road and BigM. from FNW). I think this game is a major setback from NW, which exploited the weirdness of the mojave wasteland to create a unique story...here there is absolutely nothing of that atmosphere. And what about the perks? Guys, with NW you had a perfectly fine game that just need a tune-up with better graphics and maybe a new engine. That'is. Not a streamlined story with multiple pointless and identical subquests, that feel boring just after playing it for a couple of days. PLEASE, producers out there, stop creating abominable ports of games that should be masterpieces, and instead end up crappy for the sake of ""having people on console enjoy them too"".  And also, ""Professional"" Reviewers, how in good conscience can you give a game like this a 80+ score? Have you ever played an RPG before? Do you know what its strong points are (or should be)?

Comparing Fallout 3 or NV is impossible becouse they are totally different games at this point, in fact they get rid of some of their best mechanics that some might argue that they were not up to their taste (like karma, yeah we got no karma now, most of the story flagged npc cant' be killed and we got no mechanic to compensate) I'm a player that play the game for a sense of immersion, if i wanted a shooter or an hack and slash there are way better games, most of fallout players love the lore, and not a rushed beginning, of like 5 minutes, we were supposed to see a glimpse of world before the war, but the begin was just too rushed to make people grab pipe guns and pew pew from the start. Tradeskill conversation (becouse yeah, the new voiced dialogue with absolutely no understanding of what the dude or the chick will say is such a step forward) are removed, we got a perk style now similiar like skyrim, and we miss a lot of those small things that make a game worth it, most ignore them, but playing new vegas and hearing the comment of the old man about my start allocation was cute almost as the challange of building an high educated character with low combat skill just to have charisma and tradeskill options, ""To see"" where the game would react to the character. To conclude Fallout 4 is the son that came out wrong when you mix a shooter with minecraft elements and a bit of mass effect 3 magic, ""pun intended.""… Expand "

There are too many of these thinly disguised ""quests"" that are just radiant go here, kill everything, repeating ad nausem trash quests for EVERY single damn faction in the game. This is not good game design. This is just bottom barrel scratching for something. -The dialogue system is completely trash with very little depth, frustrating ""wheel"" that doesn't explain what you're going to say, or what saying that will do to the conversation and ultimately leads you down the same linear pathway regardless. -The story is not interesting. -The settlement building mechanics and settlement happiness in relation to shops, defence, resources, etc. and settlement design could have had way better explaining. It's basically one giant mystery requiring exiting the game and seeing how someone else figured out how to get to 100 happiness, because it is not obvious at all what you are doing wrong. -Preston STFU stop giving me quests. Worst. Mechanic. Ever.  Postives: -There are a lot of really cool designed places to explore, and the variety is really really good. Sadly despite all these brilliant places, with interesting tidbits and reasons for existing the actual stuff that you need to accomplish in these places boils down to the same repetitive radiant quest frustrations and ultimately boredom. If you designed any of the artwork, or levels, or world building in this game then you should truly be celebrated. But sadly the vision is not supported by gameplay, by sound, by RPG mechanics, by story, or by anything and the cracks show throughout and it all falls apart.… Expand "
BPoole,"Nov 10, 2015",1, Where to begin? Beth has put a great many of us Fallout fans down with Fallout 4. The game is not living up to my expectations of a Fallout game. 6 hours and I just can seem to have fun. The radial dialogue wheel is a disaster. The story seems lacking and it just doesn't feel as good as Fallout: New Vegas. Immortal Dogmeat is stupid.  Rate 1 and feels like I lost $60. DISAPPOINTED in Beth.

Professional critics rate it above 8/10 all across the board. How can you explain this disparity? Are professional critics just a branch of PR arm for these game companies? Or is the game truly that good? If you check the scores of Fallout 3 and New Vegas ratings they are rated in the 8/10 by regular users – players like myself. That’s a great score. Both critics and gamers agree here. Perhaps Fallout 3 and NV are not as good as the old Fallout classics of 1 and 2, but they are very much enjoyable. And it reflects in the rating scores. Obviously I have bought Fallout 4 already, being a fan of the series, but this time I was eager to see for myself whether these bad ratings had any weight to them. Unfortunately after playing the game I have to agree with most of the heavy criticism I’ve seen so far.  And I say unfortunately because this is Fallout, a game you really hope and want to enjoy. I am sorry to say that it's a disaster on so many levels. The worst part of the game has got to be the story, writing and dialogue. You have got to be kidding. Are people this brain dead in this day and age? The player gets to choose his dialog responses, just like in the old Fallout titles, expect that your responses are trivialized to simple “YES” and “NO” type of answers. Remember all the cool dialog options you could pick in the previous Fallout games with charisma or intelligence modifiers? Well, it's all gone. The whole RPG aspect is gone as well. Skills – removed. One has to admit that with such a degree of dumbing down this is nothing more than a brain dead shooter. This is not what Fallout is supposed to be about. I can only fit a few flaws here which, in my opinion, blows Fallout 4 apart.  • Certain aspect ratios of monitors don‘t work. I had the option to use a widescreen monitor, but instead after a few hours of digging and modding I was able to play it on a 5:4 monitor.  • Many un-killable NPC‘s. You don‘t have the option to kill these people, even if it‘s for the sake of having little bit of fun. Yes, you wouldn’t be able to complete certain quests or even the main story, but that’s what the LOAD save game is for if you change your mind about the massacre you unleashed.  • Full of game breaking bugs. Getting stuck all over the place, crashing. Stealth bugs; lock picking bugs; terminals bugs. You name it.  • Abysmal story, writing and dialogue. The things you say don't have any real impact at all. All you get to choose is “Yes”, “No”, “Sarcasm” type of responses. Hell, is it really necessary to point out that a certain response might be sarcastic? I've seen this trend lately in popular culture. Are people this stupid in this day and age? It's a simple concept. If you point out that something is sarcastic in advance, it kind of defeats the whole purpose of sarcasm! It’s not funny or witty anymore. On top of that the game doesn’t really tell you whether these “sarcastic” responses are painted in negative or positive colors. Not that it matters. The story is totally streamlined and makes no difference which response you pick.  • No Karma system. The world doesn’t care whether you are good or evil. You can’t build your character around that either.  • You get power armor and a minigun 5 minutes into the game. “I get this stuff already?"" - asked myself. What the hell am I going to do later on? I don't deserve to get that, because I didn't actually do anything just yet. I didn’t feel like using those items afterwards. In the previous Fallout games you had to work for the cool and powerful stuff.  • Fallout 4 lacks the RPG elements of previous Fallout games. The game ages quickly after what seems to be a cool intro and a good start. You mostly just shoot stuff.  • The graphics aren't good for a game in the year 2015. I don’t really mind that too much, but they are still using the same old engine, which also comes with many of the same old problems. The real issue here is the performance, which is my point.  • The performance in this game is horrendous. And it’s not just me. I'm running a great rig with a GTX970. I had and still have serious FPS problems, as many people do with even better machines. The only thing that helped was doing some heavy modding (getting old now). Maybe Bethesda is relying on the modders to make their game playable? Is it a way to save some money on developing costs? If there weren’t any modders, Fallout 4 would NOT even be playable.  • Skills are removed from the game. People often say it’s an “illusion” and those stats or skill points have no real impact. That’s what they did in Diablo III. Well, so what? Is the solution to remove everything entirely? It’s a mistake to remove these mechanics from a game that previously worked just fine.  • Isn’t the world a bit too small? They had many years to make this game. A few hours into the game and I had half the world covered.  How could they make it this bad? No room for positive stuff.… Expand "

Lets start off with my biggest complaint with the FO4, the dialog system. The move to one based on only four choices is stupid in that reduces the potential for roleplaying. For most conversations the only options are now Yes/No/Sarcastic. Because of only four possible choices you cannot explore alternatives (at most times) and find out more about the characters (which are boring as they aren't fleshed out), their situation and the world through talking to them. In addition to this, often these four button choices result in dialog thats not evident from what you click and making a morally grey or evil character is now not possible to roleplay due to the narrow writing. You'd think Bethesda wouldn't shoot themselves in the foot like this by mangling this core feature of the game, but they did.  Next up, the UI. There has been seven years for Bethesda to create a functioning UI and what they turned in was worse than what was given in Fallout 3. Particularly horrid is the workshop as its cumbersome to navigate, as well as the settlement interface. The Pipboy now is a smaller screen that a bit more inconvenient to navigate with submenus not being instantly clickable and getting information from it is now fiddlier.  These two glaring problems have made the game worse than Fallout 3 which is quite an achievement, and its very unlikely they'll be fixed by Bethesda. I would advise anyone to pass on this and play a heavily modded New Vegas or F3 as they are still a more rewarding experience.  Oh and I don't expect mods to fix it. Fixing the dialog system is not likely to happen and even if it does it'll expose the lack of content in the game.… Expand "

First of all,this is not an rpg in any sense,its a mediocre shooter with (light) rpg elements set in the fallout universe designed for consoles with the pc ""port"" feeling as an afterthought. Everything we loved in previous game is gone (yes,i am one of the masochists who actually enjoyed FO3), no skill system, no 100s of perks to personalize our character, no survival mode.What we get instead is a half baked building system ,a new power armor system (which is one of the few good things in this abomination imo) and (finally!) cats. The dialogue has been replaced by a choice system (namely yes no maybe sarcasm) without any effect on gameplay , not that you actually want to talk to any of the npcs,mind, everyone and everything is mind-numbingly boring without the personality and stories we were used to. Atmosphere-wise this is one of the worse games i've seen this decade, there are a ton of places to explore but you don't have any reason to (at ~12 hours in game most of which was spent hoarding junk and planting carrots i have enough stuff to build a megacity and enough weapons to invade russia) ,gone are the little stories you discovered in previous games by looking around,everything (with the notable exception of the airship) is a generic lootfest with enemies spawing out of the ether, magical mutating bosses and... i am sure you get the idea. tl;dr if you were smart enough to not preorder (unlike yours truly,i even got the season pass) stay as far away as possible and get it next Christmas on sale.… Expand "

So far the story feels bland and very average. It would have helped if Bethesda had spent more money on actual game design and less on hyping their mediocre product and coke for their board members. But hey, what can you expect from a company like Bethesda run by utter scum like Donald Trumps brother - they proved many times before that producing good games is not what they care about - they only care about profit maximization. This brings me to my last point about this abomination of a game: season passes. It's not bad enough that Bethesda releases half-arsed, unfinished, bugged-to-hell games... no... they also are so desperate for a quick buck that they try and sell you season passes for the content that any half-decent company would have included in the already steep price for the actual game. With these advanced sales of season passes they can steal your cash before actually delivering the content because even the pricks at Bethesda notice how **** the game is and know it will flop. I give the game 0 of 10. An absolute no-go. I'd recommend you to wait a year until Bethesda have finished puking out their shallow cash grabs (known otherwise as DLCs) and then download the game from a torrent site and blast through it with cheats on a rainy afternoon. Sadly the game is so **** that this would be a waste of bandwidth. The only thing I can recommend is to boycott scum like Bethesda and also look up their board members and developers so you can avoid supporting any products and companies that this human vermin are involved in in the future.… Expand "

The story/acting/dialogue/writing and everything related to that aspect of the game is utter trash. Also the radio host... cringe...  Combat and exploration is a bit better, but not much. The FPS element is quite fun at first, although you find yourself never using VATS because it's simply not needed. I definitely find the exploration to be a bit too casual, you find a lot of good stuff really early on and it kind of makes the finding/looting a powerful weapon less special (lol see what I did there).

Here you are forced to pick one of the few already carved out ways to complete your task. There are alot of NPCs which cant be killed simply because they wanted to keep things easy and cheap for them. And on top of that the world isnt responding on your actions. You just shot someone in the head and that traveler standing next to him saw you doing that? Nope, no reaction whatsoever. There is almost no impact trough your decisions.  Seriously, if you liked Fallout New Vegas then stay away from this game. Its a complete overhyped mess. At least wait several months until the modders made he game more enjoyable.… Expand "

stormbringer83,"Nov 17, 2015",3," This is Sim City: Fallout Edition. Or The Sims: Fallout Edition. Or maybe Minecraft: Fallout Edition. But this is definitely _not_ a part of the great FALLOUT series. No strong storyline, no real drama, no difficult choices, no bloody humor, but dumb dialogues and simplified skill system. Everything, that makes every Fallout game so remebering and S.P.E.C.I.A.L, is gone. It's a loss. "
pachoz,"Nov 12, 2015",0, I guess its a decent game since it seems to remind people of far cry and borderlands and people spoke highly of those games. However as a Fallout game it is Inferior in most ways compared to the previous games in the series due to the removal of just about anything that made it an rpg - now its just an open world shooter and while it's still a fun shooter game it's not the fallout I was expecting.

This is even worse in 2015 than in 2011 when you could find V.A.T.S. references in Skyrim's files.  It's your typical Bethesda gamebryo lows with the same old bugs, the same old graphics tweaked by a bunch of amateurs (modders do a better job with graphical enhancements to Morrowind), even the same old launcher and same options menus. The difference between this and Skyrim is that Skyrim managed to look good and work surprisingly well, while Fallout 4 looks, feels and plays like a garbage-bin game or an amateur Unity engine game. It's just awful. There's no reason to even launch this game. It offers nothing new, its new features are pethetically cringeworthy (sims building, Christ), mechanics are absolutely butchered down by a maniac to fit into 13 yo dorrito crowds (have you seen the ""launch party"" - it was just sad). I've never thought I will say it, but Fallout 4 manages to be worse at everything than absolutely horrendous Fallout 3 abomination was. It's really that bad. To make things even worse (!), Bethesda interns decided to feed on NV modding scene (it's really symptomatic that Bethesda behaves like Obsidian's NV never occured - they behave like a spiled brat that don't want to acknowledge they less competent than bugphiliac Obsidian studio) and tried to implement some Nevada's features. And of course they failed miserably. A bunch of modders doing stuff in their free time did more content and executed it better than hundred million budget studio. Pathetic, isn't it?  Yeah, it will be massively successfull, it sold a lot on cringeworthy teen-centred hype. As I said however, I can be midly content with its dumb metascore (people shouldn't care about it much considering that gaming media are rotten to the core at this point and only '80-like breakdown can change that) is really low (for AAA title) and will probably go lower and some people's backleash on this poor excuse of a game in user comments section is just glorious.

But even if we ignore the bugs and assume they will mostly be fixed through patches (which is a big assumption) the game itself is just simple not very good.  The graphics are absolutely out-dated, barely better than Fallout 3. The animations especially are just horrid. These are just unacceptable in 2015. The textures look like something you would expect to see in a game 6-7 years ago(when they load of course).  Of course you will have people saying ""it's not about the graphics! I only care about gameplay!"" Ok fair enough, let's talk about gameplay. First of all the controls are just terrible. Maybe this is better on consoles, but for PC users, the game doesn't control well at all. The UI in general is also a pain to use, especially when using the crafting interfaces, etc. It almost seems like they were purposely trolling with the controls in this aspect.  The gunplay is also not fun at all. Simplistic, yet frustrating would be how I describe it. Frustrating mainly because of the controls, but there just is no depth at all to the actual gameplay. Very watered-down dumbed-downed gameplay in general. Other than that you have the same basic ""open-world exploration"" gameplay that we have come to expect from every single AAA game out there it seems.  The conversation wheels are also very simplistic and uninteresting. The story itself is fairly generic and boring, but pretty much what you would expect from a Fallout game. The characters are extremely boring and make you feel absolutely nothing. I will admit that I did only play about 3 hours or so, so maybe there is a chance that this stuff (story, characters, etc.) might get better later in the game but I could not force my way through a game that was not fun at all to find out.  In conclusion let me say that yes, it may seem that I'm being too harsh on the game, and maybe to an extent that's true. But to see so many people and reviewers singing the praises of this game is baffling. The one thing that Bethesda did do well was hype the crap out of this game and I think that's why. Do yourself a favor and at the very least, wait.

RestlessGamer,"Nov 11, 2015",1,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          The sad end of an era.  I've played every Fallout and Elder Scrolls game (other than the MMO) and loved them all, despite their flaws, but I will never play another after this one.  While starting out OK, the plot and quests rapidly become boring and repetitive.  There's enough initially to get you beyond the two hour steam refund point, but the content quality drops significantly after that.  I absolutely despise being handed power armour and a mini-gun, so early in the main plot line.  In previous fallout games, being so over-powered was the point at which I started to get bored and yet here I am running around in full power armour with a level 2 character.  The loss of the skills system along with the dumbing down of the perks is just horrible to see.  Almost no faction, reputation or ethical plot consequences to your actions.  Building your own base was a great idea in principle, but implemented really badly and has no real game-play value.  Collecting resources for your installations is about as fun as clearing your garden after a big storm and is in many ways similar.  Feels tacked on and badly thought out.  Also has some of the worst and most awkward UI and control interfaces in the game.  That's not saying much since, the UI in general is terrible, with really inconsistent, clunky and obscure navigation controls all around.  Far worse than previous fallout titles.  Speech options are incredibly limited, non descriptive and affect little.  They lack the dark humour of the previous titles and it is sometimes unclear what they are intended to mean despite usually being only two or three words long. More often than not though they are literally one word, Yes/No choices.  Trading is a night-mare as item categorisation (available in previous titles) has been removed and so you're reduced to trawling through lists of hundreds of text items with only a dozen or so shown on screen at once.  Combat is laughable.  Companion combat more so.  NPC's spam grenades at you, which are really difficult to avoid and usually result in a one shot kill when you're not in power armour.  Saying that, your indestructible NPC allies will take the brunt of the punishment and leave you with nothing to do but loot the corpses, while they mop up the hordes of bad-guys.  Providing your companion hasn't become stuck in the scenery, then by the time you get to a fight, it's usually already over and you may be lucky to get a few xp from shooting the last one or two in the back while they're otherwise occupied.  Frequently, I've literally had no idea there had even been combat going on without me, until I stumbled across the corpses much later.  When you do loot corpses, there are no hints that there are more items in a dead NPCs inventory than the four or five shown in the tiny inventory overlay and so you're forced to click on the dialogue and scroll down every time to be sure you've not missed an important item.  You will have to do this hundreds of times.  Incredibly bad design.  Graphically; OK in places, but sometimes objects look like development place-holders, with really low resolutions and misaligned textures.  I'm playing on ultra high graphics settings at 4K, with the worlds most powerful dual GPU graphics card and 32GB of system memory and yet some of the objects and NPCs have textures reminiscent of the original Doom and I'm getting big frame drops in really unexpected places.  Event the power-armour has, in my opinion, low quality modelling and texturing, which is a surprise given that it is the focus of the very dull intro sequence.  All around, I feel that this is an extremely lazy and poor quality title in which Bethesda have added little and yet taken away so much.  The only good thing about it is the re-use of the earlier titles theme music and the atmospheric radio tracks.  For that it gets a 1 rather than 0.… Expand "

An RPG includes consequences for actions, dialogue trees tied to character attributes, skills, or other traits, and allows the player to hand craft a very details set of characteristics to meet what they imagine. And no single character can assume all roles in an RPG.  None of this was evident within the 19 hours of play time I've put into the game.

This is NOT Fallout -- in spirit. Sure it's in the name. Sure it has the same critter names. Sure they use the same attributes. Sure they use the term perks, but pervert its original usage. Sure it's a post apocalyptic setting with a pip-boy. That's where the significant similarities to all prior Fallout end. Note: these are superficial. The spirit of Fallout, since version 1, has been: choices have consequences, but you are free to choose as you like, even if that means being worse than raider scum. Also, not evident in this game is that ""Life finds a way"" civilization will still revive in the absence of the old (hi-tech) world.  #4. Most of the gameplay mechanics I've looked at are broken or infuriatingly unpolished. Other metacritic user reviews are a great source of the blow by blow on these -- negative and mixed. Even the ""mixed"" reviews are rather hard on the game, and deservedly so.  #5. The story is rubbish. It's trite. There is no STORY LEVEL motivation to do anything. I really don't care if the settlers live or die. In fallout 1 you started by trying to save your Vault, then were pulled into a regional conflict which you could resolve many ways, including joining ""The Master."" The MacGuffin here, in FO4, is handed to you once, and weakly alluded to in select interactions, none of which you have any choice in how to handle.  #6. The game was NOT designed to be played on a PC. The port was a mindless effort resulting in frustrating, difficult to use UI that eventually drives a person to drink.  Others with more console gaming experience here on metacritic have also voiced concerns over the UI as applied to consoles. I find this greatly concerning.  #7. The game performance, in many categories, is just horrid. Again other metacritic user reviews are a great place to get a breakdown on these details. When people with rigs that are about $1K more expensive (justifiably!) than mine, and mine is not a piece of junk by any stretch, have noticable, and cumbersome, performance issues, that says I will not be able to afford to run this game in a manner I consider acceptable. (I'm not putting $1K into my box to run a bleedin' game with a story that I don't even care about!)  #8. Item placement for settlement/home building is frustrating, and there is no in game tutorial to assist. You learn by trial and error. Many people have incorrectly claimed that you can't make a perfectly 90 degree corner. It took me about 8 hours of playing with the mechanics to figure it out.  #9 Mediocre voice acting, even the nerd at Diamond City radio. Its uninspired delivery coupled with unimaginative writing is just dull.  For these reasons above, and more, I've asked Steam, for the first time ever, for a refund.  This is not the first game I've bought and disliked. However, it is the first I've requested a refund on!  Why ask for a refund on this and not other titles that I've bought that I disliked?  The ads lied. Bethesda lied.  Largely false advertising was used to acquire our hard earned dollars for this title. Steam helped perpetrate the lie by categorizing this game as an RPG. It is not an RPG, it's a FPS game. And it is Fallout only in name and superficial theme.  How is this different from other titles I disliked?  Let's look at what were my least two favorite purchases up until this point:  Mass Effect 2 Ads for Mass Effect 2 did not lie about what it was, and unlike FO4 it has a compelling story. The mechanics and the fact that it's a piece of twitchware just drove me batty and I stopped playing.  I have watched the story as posted on youtube and absolutely love the story. I just hate playing shooters. They're not my scene. It's OK if you love them. I still won't, tho.  Wastelands 2 The ads for Wastelands 2 did not outright lie. It is a tactical RPG. It just has an awful story with juvenile writing. Oh and ALL of your rangers are jerks. It's grating. But WHEN the mechanics work it's what I wanted out of Fallout: Tactics. So it's still got some value for me.… Expand "

crazyrussian65,"Nov 13, 2015",6, Some of the graphics are plastic looking. Gameplay can get repetitive quick when you try to do other missions other than the main story. The companion mechanics are wierd... They can often blow your cover and get themselves hurt a lot. Pretty fun to build a new settlement and create some fresh guns.  so... not bad. I wouldn't pay $60 though.

The settlements, companion romances, weapon mods all seemed like interesting additions, but serve very little purpose in the game, giving little to no reward for the time invested in them.  Not only were the new additions poorly implemented, but they stripped out any of the good things they did in fallout 3. The small wasteland makes for a claustrophobic feeling sandbox, which can get over whelming when you first head into boston, which is a far cry from the anticipation that you got in fallout 3 as you headed out into the wide wasteland. Also with the removal of skills in favour of the perk system, bethesda has essentially thrown out any incentive to replay the game, and further waters down progression, where a level 40 character feels almost the same as a level one character and all the characters feel the same as every character has access to the same perks, there is no way to specialize or make an interesting character build at all. Your character will be basically identical to everyone elses.  In terms of story, it's a bit of a mess. They tried to attempt to make a more focused personal story with the voice protagonist, but end up alienating the player even more. Instead of the semi freedom that you got in the previous 2 games, your character ends up feeling railroaded into a couple of life less dialogue choices of which there are only 4 at any given time, which the player has no way to tell what the player will actually end up saying. Bethesda try and railroad the player into getting emotionally attached by having the player go after your ""son"", but it feels forced and I cared little about him as there's little reason to care. The story also deals heavily with the advanced technology of the institute, but this feels incredibly jarring and at odds with the rest of the fallout universe.  All in all, fallout 4 is a bunch of ideas the developers wanted to shove in, implemented very poorly. In the end we're left with a mishmash of gameplay features that were mostly stolen from mods that somehow did a better job than a AAA studio could produce. My recommendation would be to put off buying this game until you can get it cheap and all the DLC has been released, and the modders have fixed bethesda mess, once again.… Expand "

Entire character motivation is based around a 15 minute cutscene at the start of the game that does nothing to establish a narrative beyond rely onComplete and utter abuse of the company's cherished reputation, as was the case with ESO.

Entire character motivation is based around a 15 minute cutscene at the start of the game that does nothing to establish a narrative beyond rely on pre-established lore (which gets completely disrespected immediately after). Could not care less about my shoe-horned 'family' that im supposed to care about.  After playing for 15 hours I'm yet to find a quest that isn't 'go here, kill x and return'. Game hits a huge wall around the 10 hour mark, where you realize you've seen all the content you're getting - its just reiterations after that. Those claiming the game is decent are simply yet to hit this wall, or blinded by hype. Quest environments are predictable and linear, with little opportunity for straying from the beaten path or using character traits to explore new opportunities. 90% of scenarios are indoor, path driven experiences that only support the run-and-gun tactic.  Weapon and armor customizations are a joke, differences between customized versions are often completely arbitrary (e.g 5-10% range damage drop off improvement with NO difference in base damage between pistols and SNIPER variants). Ammunition sub-types are completely abolished, and weapon variety is hilariously small compared to previous games - coupled with above mentioned lack of impact from customization, weapons rarely feel any different.  RPG elements are completely missing, this is an FPS by anyone's standard. Only semblance of RPG is the perk system, which is boring and uninspired compared to previous games. Removal of skills TRIVIALIZES character progression and makes levelling up and making a 'build' a complete waste of time. Unless you're the type that enjoys cracking out a spreadsheet and calculating that extra two damage or ten caps you're saving because of those uninspired perks you spent hours grinding out, prepare to be very disappointed.  Progression is terrible - power armour is found an hour into the game that makes you nearly invulnerable, and you're also given a minigun and 700 rounds at the same time. Perks are separated in ranks by huge level gaps that make no sense and restrict creativity in building your character. Many rank 10 perks will require level 1 for the first rank, then level 20+ (??!?!?!?) for the second. Many of the seemingly end-game legendary items have trivially easy methods of collection, when compared to some of the massive effort you had to put in to find them in previous games.  Companions and general AI are PLAGUED with issues, from obvious things like teleporting into elevators and suddenly turning against their own factions at a moments notice, to subtle things like blocking doorways when you're under fire or walking infront of thrown grenades. Enemy AI is completely predictable and does not change at ALL regardless of difficult settings, despite promises that 'higher difficulties wont just turn enemies into sponges' during E3. Enemies will consistently hide behind cover that offers laughable protection and have no concept of how they are placed as a group (I've seen groups of five all trying to use the same doorway as cover...)  Finally, the world feels empty and barren compared to other games. You don't feel as though you're part of a living, breathing world - you just stumble into an area and everyone is immediately willing to accept this total stranger into their ranks for the most insignificant stuff. Things like being allowed into diamond city or joining the brotherhood of steel after a 30 second encounter just completely devalue the role they play in the world.  You had seven years Bethesda, what the hell. Obsidian wrote half of this **** for you, all you had to do was pretty it up and create a different looking world for us to exist in.

But I still hoped for better, I thought that fallout can never be bad, all while cautiously being reluctant to preorder it - there was that annoying feeling that something's not right if a company already wants to take your money before any presentation. Well, now we have the reason.  Fallout 4 is a game that tries very hard to be all other popular games, attempting to meet the widest range of tastes, the least average required to gather the biggest audience. As the result, ofcource, the game is average. Everything is done to smear the game like **** in a thin layer across all possible plains. There is an element of building and crafting, because minecraft is popular. There is now a voiced protagonist, because that is popular. An idiot-safe interface for console players. Ridiculously simplified core mechanics to appeal to the widest intellectual range. Because, you know, cutting a whole dimension of depth out from a game is a popular decision.  None of these changes(except for crafting) were necessary, but were done solely because trends dictate so. And while Bethesda is engulfed heads-over in that wild orgy of people-please for maximum profit, they completely impair a good game to a point where it is nothing but a shadow of its past - a mod-platform in a shell of the great legacy of Interplay.  But there is a difference between an isolated game being average, and a culmination of an amazing franchise taking a long dip face-down the pavement. A huge difference. Bright minds at Bethesda somehow fail to understand that Fallout is not just an established name - it is a brand, and a brand also bears a set of standards and achievements, which must be upheld. Otherwise there is no reason for the brand to even exist.  ""Professionals"" at Bethesda obviously are of a different opinion. This is why we get a voiced protagonist for example. Most people, including Bethesda, don't see a problem with it until they actually play the game. Well, Witcher, for example, had a voiced protagonist. Witcher is also very popular. So lets copy Witcher, amirite?  None of the them, however, consider that Fallout never was, and never should be Witcher. The difference is their approach to the RPG genre, and while Witcher is an interpretation of a written book, therefore tells the story of a predetermined character, Fallout(and Elder Scrolls aswell), on the other hand, allowed you to experience and write your own story, of YOUR adventures in the world. The character was always determined by you, you created your story, and weren't just following the tale of someone else.  The voiced protagonist worked in Witcher because it never had that level of immersion in the first place. Taking it and slamming it into Fallout isn't just limitation of the game's potential - its kitsch and mimicry of the lowest grade. The immersion, so vital for a game like Fallout, is irreparably damaged; the franchise is at it's alltime low, but hey, it's familiar to the Witcher fanbase now, so sales are guaranteed, amirite? Bethesda's followers and critics even dare to defend this under the guise of ""innovation"" - such an amateur, dimwitted argument, used handy all around by studios to hide from their unprofessional decisions. I can bash-in your Cadillac's engine and call it a new model, for the sake of justice.  The resultant dialogue wheel serves for even more player alienation from the game, now that, just like in Witcher and Mass Effect, your character frequently reacts unparallel to the meaning of your choice and your expectations. A character that has his own will is irritating, annoying and means total death to the immersion.  Instead of fixing and improving the leveling system Bethesda decided to get rid of a huge chunk of it alltogether - the skills, which were a backbone of character building, are now gone victim of simplification for the average customer. Managing skills and building your character in detail is obviously too hard to brain about. People don't need no **** choice, amirite? Idiots admire a few more perks than before, forgetting that perks are now mixed with usual skill-like traits, which therefore means both less traits and less perks.  Heck, they wanted to make the game so damn static and predictable, they even replaced normal crits with unleashable criticals(aka crits by button push) - a retardation the likes of which I have never seen before. Because who needs luck factor in a game that features a specific character trait called ""luck""... Ooops.  The plot quality, which was used as explanation for voicing the character, is unsurprisingly nothing special. Without spoilers - you have to search for a member of your family. Yes, again.  The graphics are a shame for 2015, and there is no big world to compensate for the lack of detail. Lazily done modification of an old engine.

Here is the review of old-school Fallout fan, based on completing it and spending 80+ hours trying to find any sign of Fallout in this game.  BETRAYAL I've been waiting for you for 7 years. I pre-ordered you. I upgraded my PC. I even took a vacation. And you betrayed me. You are not a Fallout game. What is the essence of Fallout world? What makes us dive into it again and again? What makes gamers play 1998 game in 2015?  I think the answer is - Wasteland atmosphere and freedom of choice. Atmosphere of destroyed by war and slowly degrading society, where word ""moral"" is long forgotten and gun is the law. Atmosphere of despair where only drugs can give you a brief relief from severe reality, if you are lucky enough to get them. Atmosphere of living, dynamic post-nuclear world. And the freedom of choice when every word, every action impacts the world. And of course countless variants of player customization via level progression. That makes these games special. Fallout 1,2, NV meet these criteria, Fallout 3 partially. But not this abomination. Wasteland feels like Wasteland no more. First of all because of new blurred cartoon-like graphics. Everything looks new, bright and polished, as if some invisible stealth cleaning guy has been wiping and waxing every damn brick in Boston for 200 years. And this polished Boston is filled up with targets. I can't call them ""enemies"" - they have no character, no history, no motivation, no ai; their only purpose is to die from your bullet. I wonder how much does Todd Howard hate Fallout so he cut all RPG from it? This game is not an RPG. You cannot choose you role, it's been predefined for you. You cannot ""do whatever you want ©"", you can't even shoot whatever you want now. But you can choose whatever face, haircut or outfit you want, isn't that great?  Linear plot is death penalty to an RPG game (they call it so, not me) . And here Bethesda beats all records. Each dialog has 4 options, but ALL lead to one (1) result. No matter what you say, it ends the same way - boring. This word can describe the whole thing. Boring. But there were pleasant surprises, couple of quests made impression of Alt-Tabbing to Fallout 3. Then idea came to my mind. I thought of ninja-designer, who sneaked into Bethesda office at night and wrote these quests, risking his life and freedom. Thank you, nameless hero.… Expand "

Yes, they added a boring base design minigame. Other games do that far better. Okay, weapon and gear modification. Too bad all the weapon designs are awful and Bethesda thinks that adding adjectives and attachments to a limited selection of guns means variety. Power Armor is ruined if you like wearing it a lot, and made a major point of the game even to people like me who never liked using it.  They actually took away features. No karma system. No weapon/gear condition. Do you remember complaining about either of these things? Yeah, Bethesda had trouble getting the whole ""moral grey area"" thing in Fallout 3, but removing the concept entirely from 3D Fallout? SPECIAL and perks are completely ruined, they just act as FPS style buffs rather than anything that would really effect your play style. Skills don't even exist anymore... Is any of this at all excusable because of better shooting mechanics and a kinda cool layered armor system?  The setting's awful. Boston was probably always gonna be pretty boring compared to most major American cities (we honestly could've had a Fallout in the Deep South instead of Fallout 3.5 minus any recognizable landmarks...), but the map is tiny and the world is boring. I walked to Diamond city without anything attacking me. Even worse, I walked to Diamond city without feeling compelled to explore or investigate a single damn thing in this open world. Bethesda uses some cartoonish character designs/animations and colors that really stand out as absolutely terrible in a series that's supposed to look gritty and talk clever.  Dialogue's ruined. The wheel doesn't even accurately tell me what my character will say. You only ever have four options, which are almost always ""nice response"", ""mean response"", ""sarcastic"", or ""question/speech check/lie"". It's an absolute joke to call a game this simplified a real RPG. Oh, and Bethesda created a character with a backstory, set motivations, and A SINGLE VOICE ACTOR (per sex). I can't roleplay in this roleplaying game...  If I still haven't convinced you not to play this game (please pirate it if you have to), consider how terribly it's written. Yes, all of dialogue is contrived and boring, but the train doesn't stop there! So the main plot, with the son and spouse. Cool, I'm glad the character that Bethesda created for me cares about them, but why should I? The prewar sequence is kinda cool in a lot of ways, but it's so short and contains nothing that would make me remotely attached to the would be female player character or an extremely bad looking baby that you literally never see do anything but scream and get kidnapped. God damn, I even care more about James from FO3... Oh yeah, Bethesda started working on the concepts for the game about the father from the vault finding his son in the wasteland right after we finished the game about the son from the vault finding his father in the wasteland. Bravo, it's like poetry. I guess Bethesda really wants to waste a postapocalyptic setting on personal family stories instead of, you know, significant geopolitical developments influenced by you and your companions a la 1, 2, and New Vegas... Yet, the pacing is the most glaringly obvious problem. Within the first hour, you have power armor, a companion, a minigun (THAT DOESN'T DETERIORATE), and a few hundred caps if you aren't stupid. That ""immersive"" voiced player character has a pretty interesting nonexistant reaction to being thrown into the apocalypse and having to fight a ton of radioactive monsters only a few hours after he woke up and got ready. This isn't Fallout. This isn't even a good game. For anything else, a 6/10 at best. For a AAA title from one of my favorite series that was hyped up to be a real game changer, a 0 is the closest justice (next to a refund) that is deserved.… Expand "

Those are as much information as the game will give you. Often your character will end up saying something you did no intend.  As shown in various trailers and demos you start as either husband or wife, both from a military background, with a son and whether you want or not your character will genuinely love their spouse. No option is given in this regard. Lead writer Emil Pagliarulo said in an interview this set story and the voice were created to deepen the story. No Fallout before has ever limited who your character was so severely.  All values of the original two games and Fallout New Vegas are discarded. Quests are only solvable in the one specific way spoon fed to you. Situations where a person is scripted to be killed cannot be altered or prevented in any way. There is no reputation system, not even the Kharma system returns.  The characters are one-dimensional. They are cliches. The loyal Paladin, the lawful sheriff, the greedy hired gun, the stupid strongman. They do what you expect and nothing else. The vast majority are defined by a single characteristic. They love old baseball paraphernalia and give you a quest to collect a bat, a glove and a card or they love to paint and send you out to get some. Those are the interesting ones. There are dozens of people sending you to kill raiders, mutants and ghouls.  Alongside those you meet the synths. Those are the four types of enemies you'll spent fighting in almost every dungeon right from the start. Supermutants are no longer end game enemies. They give as much experience as raiders or ghouls. There are elite and legendary versions of everything. They do a lot more damage and soak a lot of damage but their tactics do not change at all from normal versions.  This game is essentially just a reskin of Skyrim. You crawl linear dungeons, skinned as buildings and vaults rather than caves and forts to kill and loot items from enemies to sell them for money. Pretty easily you end up with more money than you can ever spend and you only run through the dungeons to get the one item you were asked to retrieve or sometimes the one enemy you need to kill, which almost all quests amount to apart from those asking you to speak with someone.  The crafting and building system is awful. All crafting is locked behind various perks as is installing shops and doctors to your settlements. Instead of just looting valuable weapons and armor in Fallout 4 you are encouraged to collect rare junk items for scrapping as well. However there is no autoscrap function. All items have to be dropped into the world and scrapped one by one in the building mode adding more to the routine of selling and storing after visiting a dungeon. Apart from the horrible console oriented controls the build mode offers very limited options. It is not possible to build a real house. Even if it's newly build 200 years after the apocalypse it still looks like a badly thrown together shed.… Expand "

I'm expecting laughtracks after every line a character says. I would suspect that if you took the dialogue from this game and passed it off as a script you would have an episode of ""The Big Bang Theory"". And thats not a **** good thing, if you even crack a smile while watching that show you should seriously contemplate walking in front of a subway car.  Third the voice actors are even worse than the lines they are reading which I didn't even think could be possible but these acting school dropouts managed it. Where the hell did they find these guys ? Did all the ""talented"" voice actors go out on that ""voice actor"" strike ??? PFFFFFT. They are just terrible but than again maybe they read the lines themselves and were thinking the whole time ""They really don't plan to sell this to people ???? Do they ??"", maybe the actors aren't to blame.  4th. Gamplay. It is atrocious its a **** travesty. I mean the Fallout3 and FNV gameplay were pretty **** terrible considering the majority of it took place through VATS, but this game takes **** to a whole new level. Its some horrible hybrid of Borderlands(also terrible) and Mass Effect(literally the worst game ever) mashed together for the game that nobody wanted but every moron is going to by because the TV and Internet told them too. I thought this was supposed to be an RPG ? How do i level up my skills ? Do I even have skills ? Where the **** are the RPG elements ? Where are the leveling points ? perks ? traits ??

Then, Dragon Age 2 decided to throw all of that out the window and introduce a dialogue wheel and a voiced protagonist. It was a resounding flop and alienated a large portion of RPG fans.  The weapons, crafting, and FPS aspects are a great improvement, but this is overshadowed by the fact that the dialogue options are now limited to nothing more than Yes No Maybe Sarcastic with a very limited number of characters you can talk to. Having really good gun mechanics and weapon crafting with a lack of dialogue and RPG elements makes you Borderlands 3, not Fallout. And I do not like the Borderlands series, because it is clearly that - a boring, repetitive first person shooter pretending to be an RPG.  If you want an RPG with great writing and dialogue, see Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas, Wasteland 2, Pillars of Eternity, Morrowind, Oblivion, and so on. This dialogue wheel bollocks is pushing the Fallout series dangerously close to generic FPS interactive movie territory, and to see such a great universe go to waste is heartbreaking. Fallout 4 is a good, even great game on its own, but as a Fallout fan it feels like they listened too much to the people complaining that Fallout 3 and New Vegas had bad combat FPS characteristics, and not enough to the people who like RPGs. In other words, the balance between RPG and FPS has shifted a bit too much towards standard FPS. The voiced protagonist also limits role playing and player agency, and I think it simply is not a good idea. That said, none of these things are making the game unplayable or unenjoyable, just a disappointment since I know what Fallout 1, 2, 3, and New Vegas were like with better dialogue and more characters to talk to.  Bethesda has done a wonderful job of recreating the atmosphere of the Fallout world, it is just the lacking dialogue and character interaction that really, really miffs me - I'll be enjoying the world one moment and the next this awful voice acting and writing breaks immersion and reminds me I'm playing this badly written character instead of my own as in previous games. I hope this decision to go to a wheel is reversed but all other changes seem good.  In summation, if the dialogue and conversation wasn't completely gutted and awful relative to the previous games I'd probably give this game a 10 out of 10. If this really was Borderlands 3 I'd say it was a great improvement over the originals. But this is a Fallout game, and I was expecting an engrossing, well-written dialogue system with characters to talk to and instead was stuck with a dialogue wheel. The dialogue wheel and voiced protagonist are incredibly disappointing as a longtime Fallout fan, but it is definitely worth a look and undeserving of the red review scores.  If you are new to this series, you will find a lot to enjoy. If you are a previous fan, I think you to will find the dialogue system and lack of NPCs that will talk to you quite sad. It holds its own as a game if you do not compare it to previous installments, but therein lies the problem - this is Fallout, and the thing RPG fans fear the most is their beloved, deep role playing games being distilled to a very generic, on-rails experience where they are being told a story instead of creating their own story with branching dialogue and alternative paths.  TL;DR: Worth a look if you like MMORPG/Borderlands type grindfests with no dialogue; disappointing dialogue system for fans of the previous games. New players will find a lot to enjoy and think this is a ""deep"" game, older fans will have to compromise and accept the questionable decision to pull a Dragon Age 2 and move to a dialogue wheel and voiced protagonist and greatly limit the amount of conversation you can have with people. All other aspects of the game are so greatly improved that it is disappointing that someone was paid for this insanely bad writing.  I predict Elder Scrolls VI will have only one race you can choose from and it will be horribly voice acted with ""Press X to be Sarcastic.""… Expand "

The game crashed twice and forced me to reload three times because of a persisting bug with terminals and character getting stuck.  The UI is really, really bad. There's no keybinding consistency and loot menu is very counter intuitive. To navigate it you must do three things at the same time. Keep your mouse coursor on an object, scroll with your wheel and use a keyboard key to move items into your inventory.  I'm constantly finding myself having to alternate between navigating with WSAD and a mouse to switching to directional arrows to navigate dialogue. In menus I'm confirming with e, then suddenly e cancels all my choices cause I was supposed to press space or enter. It's really, really bad.  The visuals are decent but definitely not at a level that warrants that high system requirements and performance this poor.  Overall I gotta say that I'm not impressed. This isn't a finished game and shouldn't be released in this state. Shame on you Bethesda. Was going to be a game of the year and it seems we're in for a dissapointment of the year.

This backlash Bethesda is getting is natural, they stepped on too many feet and lied to way too many people on the way with the franchise to not end up in such situation.  1) Group of 'old' tactical isometric view RPGs fans, which loved their Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics. Why Bethesda could not create their own postapocalyptic world akin to Skyrim (they helped publishing the series at start but failed in continuation of development)? Why did they feel it is a good idea to gut franchise from one genere and stuff things they think they specialize in? People from this group were disappointed in Fallout 3 (again, because of genere and playstyle change) but they were buying into 'trying out the game' out of nostalgia. Some were furiously disappointed some liked it in the end, because it were 'still like Fallout' in it's core character building system... which this time got thrown out and replaced with premade 'talent trees'.  2) Then there is group of people who enjoyed Fallout 3 and NV and franchise in new genere setting. They are RPG fans, loved the system, world and expected to get more and better version in Fallout 4. What they got instead is again different genere but this time it's an FPS with some story elements and mundane tasks. Missions (now only gun blazing and pick ups), puzzle solving, interaction, character building. It all got cut down or cut out, streamlined if you please for casuals. However this group feels stiffled - Bethesda did not delivered on their promises.  3) Yet another group are the people who just want to play 'best games'. But it is tricky to define what they consider best. T hey will compare graphics, size of created world, hours of gameplay, stability of the game (lack of bugs etc.) and be very quantitative about it. Bethesda has some fault here and some bad luck as well. Recently published games (not gonna start naming them cause I don't want this to get derailed, what's bigger better discussion this group strives in) that fall into genere they claimed Fallout 4 is had better graphics, larger more vibrant worlds, more bang for the buck and then there are glitches, crashes and save corrupting bugs which Bethesda is known for and let slip to Fallout 4 as well. Outrage? Ofcourse. This group thrives on it but still they are pretty damn self-aware customers. They know what they want, they sing peans when they get it and are complete dicks when they are promised something and then underdelivered.  My view on what is happening: Bethesda made what they do best with all the shoddy and lose parts included as usual, which fans grew to overlook. However they used franchise they didn't create and never understood (tried to redefine it instead), wound up a huge hype campaign around their product and directed it at the wrong target audience (perhaps to create a new niche they'd fit in, somewhere between FPSs and RPGs) and it all backfired. Game could be o-k and it would definetly be acclaimed if it were a newly created world (franchise) and marketed to fans of FPS and FPS with RPG elements but instead it gets smashed by disapointed, disgruntled customers. Not some mythical 'vocal minority' but majority of customers who found in the box not what was on the cover so to speak. And there's absolutely nothing wrong about it. It's actually great en masse (game industry should learn on this case similar as outrage swatted away abhorent pre-order system for new DeusEx... less marketing, less hype building), if not for few people going over the line in their 'anger'.… Expand "

I've played older games were artistic teams were able to deliver much more beautiful and polished graphics with much less in terms of technology.  DIALOGS AND NPCS After I saw the ""wheeled"" dialog choices and the player character speaking in trailers. Mass effect came to my mind, but it's not even close in terms of immersion. I didn't feel attached to any of the characters in Fallout 4, and the dialogues were very unsatisfying, boring, uncreative, and the worst of it - DOESN'T MATTER AT ALL - No choices are really made.  STORY The plot is so unimaginative that I never really felt involved or the urge to persuit something. And the side quests are ridiculous kill and fetch chores which doesn't add anything to the game or it's lore. I don't think the people who ""wrote"" this quests play games at all. I really felt intellectually offended.  GAMEPLAY To simple put, it's a mess, the controls are laggy due massive drops in FPS for no apparent reason. The VATS feel more like a cheap ""fix"" for a broken and boring gameplay mechanics than a feature. It's neither a 3rd person tactical combat, nor a realtime first-person-shooter. A tactical combat would have something like cover, slow thinking combat or even a semi turn-based system, and a FPS would have bold physics, stable fps and well designed levels to guide a player trough them. Fallout 4 fails as much as a gameplay engine as in terms of level design. After few hours, combat were nothing but a chore.  VEREDICT I always thought Bathesda games lacked quality in many aspects, specially artistically compared to other well-founded companies. But their games were ambitious and had unique concepts to get my attention. But in my opinion, they never really delivered top-quality products for me to consider their games an ""A"" quality. However, after Skyrim seemed to me that they took some criticism serious and tried to improve, but Fallout 4 proved me I was wrong, they don't give a s**t about quality.  However, I'm giving a 3/10 because bashing enemies heads with a melee weapon still fun, and the construction mechanics still have potential (if you like sandbox games).

The game still uses the buggy Creation Engine and it's abhorrent collision detection that allows bugs such as: -walking underwater; not swimming, walking -cars clipping into the ground and then exploding -falling through the ground because you stood on something and intersected its hitbox so the game teleports you underground -Dogmeat bringing you an item only to drop it through the floor -You can pick up the engine in the river under the bridge on your way to Concord and use it to fly by jumping with it  Bethesda still hasn't fixed the issue of companions blocking doors and walkways, you can clip through the floor, but you'll never ever clip through your companion. Maybe they should apply the companion hitbox to the floors and walls.  The story is a pathetic and clichéd ""I must rescue my son, where is my son"" story, that's weirdly paced, and your character's motivations don't really match your possible actions actions; you either join Father and help the Institute hide away forever with their robots, or you blow up the Institute. The entire game tells you that the Institute is some sort of bogeyman kidnapping people in the night, but it never actually happens to anyone in the game. This is poor writing, just telling and not showing.  The game auto-detects controllers and disables mouse and keyboard input while it's plugged in, which really adds to the feel of it's a bad console port, and the controls are weirdly designed i.e. melee/throw grenade/hold breath are the same key, and you can't separate them into different key-binds, leading to many awkward grenade throws after sniping, or throwing a grenade when you wanted to melee someone up close.  Skills have been change from a levelling up due to use to a more washed out, and casual, perk based skill system. Instead of using a skill to get better at it, every time you level up you just pick a skill to level up with you.  People are just becoming complacent with Bethesda producing the same low quality game, that cuts more and more corners with every iteration of their games, removing multiple features but adding a shiny new one to distract everyone from what was removed. Removing things like: -survival difficulty, where you need to drink, eat and seek doctors to fix damaged limbs. -waiting, something you use to change the time of day to a more favourable time to attack, to just limiting it only when you're seated in a chair. -multiple conversation choices, to be limited to just 4 possible choices, hardly able to get information out of characters when you can only have 4 questions.  People have come to expect to fall through the floor in a Bethesda game and no longer even see that as a problem; but it is, it always was.  The game runs, looks, feels and plays like it was made half-assed in a month using the majority of Fallout 3's code, improving upon nothing but adding in the base building gimmick that was originally just a mod.

In terms of concrete game design, it's better in a lot of ways than 3/NV. The crafting system is amazing and has so much depth, and it will really thrive with the modding scene I think.  The settlement building system has some interesting concepts but in real terms has poor implementation - you can flatten an entire building for scrap in like 10 seconds - but I think this definitely has a lot of potential and I can see it improving(Again, doubly so with mods. See what I mean?).  The gun play is vastly improved. The Call of Duty hitmarker stuff is a bit unnecessary but I'm not bothered by it. I'm sure there'll be a mod(again) to disable it, though this should have obviously been a game menu option from release. But overall the gunplay has developed into a solid shooter.  The dialogue wheel, however, is probably one of the worst design choices that nobody ever asked for. Like seriously, I've never sat through a Bethesda game and thought ""You know what I want? A vague dialogue wheel which wont give me all the information I need to make informed decisions."" It's a bad choice, it needs to go and never see the light of day in any other games. It's bad, bad, bad.  The character creation system is probably one of the best I've seen, especially from a Bethesda publication. I'm also still coming to grips with the Perk/Skill system but I'm liking it.  However, all in all, the design choices are massively overshadowed by the terrible bugs and development practices. For that I would recommend a DO NOT BUY. Wait it out for a few months at least.… Expand "

They showed great improvement from their prequels; there were, of course, shortfalls, but gamers could feel that Bethesda put great degree of effort and care into the game, so we gamers (not all, but majority) were satisfied and loved playing the game.  This time, however, Fallout 4 launching showed how Bethesda got lazy. I feel like Bethesda and Todd Howard became bastard nephews who live on their uncle's generosity (Bethesda name value and already established systems & world from prequels). I wouldn’t surprise if devs are thinking like 'Hey, even if we show **** of laziness, modders gonna finish sanding and polishing!' If I hadn't played previous Bethesda game series, I could give more generous rating, but I played Bethesda games since Arena and witnessed its evolution; Fallout 4 is such disappointment and is a shameful sequel when compared to its prequels.  Game engine and environment middleware cost money, and yes, everyone wants to reduce production cost and maximize profit; I understand that. Bethesda, however, has been doing this - bugs, shameful in-game envirment and graphics which is two or three gen behind - for more than ten years while milking money out of its loyal fans, and there is barely a sign of improvement thanks to its chronic laziness and ignorance.  Just look at other games from this generation. Well, actually, others games from several generations back even showed better gameplay environment. When you play Fallout 4 after playing games like Last of Us (which is from three years ago), you would feel like you are in the world of ragdoll.  I usually put less emphasis on technical issues and in-game environment like graphics and physics engine, since gamers still can acquire great gameplay experience and deep emersion without superb graphics when the game is well designed. But Bethesda, seriously, this is just too much, and you got lazy.  Decent game, thanks to already-established world settings and systems, but huge disappointment.

I don't dislike Fallout 4 because it's popular - I dislike Fallout 4 because it's frustrating and dull. I am simply not having a good time with this game.  A lot of the changes and new additions to Fallout 4, I really like. The crafting system is well-implemented, and gives you a great variety of customisation options for your weapons and armour. In the case of weapons especially, these upgrades aren't just minor stat boosts - they each change the look of the weapon you're using, making it feel like your own. This is a HUGE step in the right direction for Bethesda, and something I hope carries over to the next Elder Scrolls game as well as future Fallout titles. The workshop, a base-building feature, is also highly addictive. You're given a lot of freedom to create structures, power them, add crafting stations, turrets and traps to defend your home, and so on. It would benefit from a top-down camera for better precision when placing items,  but it's definitely a good start.  Graphically, the game isn't as bad as everyone's saying. Environments look nice, despite some laughably low-resolution textures in some places. Character models, on the other hand, are awful - flat, plastic-looking faces, bad lip-syncing, and shoddy animation (with a couple of exceptions). Conversations are dull, and gone are the lists of dialogue options - you get four options, and they don't branch off or change things very much. The story is very linear overall.  Here's an example of how linear the story is, in as spoiler-free a manner as possible: I found myself in a standoff between myself & my companion and a group of armed thugs. Being a charismatic character, I persuaded the leader of the thugs to let us go without a fight, so I left the area. My companion, however, did not. I had to run back to him, and engage the enemies I'd just persuaded to let us leave. Why was I given the option to talk my way out of a fight if I had to fight regardless? This isn't player choice, it's saying ""No, this isn't how you were supposed to do that, now go back and do it the way we want you to do it!"".  The main storyline itself is not even remotely engaging. There's no meaningful choices to make, the karma system has been completely removed, and it's impossible to role play anyone other than a worried parent looking for their child. Want to be an evil character? You're in the wrong place for that. Fallout is no longer an RPG - it's a first person shooter with very light RPG elements. Skills, stats, and everything RPG-like has been stripped down to a perk chart, of which you get to put a single point into once you level up.  Combat is awful. If the gunplay was ""inspired by Destiny"", then I don't want to play Destiny. You can shoot enemies point blank and them not take damage. Shooting enemies doesn't even make them flinch, either - they only react once you've crippled a limb or killed them. They also have ridiculous amounts of health - I'd gotten through one rather large building having exhausted all the ammo I had for at least five different weapons, and maybe fought a dozen enemies at most. This is on the ""normal"" difficulty setting, by the way. At one point I'd unloaded over 200 minigun rounds on two enemies, and one of them was still standing.  I've played around ten hours of Fallout 4, and can't bring myself to continue.

At first it wouldn't load, then it had graphical errors. -Not optimized for PC: requires editing of the .ini files to fix the field of view and turn off mouse acceleration. -Sloppy console port: UI is terrible, laggy, obviously designed for use with a controller and no effort has been made to polish it for the PC version. -Horrendously dated graphics, yet still extremely taxing! (I have two R9 290x in crossfire and only get 40 fps in 4K) -Terrible, awful, disjointed, badly stitched together voice acting. Sentences composed of words hacked from several other recordings makes it sound terrible. Immediately breaks any immersion you might have been getting. -Facial animations are awful. -Storyline is dry as sand. -No instruction or help whatsoever as to how things work in the game. VATS is not introduced, crafting is not introduced, nothing. -The looting system is frustrating, requiring to you pick up everything in order to get the one thing you actually want. -The dialog system is dumbed down -Gunplay is bad. Firefights feel dull and forced. -Dog gets in the way and body-blocks you. -Blood and gore effects do not look realistic. -The gameplay elements we'd come to know in Fallout 3 and New Vegas (SPECIAL and the Perks system) have been stripped away and replaced with a much simpler unexciting system.  This game is just bad. Just all around bad. These positive professional reviews are completely fake and paid for. Anyone with a set of eyes and 2 brain cells can see what a steaming pile of excrement this is.… Expand "
dvst11,"Nov 10, 2015",0," I have been a fan of the series for a long time. This entry is a huge disappointment. A sad day for open world RPG lovers. All of the role playing has been removed from the game via the dialog wheel and voiced character. I tried to look over these things and enjoy the game, but there are countless other huge simplifications made and it feels too shallow. "

Yes, comparing it to Fallout 3 and New Vegas makes it harder to swallow. Fallout 4 lacks the general RPG elements that were so immersive in those titles, with a heavier focus on combat that screams Battlefield Fallout rather than what we expect from the Bethesda franchise by now. It also has bugs and glitches all over the shop, but manages to just about stay roped together enough to avoid this being a complete disaster.  Graphically, this is sub-par. Not much of an improvement on, say, Skyrim really. But with all those flaws aside, this is still a massive, well made post-apocalyptic experience, which I'd class as an FPS with RPG elements, rather than a first-person RPG.  You can safely wait to pick this up on sale quite frankly, but you won't regret playing it. If you're new to the idea of Fallout, you'd be best served going back and playing Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas before picking this up. The low scores for Fallout 4 are a result of the hype before the game not meeting the reality of the release, rather than a score of the games actual quality - the zero scores are even dumber than the nines in this regard, and are kneejerk, hysterical overreactions.  That said, the practice of over-hyping games needs to stop. It is a direct result of the pre-order culture. People, start learning lessons, wait for a games release, try a demo if you can, THEN buy it if you want to, instead of buying into a game that doesn't exist yet.… Expand "
CreamyyStreams,"Nov 15, 2015",6," It's a Bethesda RPG and performs exactly as you'd expect. The world is immense and, in its way, beautiful.

There's plenty to do, lots of things to find, places to explore and people to meet. Levelling is reasonably satisfying, a marginal improvement over Skyrim's and a marginal step down from Fallout 3 and NV. I'm sure I'll enjoy getting lost in the wasteland for a few dozen hours.  However, the knife cuts both ways. Alongside all the great things you can always expect from this calibre of game from Bethesda come a whole lot of negatives.  One of the more immediately noticeable flaws is visual fidelity - or rather, lack thereof. It looks like a game made in 2011, and unfortunately it doesn't even run particularly well to make up for it. It sits around 50fps on an i5 and 970 and there are some noticeable frame drops. Turning off godrays seems to help a little, but a game this visually unimpressive shouldn't require sacrifices to run at a stable framerate. It's unpleasant to tank to the mid-30s every time there's an explosion on screen.  It's also rife with bugs. We all expected it, but this is an engine that's been around for more than a decade. You'd have thought they'd have figured out how to stop the AI running into walls, elevator floors cutting out and sending you plummeting and corpses flying around violently by now. Not to mention CTDs - I've experienced two in ten hours so far. There is very, very little new technology in this game - CTDs should not be happening. Remarkably as of yet I have not been launched a thousand feet into the air and ragdolled nor have I fallen through the earth into blue space, so take that as you will.  Keys are not rebindable, which is a pretty nasty oversight in this day and age. There's also a conspicuous lack of adjustable FOV, meaning you'll need an .ini tweak or console command to escape console claustrophobia.  The writing is atrocious, but that's forgiveable because it's a Bethesda RPG and it'd be delusional to expect otherwise. The bigger issue is character animation. A huge quantity of body language is this game is ripped straight from Skyrim - you've probably seen the clip of 'hat man' at the beginning of the game equipping his clipboard like a shield. Facial animations are impressively awful and regularly resemble those silly over-the-top lipsync videos people make in Source. Voice acting is weak, but again what else would you expect.  Gunplay in this game is not good. Everything feels a bit floaty and it's not helped by the odd mouse acceleration/smoothing it forces on you. There doesn't seem to be any way to disable it. Perhaps it's better with a controller, but why would you play Fallout with a controller.  I'd imagine this seems overly critical, even for a 6/10 review, but it's genuinely difficult to recommend this game in its current state. Ultimately it doesn't matter, since it's Fallout and you'll damn well buy it anyway like the rest of us, just please don't go into it thinking it's the same calibre as other heavy-hitters to have come out this year - MGSV and TW3 both blow it out of the water.  If you have any degree of self control, wait for patches.… Expand "

Loving this game now, mainly due to the new sandbox elements that have not been present in previous fallout games, and a few mod tweaks to make the game more challenging, but not tediously so... A mod to bring more depth to the perk system would make this game truly fly... and I really think they should have made survival mode a locked in option at the start of the game (like in fallout NV) and give the player some reward (like an exclusive and fun perk) to encourage them to play a version of the game that actually requires strategy and knowledge of the various enemies.  Those who are complaining about graphics need to remember that this is an RPG. Graphics wingers can get stuffed as far as I'm concerned... entitled brats. Fallout 4 is a beautifully constructed environment. Those complaining about a lack of RP depth, I feel your pain, but I really do believe the perk system can be built upon in the future, by modders or Bethesda themselves. And the sandbox elements (with some mod tweaks) are excellent, and really do add something to the fallout world that was missing in previous games.  People are judging this game harshly because of the grandness of the Witcher 3. But I think Fallout 4 offers some things that the Witcher doesn't. It offers a longer RPG experience (if you play survival difficulty and utilize base building properly), sandbox elements,  a lot more personalisation of the main character, more influence over the game world, and the opportunity to kill raiders with teddy bears. I personally enjoy a game world more closely related to the real world. Less fantasy/wizard/unicorn nonsense and ye olde tavern crap.… Expand "
Prey111,"Nov 10, 2015",0, Bethesda is known for making boring buggy games.  The facial animation on the PC/NPCs barely show any facial expressions.

The overall gameplay is repetitive and dull. The story is boring and makes no sense.

""Sarcastic."" So basically your dialogue wheel choices imitate a low-intelligence character from the previous Fallout games.  As a longtime Fallout fan I can see where some of the complaints are coming. Particularly the inclusion of the dialogue wheel. I dislike the dialogue wheel and the lack of conversations. You could have long, in depth conversations with people in previous games and so far I have not see that as much. Other than that, the game is quite good. The gunplay is vastly improved and feels wonderful, exploring is great, Inon Zur did an amazing job with the ambient music, and it's generally a well-put together world that is a pleasure to be back in. But none of that matters because the voiced protagonist and dialogue wheel make Fallout a bland, boring FPS grindfest and it ruins the role playing. Since Fallout was a role playing game, that is what I thought I was getting into. Voiced protagonists and dialogue wheels have no place in this series, they don't fit, and what's worse - there is really no dialogue choice at all in this game after 23 hours of playtime. No matter what you choose, you go down a preset dialogue path and you cannot have a simple conversation. All dialogue is there with the goal of getting the quest rather than asking about the world, about the person you're talking to.  There's no real depth. I don't know if the writers are to blame or the executives, but someone made the decision to severely limit dialogue and conversation in a Fallout game and that is a large reason for these negative scores. If this was a mediocre grindfest like Borderlands, the lack of conversation might be excusable. It's not here.  Good things about the game: Bethesda captured the aesthetic of the Fallout universe well. The music is as good as always, and weapons, fighting, and crafting are well done. However, this just further exaggerates the lack of RPG characteristics. Developers seem to be confusing MMORPG grinds with singleplayer RPGs which depend on dialogue.  Conclusion: I wish there was more RPG in this game. That is, better dialogue choices and instead of a wheel, something like previous versions gave us. I think moving to a dialogue wheel and lack of dialogue trees is a step in the wrong direction, while all other changes are a step in the right direction.  It's a good game in the other aspects and certainly does not deserve all the ZERO scores but this is a massive shame. I am trying to be optimistic about future expansions from Bethesda and even a New Vegas like game where Obsidian once again gets a shot at their own Fallout game. Please get rid of this childish, limiting dialogue which turns this game into an FPS - a good FPS, but an FPS nonetheless.  All other aspects of this game were great, so it's a shame that this terrible decision to limit dialogue and have a voice actor (which itself limits the amount of available dialogue) ruins my enjoyment. I'm going to finish this game only because I love Fallout and I waited 7 years since Fallout 3 and 5 since New Vegas, but I am disappointed with the decision to make this an FPS first and an MMORPG grind second rather than an actual singleplayer RPG with cleverly written dialogue choices, branching paths depending on those choices, and the ability to make my own story with my own protagonist instead of having a pre-recorded protagonist forced on me by the game.

I like and play Bethesda games, but I recognize that they sometimes drop the ball and create bad products. I was gladly surprised to find out that this wasn't the case with Fallout 4.  In general the game is good, a solid 8. I've been playing it 9+ hours a day for the last 3 days and I'm having a lot of fun. Some points worth mentioning are:  - People complain about the graphics and it's true, the models do look outdated and I was kinda disappointed at the beginning. On the other hand, the more I played I started to really like the world; the weather effects and geography are great. I also found the general artwork fantastic, the color palette contrasting wasteland with colorful buildings was a great idea and it infused the game with an unique identity. Sort of what Dishonored has. Play it for a while and you'll see what I'm talking about. Lighting is very, very good too.  - Crafting system: I found it very engaging. It's complicated and interesting, I really feel like collecting all that junk to build stuff at my settlements. While playing I also think a lot about how much effort they put to make all weapons and armor variations, good job guys. The unique weapons that you can craft are very well designed too, sort of like the rail-gun in Fallout 3.  -Gun play and shooting feel really smooth and V.A.T.S has also been improved with more info such as resistances. Definitively an upgrade here.  - Companions: their movement is a bit clunky and they're always getting into trouble, especially the dog. I built him a house sent him there to chew his toys early in the game. However, I liked the friendship developing system with your other companions, it reminded me of Dragon Age or Mass Effect.  - Plot: starts a bit cheesy, but it soon gets interesting. I really care about what is going to happen. Much much less cringe by time unit compared to recent movies and other games' plots and dialogues (I'm looking at you Blizzard)  - Bugs: I haven't found anything important yet.… Expand "

A lot of gamers world wide are going crazy because it's not this or that, but what were they really expecting? This game goes along Bethesda's RPG tradition by letting you make the story. There is nothing quite like going through a world crafted with some of the wildest atmosphere in any game, and being able to do as you wish. If I wanted to go mad crazy and kill everyone in every town, I very well could... or perhaps I could just stay by myself and wonder aimlessly until I find something shiny in the wasteland. Either way, you, the player, gets to role play how you want. The role playing isn't too technical or significant, but it's simple. Simple enough that I can enjoy playing without regretting my decisions I made for my character, and not too much that I can't just grab all the special perks that'll make my ""OP"" instantly. Although, there is no level cap, so technically you could level up and get all the special abilities and become unstoppable, but that would take incredibly long. Moving on to length, to put a dent into this game, you'll need to spend some serious gaming time. Like hundreds of hours. The map might not be bigger than previous Bethesda games, but they sure do pack a lot in such a scrumptious wasteland. After completing dozens of quests myself, not yet done with the main story either, the game feels like a true world with too much to do. That's a good thing to have too much of in a game like this, where there is so much variety, I haven't even thought about slowing down or even got bored for that matter. In the end, the 10/10 means that this is a true game worth playing, at least once in your life. I have praised every Bethesda game, but not quite like this one. It has got everything from atmosphere to intriguing plots and things to do. Why are you reading this, play the thing already.… Expand "

These are few and far between and will likely be resolved in an update so I am not removing a point for it. The change to dialog is also not necessarily an improvement over the old system and has led to some bugs related to subtitles not updating during the conversation which can impact those who are hard of hearings experience with the game. Again though I expect this to be resolved in a future update so I'm not too worried about it but feel people should be made aware.

The graphics are beautiful, and, while not ""photo-realistic"" or anything, they are still very beautiful. I enjoy the voice acting and while the voiced name is mostly a ""gimmick"", hopefully it can be used by modders and expanded upon by Bethesda in future updates/DLC and upcoming games.  I was a bit frustrated with the keyboard command layout - I did not like how it was set up, and changing it could be difficult, if not impossible.  The game's potential, once modders get a hold of the necessary tools, is enormous! I look forward to seeing just what the community does with the game.  I am old enough to remember playing Fallout when it originally cam out. Is this the same game? No. Does this game fit in the same universe? Sure!

Oh, and if your complaints are about the lack of an FOV slider, or godrays - this is why they have an ini file. It's easy enough to change them.

I was damn excited, my expectations were insanely high, especially with a week or more of spoiler ridden Reddit posts and forums. I expected an unplayable bug ridden game that you couldn't play normally. So yeah I started it, played for quite a few hours and I admit I had some funny bugs, but nothing close to what people were writing on steam or what people are writing on Metacritic.  To make it clear, I played the game on 2 PCs and on a laptop. One PC is a 3 year old gaming rig, the other PC is brand new Gaming rig, and the gaming laptop is an Asus ROG laptop, anyway, the game looked great! And I know that it's a subjective matter, but the graphics are great, everything is updated from the previous game that used this engine(Skyrim). The only thing I didn't really like are the damn face animations, it's like the mouth of the person talking is detached from the rest of the 3D model. But then again I don't mind that in the least, next to Skyrim the facial animations are better.  The game runs great on all 3 machines, of course the old PC and laptop ain't running the game on Ultra, but even on High-Medium setting the game looks great and for me(FOR ME PERSONALLY) it ran at 60FPS almost constantly and zooming did not lower the FPS.  The dialogue and speech is TOP notch! The sound is so epic I get goosebumps every time I have to go into the menu, because that OST is freaking awesome. The world is really beautiful and big, and I mean big it's properly big, anyone saying, ""Oh but it's small... Look at the Pip-boy map"", is full of **** I didn't like the Dialogue system at first but I now I'm a fan of it. Basically in the vanilla version of Fallout 3 and New Vegas you always had 3 options on screen, then you had to scroll down to get more options, in Fallout 4 you have 4 options on screen and after selecting one, the dialogue tree branches out beautifully! The weapon modding is awesome, the armor modding is awesome, the settlement system is like the best thing I've ever seen, and I could sink 100 hours just into that (and I probably will :P). I just can't tell you enough that this game is really worth your time.  As with every game IN existance, there are bugs, but for the love of god, not even close to New Vegas or Fallout 3. And that is a bonus in my book! Bethesda actually releasing a game that isn't completely broken. Really, anyone reading these words, let me iterate my point, ""IT WORKS, IT ISN'T BROKEN, IT'S EPIC"". Anyone giving it a 0 should be ignored, because they mostly give NO actually information about what bugs them.  As with everything written on the internet ANYTHING must be taken with a pinch of salt. I admit I'm a really big fan of the game. But I'm not blind to the faults that Fallout 4 has, there are bugs, some people are writing that they are getting massive FPS drops, no ""Hardcore mode""(which I loved... :() and other artifacts. But nevertheless me giving the game a 10 means that even with the faults I see something beautiful in the game.

Benjamin99,"Nov 10, 2015",10, Best game I ever played. I have been a long fan of the fallout franchise since fallout 2 and shady-sands. And I can surely say this is the best fallout version yet. Some of the best mods that was in fallout 3 and New Vegas has been implemented in the core game of fallout 4 and it was a pleasant surprise. 10/10 a must buy for any RPG fan.

Instead, so far, it has been a really enjoyable experience.

Engine and Graphics: The only excuse for how this game looks and plays is that Bethesda honestly finished it in 2010 and they've been keeping it on ice until they needed to raise their profit statement after the failure of Elder Scrolls Online. I'm convinced a malevolent AI from the future sent Fallout 4 back in time to destroy the past. I shudder when I think of the assault on my CPU and graphics card every time I launch this unoptimized  Story: What story? All roads lead to ""Pick A Side"". No alternatives, no negotiations, no character development, no customization. It's a story on rails. Your character is already defined by Bethesda. It's an 'open world' game that has you by the collar, no leash to be found. You're held hostage until you arrive at the shamefully disappointing universal ending. My mouth was literally agape as I watched the PS1 era conclusion to the main storyline. Okay, let's see if we can change things up...I played through the main quest again. I randomly pushed buttons for responses for all of the choices and every single one leads to the same conclusion. Every choice is YES...sometimes it is a questioning YES...a sarcastic YES...a negative YES...but still ultimately YES. Why even bother to pretend I have a choice with that abysmal decision wheel. Just give me a cutscene and move me to the next area!  Gameplay: Every mission, but a few here and there, are fetch or rescue missions. The real reason early promotions focused on Dogmeat is to get you acclimated to the fact that you're no better than a dog. I spent most of my game running to save settlements. I would consciously avoid Preston Garvey, because I knew if talked to him I would be sent on yet another monotonous rescue mission. Not that they're difficult. Opponents run straight at you despite the fact you're lighting them up with gunfire.  Overall: This is is the most disappointing game of this generation. The fact that Bethesda has failed to even address the OVERWHELMING chorus of voices with legitimate complaints about this turd of a game is further proof of their undeserved arrogance. But, when you think about it, why should they answer to their consumers?  I'll admit...it's a hell of a business model. You release an unpolished and unfinished game made on an engine you've been using for almost a decade and allow the modders to fix and improve it over the next few years until they make it playable (if not great).  Unfortunately, since I bought a retail copy of the game I can't get my money back. Congratulations Bethesda on your brilliant gaming ponzi scheme. I demand answers for this POS...and I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who wants an explanation. So far all we're hearing is crickets and the thud of your bank deposits.… Expand "

In my honest opinion, it feels like they are getting lazier and lazier. There are plenty of problems in the game, leaving the bugs aside because they would need to invest money to fix them and we cant have a company doing that nowadays. The story could have being great, and that is a mayor point. They just took a great idea and implemented it in the worst possible way. There are plenty of choices for the player to do which seems to be important for the main plot but, ultimately, do nothing, being there for the sake of button smashing. In short, most of your “choices” don't matter at all. There are quest were you are sent to a combat zone, but you can literally walk through them, while naked and unarmed, but no one will pay you any attention. Half of the perks are simply useless, and, once you got the power armour (minute 10?), you have won. Once you have some levels, and you craft a good weapon of choice, most legendary enemies will go down in 4-5 hits while playing in survival (legendary deathclaw with two headshots? really?) Most heavy weapons are useless. Armour is useless because: power armour. I wish I could give it a -10. At least, you can blow the brotherhood's ship up. It's something.… Expand "

Telembrium,"Nov 10, 2015",6," Fallout 4, while still a fun game, is a large step backwards from previous titles in the series with issues ranging from questionable design decisions to poor optimisation to an identity crisis concerning the game's genre. The developers seem to be focusing on adding shallow secondary features rather than creating strong core features. Bethesda's games seem be getting more and more dumbedFallout 4, while still a fun game, is a large step backwards from previous titles in the series with issues ranging from questionable design decisions to poor optimisation to an identity crisis concerning the game's genre. The developers seem to be focusing on adding shallow secondary features rather than creating strong core features. Bethesda's games seem be getting more and more dumbed down with each rendition, and Fallout 4 is far from an exception to this trend. That's not to say that there aren't some innovations, but they're too few and too insignificant to make up for the removed content.  By far the most flagrant issue with Fallout 4 is the voiced protagonist and the ramifications of its addition. A voiced protagonist could have actually meant good things for the series, but instead it has heralded the removal of a large degree of player freedom and choice. Dialogue has been stripped bare, and a large number of other questionable changes were undoubtedly influenced by the decision to have a voiced protagonist.  One of the game’s main issues which was obviously inspired by the voiced protagonist is the dialogue. Only four options are given for every conversation, and most of them follow a set template of yes, no, sarcastic, and maybe. When it’s not a template conversation, it usually doesn't even matter what you choose, as the response will just be the same with slight variations, which often leads to jarring and discontinuous conversations. You don't get options which allow you to play antagonistically and your mannerism doesn't change with your character's S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. The only stat which matters in dialogue is charisma, and even then it’s only for speech checks. Almost all of the dialogue options you have are either morally ambiguous or directly related to the predetermined backstory, and a lot of the dialogue options given are also duplicates of questions which you have most likely already had answered by a different NPC. At least the voice acting has improved significantly relative to Skyrim, but it's still not anything special.  The main story of Fallout 4 is bland, uninspired, and full of clichés. It's like someone wrote the entire story in one night after watching a sci-fi marathon on television. As for quests, they're pretty mediocre: go here, kill that, talk to this guy, yada yada. The only branching I've found was at one point in the main quest, but it was more of a choice of whether you wanted to continue or just quit there than an actual branch.  Yet another place where Bethesda has dumbed down the game is in the removal of skills. Not only has this made the game less dynamic in gameplay, it has removed the various skill checks from the already suffering dialogue. Perks have been expanded in lieu of skills, but almost all of them are combat-oriented and dull. Lady killer/black widow don't even give custom dialogue. Most offensive of all, though, is the fact that you can now increase your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats at a rate of one per level, rendering any strategic placement of your starting stats effectively null and severely reducing replay value.  Where has Bethesda put all of their development effort, then? Well, guns now operate like they would in a traditional shooter, and there is a mediocre cover system. It's too bad that the AI improvements are limited to failing to use the cover system instead of actually attacking and being able to constantly spam grenades, which more often hurt themselves or their allies than you. They'll even use missile launchers at point-blank range. Apart from that, expect the traditional tiered bullet sponges system, except for the new bullet sponges that heal to full health when filled with bullets so they can soak up more bullets. These particular bullets sponges drop gear with enchantments. I guess Bethesda decided it would be easier to embrace the crappy MMO-style bullet sponge system by adding more MMO-esque features rather than fix the problem. Speaking of, you can also build settlements now, and they're incredibly mediocre. I can't help but question why they spent all this time on a poorly-interfaced, clunky building system when a player could simply mod in something similar to what they can build much more easily, especially since console players can supposedly use mods now. As for the weapon mods, they've essentially just cut down on the number of unique weapons and replaced them with a system that lets you create military-grade weaponry from tin cans and alarm clocks. Meanwhile, the majority of enemies use guns made out of piping.  I have a lot more that I’d like to say, but I’m already running into the character limit, so to sum up, Fallout 4 is a poor RPG, a poor FPS, and a somewhat decent adventure FPS with RPG elements. Bethesda needs to focus on making the actual game rather than adding gimmicky features like animated vault boys, mini-games like Donkey Kong, a single NPC which says your name, or shallow settlement-building.… Expand "

So it feels that Bethesda, an amazing RPG developer and publisher, now wants to cash grab what they can while putting in minimal effort, and as well as appealing to the least common denominator modern RPGS. Skyrim was similar but at least I felt that it was more appropriate since it's medieval fantasy, so it was like Witcher (I think the Witcher games are some of the best and even comparing it to this feels insulting to me as well, I just can't think of a better analogy at the moment) on a smaller/casual scale with a huge world, Fallout 4 doesn't do anything like that. It took it a step back.  There is no immersion in the game. Bethesda wanted to give the players many choices but in doing so it really redistricts the player further.  They spent too much time of gun customization and settlement building that everything else falls so short or has to revolve around it. I did not buy a Fallout game so I can run around and play Forge from Halo, pick up random wonderglue and desk fans (essentially garbage I would avoid in other games), and having to build a house to keep people out when in the other games you just get one at the start, it is pretty empty but you customize it as you get actual items to put in. I just don't appreciate having this ""forced"" onto me (by that I mean you won't get very far without taking advantage of it. Enemies just become bigger bullet sponges so you have to upgrade your stuff but to get materials in a reliable manner, you gotta take advantage of this mechanic).  The graphics look like it is from the PS3/360 era with severe optimization problems. I could be walking down a road and my foot would get stuck in a crack that looking down, you won't even see it.  The AI are really retarded and you can't kill most of the characters, looking at you Garvey (I think that's his name). By retarded I mean that I can be standing on the top of a hill with a .45 revolver, a raider from the bottom will try to rush me with a stick and doesn't even bother going for cover, just a straight run at me while I put caps in him. Turning the difficulty up doesn't make it any harder really, instead of shooting the raider once or twice, it'll take five or six shots. Essentially a bullet sponge difficulty change.  The questing system is that of an MMORPG. Go to point A, kill or pick up B, return to A, get reward. I can't think of how many quests I did like those. After doing a few side quests, I just gave up on them all together. I am not trying to play a World of Fallout game.  The storyline was a complete letdown. They try to start off strong by taking your son away from you and you begin a quest to traverse the wasteland to find him. But after about 45 min of playtime, the character pretty much forgets about the kidnapped child and is far more interested in looking for fans and glue inside torn down houses. Some of the faction quests are alright but some are buggy so you can just farm infinite experience.  Speaking of leveling, the jack of all trades system that was used in Skyrim was brought back (although it did start in Oblivion but it was still at a minimal back then). There are infinite levels so eventually the character will get all the perks and can do ANYTHING in the game (ex: I can be a super doctor, hacker, lock-picking thief, the hardest hitting melee character while manning chain guns and fire with almost perfect aim, and at the same time have the charisma level of a president). This presents the problem is having very low replay value in it. Like why go back and make a new character when it's going to turn out pretty much exactly the same?  It was also not cool to introduce power armor that early in the game. In all the others, you have to work and go through the training thing to use it.  Pretty bad game, I would not recommend it unless you want Call of Fallout: Modern Post-Apocalyptic Warfare.… Expand "

Then in the same year i got New Vegas. At first i hated the game. but i gave New Vegas another go and i fell in love with it and then i bought the Ultimate edition in 2012 and enjoyed the heck out of it. Then in 2014 i bought these games again in Steam & downloaded mods but honestly i played more Vegas instead and became a Legion Character and played a Survival Hardcore Mod. And then Fallout 1 and 2 along with Tactics jumped into Steam. As a Fan of these series i wanted to try these old school games when i played a bit of Fallout 3 in PC with the Classic Old School Weapons Mod. And Yes i had a Blast with these games. Played Fallout 1 with the Fixt Mod and Fallout 2 Unmodded but then with the Restoration Patch in the 2nd Playthrough as a Female Character. I Love these games and i have yet to complete Fallout Tactics but when Fallout 4 Came out. I was not these people who jump into the Hype train as i watch instead. it turns out the Hype is a bad omen to all of us sadly. Pros 1.Okay Graphics -Graphics i don't care for them as they don't make the games ( Just look at MGS1 at the PSX Bad Graphics Awesome Game! ) well unless you put your eyes into the walls to see muddy textures instead. 2.Weapon Customization -A Huge Step up from New Vegas Weapon Customization as you can throw in a Huge Magazine to your 10mm Pistol and then Turn it into a Machine Pistol with a amazing DPS! Mixed 1.The Removal of Choices and Karma and Reputation. -I Was upset at seeing this and complained at the Steam forums but no avail the people there are very unhelpful as they say it was flawed. yes dammit but they can atleast fix this but removing these takes away the roleplay and choice as i can't play a Evil Character only an Jerk Marty Stu/Mary Sue. as last seen FNV with karma and reputation. 2.No Ammo Swapping -No Armor Piercing. No Hollow Point. No EMP Shotgun Rounds WTH Bethesda!? Oh But you can turn your 10mm Pistol into a Incendiary Firing Pistol with A Weapon Mod. NO! In Bioshock 1 i can switch to 3 types of ammo for my guns. Normal, Armor Piercing for Big Daddies, Anti-Personel for the Splicers. New Vegas i can do these as well to add strategic elements like should i use Normal Bullets or AP on Deathclaws? Why take this away man? now i can't have a Anti-Material Rifle loaded with incendiary or Explosives rounds now. Only some Unique Weapon can do this as i read the Wiki but none for the Combat Shotty :( Hopefully the DLC and the Modding Community will throw these back. 3.The Story -By the Gods it is bad... but its just in the middle of the road. Look i watched a Youtube Lets play and see that... yay family! oh no family got shot by bad guy... and they took the macguffin. its time for revenge! Hell yeah go America! *facepalm* The Fallout series was a deconstruction of war and the use of nuclear weapons and America saves the day in the Fallout universe set in a Alternative Time line. War... War never changes. Fallout was never about America's history it was about Fallout's History. the Minutemen which i wish where optional but nope they force you to join them! BOS Isn't even better either too. There are Plot holes here and there. Why the Hell the Enclave Power armor Mk1 has Mk3 and Mk5?? Deathclaw Chameleons? Wern't they unable to do that? ( could had saved for a special area ) Don't get me started with the Plot twist and the endings because i hate it. Get out of Emil Pagliarulo Stalker... I Wished they had Obsidian do the story because FNV's Story was Very Good and i mean it. Bad 1.Voiced protagonist -I Don't care about people complaining about Silent protagonists but this one is the Worst thing shoehorned into this game! Whats the point? Bethesda only wasted money for this!? now you got limited choices because of this! no more roleplaying and no option to mute the character. I don't care just get a Silent Player Mod instead. 2.Non-killable Characters -In FNV you where almost able to kill everyone. no one is immortal except the kids and the vendertron. Killing everyone including Doc Mitchel. Marcus. Caesar & Mr.House. only leads to Yes man who Respawns and gives you the Wild card path. Heck FO1 & FO2 Even did this! FO4? Can't i kill the minutemen leader instead? Nope Plot Armor! Kill Dogmeat like a cruel monster? NOPE! Even when you kick him out of your party! FNV Yes Companions were essential. but not when they are out of your party or in Hardcore mode where they can die horribly... ED-E NOOOOOOOO!! 3.Limited Dialogue -Yes No. Barter. Sarcasm. Nuff Said. Only 4 Options. *sigh* Thank God i didn't buy this game. to expensive man. i read it. watched it and spoiled it. i still got other bads in this game but i don't care anymore. the more i talk the more i hate this game. I rather play STALKER, Metro 2033, Mad Max, Borderlands, Wasteland and Fallout 1,2,3 & NV instead. Just get Obsidian to work on Fallout Bethesda please.… Expand "

Whether it's a good-hearted individual who just wants to make the wasteland a better place, or an **** who finds joy in killing. The beauty of Fallout 4's successors was that you could make these choices and the consequences would be reflected into the wasteland. Even in the ambitious Fallout 3, which brought Fallout to the 1st person world. The story in Fallout 3 is a good or bad ending, nothing else. It never bothered me, but I still prefer New Vegas' endings I mean the possibilities were endless. Fallout 4 fails in that aim with having copy paste endings (I mean 3 out of 4 are the same), a voiced character which prohibits you to became in full who you wish to be, and a story in which your choices are extremely limited. There is no evil ending, no good ending, only faction endings. This game could have been SO much more, but Bethesda decided to attract new customers with jetpacks, settlements that you can build, and flashy images which give very little to the story. Bethesda screwed up, and threw out the rpg elements which made this series great. It is astonishing that a company who has games like Skyrim and Fallout 3, which are masterpieces (Fallout 3 just has low resolution textures), can throw that out the window in the name of money.… Expand "

The game has plenty of content but the depth of the content is what is missing. And if you didn't play fallout 3 or fallout New Vegas I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand the complaints. The side missions for the most part barring a few fun ones, were repetitive fetch quests or clearing an area. Characters you met used to pop up over and over again, in different creative ways. In fallout 4 you meet a character do a mission or so with them and then their dialog runs out and they just walk around one of your settlements. Like Preston Garvey for example(hardly spoilers, happens within the first few hours of the game), at first you think he'll be a very cool partner as he appoints general of the minutemen a cool seeming questline and faction. Yet in reality he spends most of his time giving you orders and telling you to clean up areas and fix up settlements. A real wasted opportunity I think. And many questlines and factions feel the same way. Everywhere you look in Fallout 4 you see great potential but it just doesn't pan out, almost as if the game was planned to be so much more and wasn't finished. A great example of this is the Ocean. The huge percentage of the map in the game is covered in Ocean, Ocean that literally has practically nothing to do in or on it. Making it feel smaller than Even skyrim in my honest opinion, even it was technically bigger. In the old games you could walk around a city and just talk to random people and find little missions everywhere with so much heart and character in them. Some them felt like long expansive quests, with one quest leading to a whole chain of quests. I can think of so many examples of this.  In fallout New Vegas you walk into an old ratty casino in the broken down poorer part of Vegas, and you chat with the people inside. And this little casino leads to so many quests. Like one where you track down a hilarious male sex robot to bring guests. The same casino lets you go around and collect money from people who owe it. You can even start a quest where you collect stage entertainers, like a stand up comedian and a guitarist who gives you a gun that plays awesome western dual music when you pull it out. And seriously thats just one little building in a game I played years ago and I remember that clearly. I played maybe 20-30 hours of fallout 4 gave it a real chance, and it's just not memorable like its predecessors were.  I could go on and on and on honestly about all the ways that this game just isn't that good. For instance one thing that I really don't like that some of my friends do is the new level up system. I think its boring as you have to spend perk points on normal skills like weapon damage. In the old games your normal stats were separate from  your special perks. YOu always got skill points. And your perk points were dedicated to special abilities. In this game they combined the systems. Leveling up in fallout used to be very fun to me, but I found this new system very boring, bringing an ""oh wow another single perk to put into rifle damage *sarcastic yay*"". And again just another small factor that made me dislike this game. I know Bethesda  I know how awesome their games can be because I've played them, Oblivion(though was too young to be good at/finish it, Skyrim, fallout 3, fallout New Vegas( My personal fav). And thats why I give this a 4/10 because its a bethesda 4/10, below average for what they are capable.  I think that they were trying to balance this game for both the casual audience and the hardcore gamer. While the out fallouts were more for the hardcore gamer. Usually I would be on the casual end, but the quality of old bethesda were so good that I played them like a hardcore gamer, and spent many hours in them something very rare for me.  Without considering the games that came before it I would have given fallout 4 a 7 or 8 out of 10, but that would have been for a new game in a new series. Because you give a series leeway when its just starting out. But I honestly feel that Fallout 3 and New Vegas are better games than this.  Long Story short if you don't have experience with previous fallouts you'll probably like it but eventually you'll get bored and move on. And I suggest that you give the old games a shot if you ever have the time to sit down and play em. So to clarify not a bad game and on some levels its a good game. There are good things about it and I could list those as well. But I can't in good honestly recommend this game full heartedly to gamers, because I just think there are better things to spend your time and money on.  Hopefully I wasn't too harsh, and this in combination with other reviews gave you a good idea of what to expect with Fallout 4. Thanks for reading.… Expand "

The story is poorly written, dull, very little if not non-existent character development, and everything we've come to know and love from Bethesda writing. But seriously, no one bought the damn game for the story anyway. Bethesda did add and improve upon a few things though, although not nearly enough to compensate for all the negatives. The weapons modding/base building system is fun, and helps distract from the lack of variety in the weapons, the power armor is much better, giving a more realistic, slower, clunkier, and stronger feel than those from the other two Fallouts, and the actual combat is probably my favorite out of Vegas and 3. I have encountered very few bugs myself, although I know there are treasure troves of the annoying buggers (I mean come on, this is Bethesda we're talking about).

RPG elements: difficult choices, immersive story line, colorful characters, leveling... it's just not there. There is no depth whatsoever, no purpose. Voice acting seems silly, especially MC's. Side quests are very repetitive, enemies all the same after awhile. This is just an awful game.  Settlement had promise but is just broken. No way, or very hard to say which settler is doing what etc. Very unpolished. I simply cannot believe that they released it like this! Never, ever will I buy an RPG from Bethesda again. Such a shame :(… Expand "

Pro: + Improved gun-play (but points docked for bullet sponge enemies) + Gun customization was a good step in New Vegas and Fallout 4 implements it properly. Being able to alter a lousy sniper rifle to a spear of death is rather gratifying. + Fun settlement mechanics (some points docked for it feeling like a last minute addition rather than being substantial) + Improved Power Armour usage  Flaws - Dialogue system. It is awful here as the decision to give voice acting to the player character winds up limiting dialogue options down to 4 that are usually lead to the same outcome. There are too few dialogue options that radically alter the sequences of events after. Also, whoever thought that brief descriptions of dialogue options was a good idea should be shot or given a broken nose because words like sarcastic or mere one liners do not convey enough about the intent or tone of the dialogue option. I will pick a sarcastic response sometimes only to have it progress the dialogue and making me sound like a complete **** without lasting effect on the other NPCs.  It does not help that the only relevant stat to have for dialogue is charisma now unlike previous games that had skill checks to deliver differing results. This is Fallout 4's biggest misstep for me as a good part of the Fallout series involves dialogue with other NPCs with the potential of changing the outcome (this is the series known for being able to talk down the final bosses). - No real role-playing potential as a result of the dialogue system. The problem with the dialogue system and the lack of consequences is that the protagonist only comes across as a yes man with varying degrees of acceptance towards his position in life. - Main story being lackluster is typical of Bethesda games and Fallout 4 is one of these games. The initial premise and motivator for the story starts out engaging but loses focus when the open world comes it. Since your character has some form of personality due to unprompted dialogue, it is rather jarring to see him forget his main goal to start a farm. The end game is a complete mess of quests for dull and underdeveloped factions (save for one pre-existing group) since it is possible to end-up as friends of 4 factions that oppose each other somehow (rather than New Vegas's well-implemented faction system) - Lousy companion AI and far too few companion quests. The number of times Preston and Dogmeat have ruined my stealth runs by moving too close to enemies, blocking my shots or triggered traps will take a calculator to fully quantify. It does not help that only a few of these companions will have quests to begin with which keeps people invested in keeping them around. - The removal of skill trees for redundant perks. This is most prominent in the perk for unlocking advanced locks or hacking advanced terminals. The perk simply exists to substitute these removed skills. They do allow for more specialized characters though so it's not all bad. Just disappointing due to the redundant additions. - Overly rapid progression (especially with loot) in the game. After the first 1-3 hours, you will start off with Power Armour and a minigun. You then kill a late game deathclaw with your equipment. 3-7 hours later after exploring, you will find a Fat Man/Missile Launcher with more than enough legendary gear to keep you in the game for a long time. I think Bethesda forgot about gradual progression here. - Poor graphics for a 2015 triple-A release. When certain textures resemble textures from Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 3, something has gone wrong somewhere. Also, lip sync is both terrible and horrifying (Piper's gaping abyss haunts my nightmares). Nice weather effects though. - Bugs that pop up too often should stop being a typical thing in a Bethesda game. We should stop giving Bethesda a free pass so often especially when their official fixes take a long time to be implemented and more reliance is placed on independent modders instead. If they could not play-test enough to catch these bugs, at least respond to these issues as quickly as companies like CD Projekt Red who gave pretty quick responses to bugs in Witcher 3. My own list of bugs includes slow switching of weapons with hotkeys, invisible guns when switching at times, crazy ragdoll physics with corpses (corpses should not be capable of doing a horizontal Cossack dance), disappearing textures, companions being incapable of going back to their original home bases, and an occasional hard crash to desktop. - Dull sidquests with few locations.  While the game is fun and will probably fill up your time, it does not really pay off like a Fallout game should. Bethesda really dropped the ball here when making a Fallout game but at least made an okay gam… Expand "

I think it's heart and soul, but from how I've seen Todd Howard acting about it, I don't think that could be it; but it certainly feels that way.  The game is ambitious, I'll give it that, but it doesn't fully realize any of it's ambitions. For instance: Settlement Creations- Feels like a rushed concept, it's unappealing, and pretty difficult to work with. It is, by no means, a requirement, but Bethesda sure talked it up a lot.  Weapon Modding- Cool concept, but poorly executed. Having to hunt for scrap items with screws in the wasteland is just as annoying as it sounds, and the entire system pretty much boils down into being a chore.  Dialogue- A partially interesting concept, and it is acted out rather well, but it deeply takes away from the RPG characterization. Not that this game is much of an RPG to begin with. The fact that there is only one voice selection per gender is seriously annoying as well.  Despite this stuff, it does do a few good things. The gunplay is extensively improved, there are a lot of companions to choose from (But ""Leveling' them with weapons and armor is nearly inexistent, at least in my experience) and it still has an open world to explore. The game is fun more often than it is not, I'll give it that.  I despise the leveling system. In a massive gutting of RPG elements, Bethesda decided to remove stats, and replace them solely with perks. It's a pretty annoying system- especially when it comes to crafting weapons and armor.  Overall, the game isn't bad, but it certainly isn't the effigy of greatness we were promised, and is more than a bit disappointing.

Ourlig,"Nov 20, 2015",5,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I just finished Fallout 4 and it's almost funny how it reminds me of Fallout 3. To sum it up, OK Game, BAD Fallout. It's a bit like going to the movie expecting to see an Indiana Jones Movie and ending up watching the mummy (or Indy 4, for that matter). It is fun at times but it's clearly not what I could expect from the franchise  The things I liked : - The story is a bit bland but looking for your kidnapped infant is a much better reason to explore the world than trying to catch up with your lousy father so I would give the game a free pass. - The building part is fun. it's not why i played the game but I can see the appeal. - So is the shooting part. Even if I suck at FPS and didn't buy the game for that. - The overall design of the Wasteland has improved. There are a lot of locations with a real, unique atmosphere. - the weapon and armor customization. Even if the main reason for it in the first place has disappeared (no more damaging for equipment), it is still fun to improve (and even name) your favorite weapons. - The legendary items : fun to collect until you realize your common items are good enough for the job anyway  The things that annoyed me : - The wheel speech. The fact that you only have 4 different things available to say is annoying but to me, the real RPG-feeling killer is that you don't know exactly what your character will say. so you spin the wheel hoping the end result will be good. - The key map. more specifically the fact that one key might do the exact opposite of you're expecting simply because you're in a different menu. - The control over companions or should I say the complete lack of it. Even in 3, you were able to ask a companion to switch from ranged to melee. Now you can romance them. Great ... - the non-existent optimization for PC. Seriously. It's a port (and a rather bad one). otherwise I just can't explain why my PC, despite the fact that it is technically better than a PS4, can only run the game with graphics set on Low (so without any sort of anti-aliasing... in 2016) - One common rant is about the acting. Believe me, the English version is FINE, The French one, on the other end, is just horrendous. Bad lip sync, bland acting... it is just pure crap. I switched to English as soon as I realized it was possible. (Thank you steam)  The real problems : - the general dumbing down. Forget everything you learned in the previous game. No enemy should be a real challenge. Super Mutants used to be a deadly threat but since 3, we all know they are a joke. But then Bethesda created the Behemoth. Now, you might not be able the one shot kill them, but a couple of well placed shots will do the trick... as for Deathclaws... they were dangerous. something to treat with caution even for a well prepared end-gamer (especially when found in packs). Now you almost HAVE to kill one in your first hour outside the vault. But don't panic, Bethesda made sure you will have the infinity-1 sword so you can kill it... So the real danger is humanity except it's not raiders, coursers, even power-armor paladins are a joke - The quests, secondary or not, are almost exclusively fetch ones. And most of the time, you will have to kill everything in the locations to get it - at this point, I don't even want to talk about the biggest problem, the biggest betrayal to the fallout spirit : the new perk system that turn every thing into a perk. Building your character up is not a hard choice anymore. So I don't see why I would even try a rerun. Pity… Expand "

The game looks to be on the quality level of Skyrim, but that's about par for the course.  Skyrim was never the most gorgeous game, but is workable for what it is.  Sound is a bit improved, especially in the area of voice acting.  Bethesda went out of its way to hire more voice actors and more lines for these characters to say in the background, but it's not really there for story purposes, it's all for ambiance.  Music is a down here.  The original soundtrack is passable, but not memorable.  What is truly awful is the radio.  The majority of the soundtrack from Fallout 3 is re-used, added mostly to by royalty free song tracks that were included in fan-made addons for 3/New Vegas.  This is a let-down as you either get 30s/40s/50s era song tracks mixed with heavy-handed atomic-themed songs from that era as well, and nothing that would add to the ambiance of a nuclear Boston.  Mechanics-wise, in an effort to garner interest and familiarity to a broader gaming audience, Fallout 4 has attempted to improve and simplify it's interface by taking elements from other games and applying it here.  The result is a mixed bag that relies on systems that are not conducive to a good roleplaying game.  It wants to be New Vegas, Mass Effect, Destiny, and others, but doesn't quite stick the landing or hold to a coherent, meaningful narrative.  The gunplay is much more polished than previous games, taking a lot of inspiration from Bungie's Destiny game to improve the combat.  The result is a much more polished than previous Fallout games.  However, it is combined with a crafting system that is not nearly as useful as it wants to be.  The modular approach to the crafting system is quite underwhelming.  While each weapon type is given enough work that they are different, each individual weapon does not really feel more than cosmetically different than another.  Armor is similar to weapons.  It's mostly modular parts you strap to yourself, and allows for a bit more personal customization, but it's ultimately mostly cosmetic.  Power Armor is a new system and adds a new experience, but ultimately falls on its face.  It does feel much more like a vehicle, but at the same time, it's given so early and so easily, it never feels like an accomplishment to use.  The biggest change, and the most polarizing mechanic, is the settlement building system.  Clearly inspired by building games like Minecraft, it does add a system for building your own bases and settlements by collecting resources and using those to make houses and defenses for people to live in your settlements.  Much of the DLC for Fallout 4 is based around this system.  Unfortunately, this mechanic was said to be not required to play Fallout 4, but it is absolutely required to be used in order to progress through the central storyline.  Companions in Fallout 4 are nothing to write home about.  They are better than Fallout 3's companions, but not as nuanced as New Vegas.  They are not tied to factions, but rather the player's actions.  It is possible to completely ignore your companion's reactions and still achieve the best reputation with them.  The dialogue wheel comes straight from other, more tightly written games such as Mass Effect or TellTale's Walking Dead.  It is also combined with a voiced protagonist.  This is not an improvement, as the ""do anything you want"" approach of previous games is tossed out the window for poorly written dialogue where players do not really know what they are going to say.  This new dialogue system works much better in a structured story like the above examples of Mass Effect or Walking Dead, but doesn't quite very well in Fallout 4.  The dialogue system is further hampered by the story, which is one of the worst parts of Fallout 4.  A lot of 4's story is reused from 3.  The central plot involves running across the wasteland to find a missing family member, and it requires dealing with three different organizations in order to find a solution to the overall Wasteland problem.  Each of the three main factions are unique and at odds with each other in one way or another, but unfortunately, they are not very deeply written or convincing.  What really hurts Fallout 4 is that there are so many radiant quests, and so few storytelling quests, that you never get to know these groups.  There are very few character-building quests tied to these groups that you never get to know what the stakes are for each faction.  As such, the repetitive radiant quests are boring filler, and really just takes up time.  It doesn't help your understanding of the factions, nor is it interesting enough to be rewarding.… Expand "

The 'cover system' doesn't really work even with mods so basically all they did was add the sprint feature that modders made for New Vegas, and made free aiming relatively workable.  You still can't direct your squad, who also fail at stealth.  You're locked into being a particular character that you can't really put yourself into, or decide who they are beyond being nice, sarcastic, or just an jerk.  The dialogue is so simplistic that it offers no real choice, nor do any of the quests beyond which hollow, incoherent, and ultimately uninteresting faction you'll side with for the main quest.  They literally give you the same quests but only change out which faction you're representing during, over and over again, while giving you side quests that are almost indistinguishable from the endless stream of procedurally generated ""radiant quests"".  Overall the writing quality is so low one would almost think they decided to rip off Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel, aka the worst one in the franchise, this time around instead of the first two games like they did with Fallout 3.  Which may be why you get a brief one size fits all ending, for the main quest and ending slideshow.  All in all the game is painfully short, unless you want to play the crappiest version of minecraft ever.  It has the world's worst user interface, and practically zero integration into the rest of the game.  It doesn't even have a point.  Either you ignore it, or it becomes a chore because your settlers are useless.  It also requires you treat the game like an MMO.  Which you already kind of have to, what with the grinding and endless farming required to even get halfway to max level and acquire the best gear.  Thus exacerbating the hoarding requirements of the last two games, and utterly destroying any notion of prudently managing an inventory of scarce items.  Thankfully they saw fit to replace the dozens of fun weapons and armor combos with tiered versions of the five things worth using.  Oh yes, the touted crafting system basically just involves making slightly better versions of a scope, a barrel, a grip, and every other component instead of being able to optimize it for your playstyle.  Being that only one combination is actually worth using.  Especially when you consider the stupid legendary system which means you have to rely entirely on luck to get what you need.  Have fun getting 80 different legendary versions of the crappiest weapons in the game.  Their effects kind of break immersion, which is also a critical flaw of the game.  There are too many continuity errors and nonsensical things to ever properly immerse yourself (you can just straight up craft turrets and generators instantaneously), even before you get to the boring plot and one dimensional characters.  The setting is so bland and repetitive that even the standout locations are mostly too boring to explore, and when you bother you find yourself disappointed.  The radio is even more repetitive than before because they recycled a bunch of songs, and largely lacks the interesting commentary on your quests that we saw in the previous two games.  The ecosystem still makes no sense, and just gradually becomes overrun with the strongest enemy types because apparently every Bethesda Fallout game takes place during a mass extinction event.  They scrapped the repair system, and made the one thing that was supposed to be insanely durable require constant maintenance.  Overall it doesn't inspire me whatsoever.  It contains no dreamfuel, like the previous games where you'd wonder about the possibilities, the lore and history of the Fallout world.  Partly because what they present to you is barely half finished, and the rest of it lacks any depth.  It's decent if you only play it once, never complete it, and constantly adjust the difficulty settings/mod it to death because it has no sense of scaling.  It doesn't really qualify as a Fallout game.… Expand "

It really is something of a travesty when a company like Bethe$da is raking in the money with these so-called ""AAA"" titles while the likes of Obsidian who seem to have a much better idea of what constitutes a great CRPG game have to use Kickstarter to fund their projects.… Expand "

As you developed and moved along the Wasteland it felt like it was changed/shaped by the choices you made.  It felt like you were truly the force behind the story line.  Furthermore, in past Fallout games, the factions and NPCs both individually and their interplay amongst each other was complex and interesting.  Here in Fallout 4 unfortunately Bethesda drops the ball and one is not left with the same level of attachment and volition.  The factions and the NPC's seem sadly two dimensional and bland - the story line linear.  Your interactions with them were furthermore hindered by a new system where you are given only a few words for each response choice.  Once you clicked on it the voice over actor would delver them - often to my chagrin to find that the delivery was different than what you thought - be it sarcastic, mean or positive.  Tasks/Quests were often repetitive - mostly around killing NPC bad guys.  The endings were what made me the most angry.  I felt like I was slapped in the face, wasting a few hundred hours of my time playing only to be forced into a very unsatisfying conclusion. Crafting settlements was a nice addition but this became repetitive quickly.  Furthermore, with poor physics/manipulation capabilities around trying to align objects became very frustrating.  You lost hours trying to get things set up/aligned.  The positives, while annoying due to shabby physics/manipulation, crafting settlements was fun.  The ability to craft/customize your weapons was a nice addition.  Combat - while not stellar is better than in previous releases.  The mobile device addition to off load the Pip Boy worked well.  When you create Fallout 3 and Fallout 3 New Vegas (tip the hat to Obsidian on the latter) and you have such a dedicated fan base who makes mods - you need to step up your game.  Fallout 4 is a disappointment.   Hopefully the fan base will create awesome mods to save the day going forward.… Expand "

I am very depressed to say so. The game starts out so promising, but it has enough bugs to qualify as a species of beetle, terrible graphics which are somehow simultaneously poorly optimized,  and simply isn't worth the money you pay for it unless you plan on running it on Medium settings; this game was built for consoles and runs best on your computer if your computer is forcibly ran like a console. If you have an old computer, this is the game for you. If you have a post 2013 computer, don't even buy this game unless you want the graphics falling apart every 15 minutes. The company which made this game will not care to update its large list of problems and modders so far have been incapable of fixing them either. Worst of all is the fact that the hardest difficulty is unplayable because of the amount of bugs in the game. You NEED the game console to play the game because the console is a debugger and is used to fix bugs, but on the hardest difficulty, they remove the console from the game so you can't use it to fix bugs. Playing on survival mode is a DEATH warrant which will lead to endless frustration. The game is a 0/10 on Survival mode and 3/10 because they have other modes you can play on.  So, to reiterate: 1. 2013+ computer? Don't buy. 2. Always play on the hardest difficulty? Don't buy.  I'd price this game at $0 if you have a newer computer and/or always play the hardest difficulties on games. $10 if you can stand crappy graphics and any difficulty below Survival.  I would give it a higher rating if I knew Bethesda were working on fixing this game's huge list of problems, but they are not working on it because they have already made a lot of money and have no reason to fix old issues, even though the problems are so deep that modders cannot pick up Bethesda's slack this time.  Do not buy, do not waste your time, force Bethesda to at least put in some effort on Fallout 5. We know there will be a Fallout 5 as long as there are idiots who buy crappy games like Fallout 4.

F4 introduces sprinting from Skyrim where you have stamina which is tied to action points, so now if you want to get somewhere fast, be careful, because you might run into enemies and you won't be able to use VATS. Is this a joke? You've made a short game, so you've added sh***y sprinting that ends every 10 seconds? Where's the running from F3 or NV? Where you would press capslock and the character would always run without getting tired? The other thing missing is the ""move button"". In F3/NV you would press ""q"" and the character would move on its own. Well, you won't find this in F4. Thank you Bethesda... remind me to never buy anything from you ever again. But that's not the end of BRILLIANT changes. Remember VATS? Well, now it doesn't stop time. It just slows it down and if you won't make your decisions quickly enemies will hit you. WTF is this again? Why am I being rushed? I always loved the VATS in previous games, you could just relax, choose what body part you want to shoot, maybe drink some tea in meantime, while watching how enemies get torn into pieces. Well now that's gone, thank you Bethesda. You know what's not gone? Bugs. I played the GOTY edition with all the patches. I managed to fall under the world map 8 times. Not kidding. Every bug you saw in Fallout 3 is here again. Hmm I wonder why... maybe because it's the same engine just with a different name. You almost fooled me Bethesda... almost. So, we've established it's the same engine, but you know what's not the same? The requirements. I'm not a type of person, that cares about graphics, but if your game has such big requirements, I'd like to see better graphics. Instead we have sh***y graphics that require a huge PC to run, which is a joke. The optimalization doesn't exist in F4. This game should be able to run on a 1-core 1gb ram 512mb graphic card setup on ultra with 60 frames per second, because it looks like the game was made for such build. But who cares, right? Surely Bethesda doesn't. Let's move on to more funny stuff. The stuff that was the core of NV, F1 & 2, even F3. It's the quests. In previous games, they were more open, we had a few routes to complete them and usually you had a choice how to lead the quest and how it would end. Well forget all about it. Welcome to the ""rpg"" game where most of the missions are ""go talk to someone, he'll tell you what/who to kill, do that, come back, here's your f***ing payment, now get lost"". Yep, welcome to Commonwealth. The most funny stuff when it comes to the quests is Preston. He will harass you and talk about ""another settlement needs your help"". Then he'll mark the location of the settlement on your map and I don't even wanna know how many types of these missions are out there, because I maybe did 4 and all of them were the same. Someone is attacked, you must go and get rid of the problem and do it all over again someplace else. This is insanity. It's what Vass warned us about. The main story wasn't bad, but it also wasn't good. From characters, I really liked Nick Valentine and Piper. I also remember the dog who probably had more charisma than most of the npcs in the game. But in the end the story gets wrecked, because the game forbids us from making our own decisions. This is NOT New Vegas. There are two endings for the game and they both suck. You will not be able to make peace with all the factions, which is ridiculous. Also, if the game establishes that people can send their minds into synths and live in their robot-like bodies, then why would we care about anyone dying especially at the Institute. Logic is not something you will find in this story, which is hilarious, because the game literally focuses on science. This is what happens when you let fake gorillas write your script. So the story is a let down, there is almost none rpg elements left, the shooting is okay, but Fallout isn't supposed to be an fps game. Doom, Blood, Serious Sam, Quake, Painkiller are FPS and they do it well, F4 doesn't. They've also added crafting tools and emphasis on building your base and upgrading it. This might be the worst thing in the game. I don't want Minecraft in Fallout. This is tedious. To build something you will have to acquire items, so everything that is based around the settlements will include going somewhere and finding the tools you need to build the stuff you need to build. It's just a big waste of time and making this a center of your game was a big mistake. So, what's good in Fallout 4? Not much, mostly a few quests and some characters. Don't waste your money or time on this game. Life is not eternal and there's no afterlife. Spend your days on something worth your while. Pickens condemns!… Expand "
Crazyferret,"Jun 15, 2016",4,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          At first I was excited to play a new Fallout. I thought it looked amazing and the gunplay was good. As I kept playing though, I found that was about it. I saw that it was actually very shallow and became boring quickly.  The voiced character is a mistake in my opinion, as it really restricts the dialogue. The dialogue choices rarely even mattered. For example, in the quest The whole yes, sarcastic (yes), No (yes), speech check (yes) is very true. Really makes the choices seem worthless, and they certainly are most of the time.  The story wasn't really good. It came down to two things. They want you to care about this story by making you chase after a son you don't get to know. They make it seem like the story is urgent while wanting you to explore. Quest weren't that great either. some were interesting, but most fell flat. A lot ended with just killing everything in a certain area. Lots of unnecessary radiant quests that add nothing. Places you clear out will just spawn more raiders or super mutants for you to kill for your next quest.  The roleplaying aspect is severely crippled. You don't get to build your own character but play their character. The voiced dialogue is part of the problem. You are always going to be the concerned parents. You aren't really able to be evil so much as just an **** sometimes. If you want to play like the exact character you are given, then you'll be okay. Anything else just doesn't fit. Really kills replayability. Fallout has always been about making your own character and acting like that character would. That shouldn't be taken away from a Fallout game or open world sandox RPGs.  Fallout games should be a RPG first and a shooter second. This game is a FPS first with leveling and some perks on the side, and most of that seems meaningless anyway. It's closer to Farcry than previous Fallout games. The leveling doesn't have a cap, so you will get all the perks at some point. Skills were removed and SPECIAL is the only thing that affects stats, but you can max these out as well. Many of the perks are damage buffs, crafting, skills like lockpicking/hacking, and useless ones like less rads from food (which cooking removes from most things.) Weapons seem to be more important than anything else. I played on survival (the original with the bulletsponge enemies) without taking the damage buff perks for weapon, and I had no problems. the RPG elements are minimal and take a backseat to the gunplay.  That's just a few things I found wrong. I've already rambled so I'll give my finale review.  TL;DR Very dissapointing. Seems fun at first until you get into it. If you want Fallout, this isn't it. If you want an RPG, this isn't. If you want to go around shooting thing in an open-world FPS with some quests and a small story, then this is an okay game for that.

The gameplay isn't much different from Fallout 3. You go out and kill everything in sight, collect and loot everything down to the last spoon and tin can. Both Skyrim and Oblivion and FO3 had the same. You spend half of your gameplay staring at your inventory and trying to decide what to keep, what to throw away.  You can write this in stone: Your inventory will be full almost all the time. We have all got to this in Oblivion and Skryim and FO3 too. The engine has familiar downfalls, that Bethesda was never able to conquer over 2 decades. Anyone, who played Oblivion or Skyrim immediately feel right at home, regarding the problematic areas of this open world engine. If an NPC attacking a hostile NPC..you can't really do anything.  VATS help but you gonna end up shooting your friendly too. Getting into a conversation while others pushing you around is annoying. Sometimes it's hard to initiate a conversation, because the NPC is trying to walk away or turn away. Sometimes you are ""stuck"" in a conversation and you keep turning around, even if you are happened to be under attack. This is all familiar. Strange physics sometimes ...things can get stuck in other objects and shake violently. The crafting mechanics is good...this is surely adding some extra gameplay no doubt. The menus and the interface is awful. This is worse than Skyrim. There is no way to have a clear well categorized menu option for the items. Especially when transfering . It's hard to tell what is worth to pick up. Surely, this game has the most horrendous menu system I have ever seen. Imagine 200-300 items you look through..and it's in line..like in a notepad format and you barely get any clue about what is what or which is better. Now, imagine, you have to look through over and over, as you pick up new things.  Assigning to numbers while keeping an eye on your type of ammo and the amount, it gets really old an annoying. Even if you don't want to, you gonna end up carrying 7-8 types of weapons, because they all need different ammo. 7-8 types of weapons with multiple configurations...it gets really confusing and wasting a lot of time, due to the menu system being so inefficient and unnecessarily hard to sort.  Imagine, if they would have just a copy of a spreadheet from Excel, that would have been a 100 times better. That's how awful it is.  Missions. If you have played FO3 or Skyrim, well you gonna feel right at home. Go here, kill them, come back. Go there kill them, come back. You get the idea. The new recruiting stations is a good idea though. Once you figure out the - once again- God awful menu system, you gonna be building bases and managing the people you recruited. It's a good way to break up the monotone fetch and loot missions. Also, it's gonna take several hours, until you figure out how things work with the crafting and building..since there is hardly any explanation for anything. You either watch youtube videos, or you just go on and you figure it out as you play. It will take several hours. It took me several hours, but i also didn't watch any youtube videos, neither read any guides. I'm still not entirely know everything, even after 15 hours, I have questions regarding buildings, bases, crafting. Despite the good entertainment value and refreshing extra elements, I can't give more than 5. The bugs and glitches remain, the structure of the missions remain, the repetition and garbage collecting remain, just as it was in FO3, Skryim or Oblivion.

Bethesda are hypocrites. This game ain't part of the Fallout series. If they would have called it like Bloodshed in the Commonwealth, an action-adventure game in the Fallout univverse, I would have given this game a 10 / 10, it would have been a kickass FPS with adventure elements on top of the building of bases.  Speaking of building bases/hamlets, this aspect of the game is completly useless. Nothing happens with these communities aside from random ""go kill X to protect Y"" missions. No missions to improve the community, no internal strife, no seek out new colonists for this hamlet, nothing!  Bethesda has missed the mark for sure. They call this game Fallout 4, but it has nothing of the series aside from the game world. At least the old company had the intelligence of naming their game another way when they tried something else when Fallout Tactics came out. They did not called it Fallout 3.  They spent too much time and money on graphics and not enough on the game itself. And don't tell me and others that this was what the fans wanted, that is total BS! We want a game like Fallout 1, 2 or New Vegas, at the limit like Fallout 3, but that game was too linear and I won't play anymore.

calderra,"Nov 25, 2015",0," Garbage. The only people who like this game are people who still think loot boxes are okay, seriously.  The story? The entire emotional setup of the opening chapter lasts about 30 seconds, so by the time the ""big plot event"" happens you barely have any idea who these characters are and you certainly don't have any reason to care about them. No build-up, no payoff.    The RPG mechanics?Garbage. The only people who like this game are people who still think loot boxes are okay, seriously.  The story?

No build-up, no payoff.  The RPG mechanics? Hilariously bad. I hadn't been sufficiently warned by other reviews so here's the deal. You only get a few points to put into your SPECIAL stats at the start. This is because at any level up, you can put that point into any SPECIAL stat- OR IN ANY PERK IN THE ENTIRE TREE! This means that by Level 3 you could already have every single perk you really need for a super-overpowered build that will destroy combat for the rest of the game. In older fallouts, many perks were gated by level or by other perks so you had to build things on top of each other. That system was way more rewarding. Like the plot there's no build-up, so there's no pay-off. You don't feel like you earned anything on the entire tree- because you can get the ""best"" perk in the game at Level 1. Seriously.  The shooting mechanics? This engine is old, ugly, buggy, and clunky. There's not getting around this. So even though the shooting is much more like ""Caller Doody"" than in past entries, it's still bad. So they sacrificed all the RPG elements, for mediocre-at-best- shooting. Not worth it.  The time sinks? Base building / settlements are an MMO-style time sink. You really have to look up tips online for almost everything because the interface is awful and poorly described in-game. The materials are absolutely a time-waster. Trying to craft settlements, weapons, and armor will add literally tens of hours to your game- not by increasing the fun you'll have- but by making you pick up every freaking thing you run across to throw it into the recycling bin and turn it into crap. Bo-ring. Luckily, you can skip almost all of it. Deposit your normal armloads of crap into the bin, and combined with the easy game and overpowered perk system, you don't really have to worry about crafting good stuff to complete the game. Ever.  The settlements? I'm not doing them except for the main story. Period. It's absolute bullcrap MMO-style time sinks. And the system behind the settlements is useless- anyone who actually cares about this part of the game has to mod it heavily to make it behave in a sane way. Short version- even if you arm your best settlement with way too many defenses, the game caps out at something like 80% chance they'll lose when they get attacked. It's stupid. There is no point.  The business practices? Creation club is horrible business. They tried to make you pay money for community-developed mods. So people in the community improve the game, and Bethesda wants to profit off them. Absolutely greedy.  Worst entry in the Fallout series, save for the ""Fallout Shelter"" mobile game. It's that bad. Do not buy at full price, ever. Maybe worth $15 if you're a hardcore fan. But 5 minutes in you may get a loading screen that spoils the biggest reveal in the entire plot since they're randomized. Non-spoiler.. the ""new kind of robot"" in the game was my second-ever loading screen. Now the whole second half of the game is spoiled for me. Who the hell decided that was okay?… Expand "

And while Bethesda was busy with selling more ""content"" through a few half-finished DLCs, modders did the heavy lifting by providing the community with inofficial bug fixes, mods that improved the gameplay a lot, and in some cases even mods that could stand right beside any of the official DLCs. Instead of supporting those modders with some kind of recognition, Bethesda chosed to release the ""Creation Club"" for Fo4, which is nothing else then a rather tasteless atempt on trying to cash in on all the work the modders did for the game. The Creation Club isn't an option like any other paid DLC, it's forced upon every player instead, there is currently no official way to uninstall the CC and then play Fo4 as we were used to. A future update for the CC will probably get rid of the paid mods archives, but in the end, we'll still have to download every update for the CC that pushes another round of paid mods into the game. And those paid mods are really expensinve... and of course filled with bugs and issues like the game itself. So much for their advertised ""quality control"". Not to mention that this first update and installment of CC even broke free mods in the process, and that this will probably happen again with the next patch too. My guess, this is only the beginning, at some point they will probably turn the Creation Club into a Gatekeeper program for all mods, and you won't be able to use mods that aren't on their ""list"".… Expand "

The following is a short list of why Fallout 4 is a terrible game. 1) Same bugged game engine as Fallout 3, & Fallout NV.  All Bethesda has done was add on to the game engine to support Fallout 4, they still have not bothered to fix the Crashing to Desktop, Hard Lock Up Crashes, and lagging issues. 2) Broken Lore, Examples : T-60 power armor, and Jet. To name two, many more exist. 3) Lack of choice, bad dialogue, bad writing, and ripping out the SKILLs system, replacing it with just Perks, that are mostly useless. 4) Weapons, are mostly the same, Combat Rifle, Combat Shotgun,  Combat Sniper Rifle, all the same look, and Sounds are all the same, Laser and Plasma Rifles that sound like a ballistic weapon.

Fallout 4 is the worst Fallout game in the series, and that is saying something since I do own every single game in the series with the acception of Fallout 4, which I played on a friends gaming PC.

The Commonwealth looks closer to a particularly bad Earthquake than it does a living world 210 years after global nuclear apocalypse and also need I mention, TWO HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS. Brick and wood houses are still standing, bottles are still upright, skeletons are still boning it up and clothed, .. there's a lot of little problems like this.  It seems, again, Bethesda's design really was thinking a world 5 or maybe 10 after the bomb, but wanted to have a time frame including the events of the first two Fallouts when designing Fallout 3. So this is a holdover  The gameplay isn't really good. I do admit, I had some fun early on walking through the world conserving power armor energy, praying my next encounter would yield a fusion core. Popping out to snipe targets and stealth around, running back to the frame when I got caught. This worked, this was fun for a while.  But then it just got too easy. By the time I had met the Brotherhood proper, I had 37 fusion cores, combat had gotten laughably easy despite me leveling non combat, social and settlement traits and having a charisma/int build.  I couldn't find a single enemy worth cheesing or even cheating over and I know all the console commands. And I was still 21 levels from the goddamn jet pack. Oh and the writing was making it clear it wasn't going to get better on a storytelling or characterization front. I cannot believe how bad the main character is and how dumb and hysterical. Your lines are terrible. the dialog wheel choices are worse than Mass Effect, often don't matter or make no sense, and they rarely lead to different outcomes. This becomes extremely blatant if you get a ""full dialog choice"" mod and you can actually see what you'll say. Or more often they just railroad you into their outcome after a snide remark.  I am tired of ranting so I am just going to say I cannot believe this is in the same family tree as Fallout 1 and 2. I am aghast. They were roleplaying games in the original sense. You could design a character, your character, and you had so many more ways to be it.  Now what do we have? This is pretty much the same plot line as Fallout 3, only this time the guy with the beard and white lab coat is technically your son, but they still call him father. Man I don't even know the ethos and doctrine of the Institute, and I just did their questline.. aye yai yai.  I know and understand the Master's points and maneuvers. I get Gizmo's philosophy even if i disagree with it. I understand the FO1 Brohood and sympathize with them, even if they are wrong. Even the Vault City and the Enclave from FO2 make sense, although they are evil.

Fallout 4 does not improve on these flaws, only worsening them to appeal to a broader market. Areas to explore all feel the same, the majority of quests are quite forgettable, and the biggest flaw of all - the dialogue. The dialogue has been limited to four choices per dialogue event, with the majority of the time the answers being ""Yes"", ""Sarcastic yes"", ""F***k you"", and ""Tell me more"". While the gameplay has been improved, the extremely dated engine limits how much fun can be had just as a shooter.

Navigating through menus and lists is a massive pain in the a$$, everything you want to do takes many, many actions.

Just stupid.  Example 2: comparing armor / weapons  when you highlight another weapon in your inventory, a ""comparison"" will be performed against your currently equipped weapon.  A NORMAL UI would either display the stats of both items or the offset (e.g. +5 dmg, -7 accuracy etc).

BathroomSync,"Dec 18, 2015",3," Fallout 4 is a slap in the face to those who have cherished the series for its amazing narrative and attention paid to player freedom.

It doesn't allow you to flesh-out your character with an intuitive skill system likeFallout 4 is a slap in the face to those who have cherished the series for its amazing narrative and attention paid to player freedom.  Fallout 4 places you into the shoes of one of two predetermined characters and pulls you through a shallow narrative in which you have an abysmal impact on the world. It doesn't allow you to flesh-out your character with an intuitive skill system like previous games, and after reaching maximum level, literally every character will play the same. You don't have to carefully invest skill points to tailor your character to your play style.  The dialog system is a disaster. Bethesda coded themselves into a wall by making it so that the conversation UI only allows for four options. That often means that you don't have enough things to say, or you have four ways of saying the exact same thing. Skill checks are gone. In their place is an occasional RNG persuasion option that is affected by your charisma, but it's pointless due to the fact that you can quicksave and quickload during conversations, so you can just keep reloading until you get the outcome you desire.  Fallout 4's graphics are really poor for 2015. The world is dull, the textures are muddy (moreso due to the poor quality than the presence of actual mud), and human characters look like they're made of clay and plastic. Even worse, it runs quite poorly, in spite of its low fidelity. Bloated texture files and poorly-optimized lighting and shadows are mainly to blame. Also, the engine is running on outdated code with a few recent additions. It may as well be a modded Morrowind engine. Actually, that's literally what it is.  Fallout 4 focuses more on maintaining a repetitive gameplay loop than good storytelling and characterisation. Most of the quests just boil down to ""go there, shoot the enemies, grab something"". Most of the locations in the game are just full on enemies. There aren't many towns because of the settlement system, and when you make some towns, they're never full of interesting characters. It even throws out the idea that Power Armour is rare by having it randomly spawn in the wasteland, PLUS giving a full set of it to players within the first hour of gameplay. Power armour is no longer a powerful late-game item, it's just another game mechanic now. People seem to praise the combat mechanics, even though they're just passable at best. There are no different ammo types for each weapon, and there is a small variety of weapons. Sure, there's a lot of weapon customisation, but it's mostly just linear upgrading and doesn't allow for very unique weapons.  Now, about the weapons, so many of the designs make no sense. First, they're all left-handed. The bolts and ejection ports are all on the left sides of the guns, so the hot spent casings just fly in front of your face. Second, the assault rifle and combat rifle are really poorly thought-out. The assault rifle is extremely bulky and looks more like a LMG. The combat rifle has an extremely similar model to the combat shotgun and uses .45 rounds. That's a pistol caliber, not a rifle caliber. The lever-action rifle in Far Harbour is really weird. It has a magazine capacity of five rounds, but when you fire two of them and hit your reload key, the character shoves five back in every time and works the lever, ejecting a live round from the chamber. Even Obsidian was able to avoid this in New Vegas. They had to jury-rig the engine to do it, but they made sure that the courier only reloads as many rounds as he or she needs to.  The institute weapons are bad as well. The models are massive and take up a whole third of your screen. They do abysmal damage for laser weapons made by the most technologically advanced faction in the game. They were also designed so that Bethesda could re-use the regular laser weapon animations, which is really lazy when you think about it.  Bethesda disregards the lore on multiple occasions. The first offender is T-60 suddenly appearing as a new set of pre-war power armour when it was clear that T-51 was the latest set before the bombs fell. Second is pre-war terminal entries about Jet, when its invention is part of a large subplot in Fallout 2. Next is the fact that a ghoulified child survived in a fridge without food and water for 210 years, when ghouls would previously die without water in Fallout 1. One more breach of the lore is the fact that there is a full set of Nuka Cola Quantum-themed X-01 (The Enclave's Advanced Power Armour) sealed in a pre-war case in Nuka World, when the Enclave's armour was first made in 2215.  A lot of people hate the Creation Club system with a burning passion, but it's not very malicious in practice. It's just an overpriced microtransaction system with crappy items. Just look at the Doomguy armour. That's the worst offender.  Overall, Fallout 4 isn't just a bad Fallout game, it's also a bad game.… Expand "

So I started from scratch this time and... ... initially it was really hard and boring, I couldn't find the original feel I knew from Fallout 3 and Fallout :New Vegas. I didn't like the quests which were of standard Bethesda ""go fetch"" and ""go kill"" type.  But then miracle happened: the main quest started to unfold and it turned out to be actually not bad at all. I must admit that final twist confused my feelings a lot (in a good way). Also, once I leveled up enough not to be killed in seconds it brought back curiosity and I started wandering around without fear :)  So, let's start with cons: - lot's of standard, regular quests (it is not Witcher 3 unfortunately) - weird frame rate even on strong card, game feel sluggish - there is some weird problem with shooting things in FPS mode (no VATS), you should hit someone but because he moves fast you miss. Probably related to game being sluggish. -game quite linear despite having multiple endings  Pros: - crafting system is step in the right direction, finally I had some use to all those cans and garbage. I enjoyed it - building mode was not bad, I especially enjoyed recycling my surroundings - weapon modding is actually useful - simplified perk system works good - game locations look nice, I also liked changing weather and day/night cycle - once you level up enough game feels like Fallout :)… Expand "

I won't need to go on about this because there are THOUSANDS of reviews that spell it out but to sum it up in my own words I would say a failed vision. Instead of getting better or more interesting Fallout 4 feels like a downgrade that makes a failed attempt to bring back the old. The textures I'm afraid are a huge factor for me, they are terrible on the eyes even with new texture packs offered. The graphics along with laughable dialogue and tediously boring missions don't help tie together a sequel that had high expectations.

Even after utilizing mods to make the dialogue choices mimic Fallout 3, the whole experience seemed impersonal and boring.  Settlement building seems out-of-place and distracts from the urgency of an ultimately underwhelming main story. Overall, Fallout 4 chooses to go in a different direction instead of capitalizing on its predecessors' strengths, and what we're left with is just not as strong. That being said, it's a fun game with a lot of memorable moments, and the addicting gameplay of looting, pickpocketing, hacking, and being incredibly empowered in an intriguing wasteland is here.

I genuinely enjoyed the added dimension of base-building that the game offered in settlements. Weapon and armor customization also injected a high degree of character customization into a franchise already renowned for it. Improvements to their follower NPC system are also welcome upgrades. The open world of Fallout 4's Boston is carefully crafted and exciting to explore.  But the game has a hell of a lot to answer for as well. The complete gutting of the skill system, the unwanted simplification of the face editor through the removal of sliders, and the absolutely abhorrent Creation Club being chief among them. Bethesda's utterly cynical exploitation of the modding community has divided and cheapened it, and will poison the well for generations to come. Todd Howard's idiotic obsession with streamlining the games are, at this point, reducing them to point-and-click mobile games in term of simplicity, making them ever wider but more shallow. While these deficiencies are not enough to significantly detract from Fallout 4's quality as an open-world RPG in themselves they will have long-term negative effects for the franchise and for Bethesda, casting a lengthening shadow over subsequent releases in all their franchises.

This game isnt fallout. The social aspects dont matter at all, the companions are fluff and garbage, for the most part, the enemies look great, shoot great but are craptastic ~ too easy or too hard, cant make up its mind.  Music is ripped from older games, sound effects belong in call of duty. Visuals are nice, but now its no longer an RPG with half a$$ed action elements, its action with half a$$ed RPG elements. The game doesnt let you play it and when you get hyped for any.. ANY part of it, you get shat on. The settlement building is useless, they wont defend themselves, and whether you actively try to 'break' the game by overgrowing cash crops... crisscrossing the wasteland with your unkillable transports to act as random infantry backups.. or just want extra places to store your gear, it makes it insanely easy. At least on the upper half of the map. You FINALLY get some decent difficulty once you get downtown, but by then you've spent SO much time up north and doing sidequests that it honestly makes the story pretty stupid. You jumped out of your cryochamber in the future to find your son but you got sidetracked for days.. WEEKS at a time doing go-fer fetch-me-everything-AND-KILL-THOSE-GUYS quests for people not worth your time.

The game scraps a lot of features that defined fallout being the more notable the fact that our protagonist speaks and he has already a background. Courier 6 has a background but it's one you discover while playing and it's enough that you get and idea of his past but no who he is, bc in NV you are the courier and you decide who is the courier, that can't be said about NATE/NORA bc whe alredady now they are a Housband/Wife from before the bombs fall who lived almost all theyre lives without nedding to survive or make hard decisions, that already tons down the role possibilities but when in top of that, the dialogue is a joke, we don't now what the protagonist is gonna say bc we only have 4 options that are always: Sarcastic, Agrresive, Question, Affable. To add to the problem of this game the story is really meh, in the new factions we have the Minutemen or well A Minutemen Preston you can at least decide if you want to help him regroup the minute men. The railway has more importance in this game wich is really cool and we finally see the institue : D.

There is a difference in paying $10 for a game, and it's amusing for a few hours and just okay. But let's get serious. I paid $120 for a Pip-Boy Edition and $40 for a hardbound Survival Guide. And when I went into Best Buy on Tuesday, the first thing they did was offer a $30 Season Pass for future, unreleased game content.  The problem with Fallout 4 is that I just shelled out $200 and didn't get $200 worth of satisfaction. I paid around about that on Skyrim, and Skyrim was worth every penny. I certainly didn't spend time the weekend afterwards trying to explain online why I didn't find the game... fun.  And no, I've never posted another review before. I came over here to look after a tweet from AngryJoe.  So I'd give it a 6-10. I am sorely tempted to hit 0. Why? Buying a AAA game is like an arranged marriage. You shell out the money based on the reputation of the game studio and there isn't any quickie divorce if your spouse turns out to be a broke, alcoholic mess.  People should go ahead and play the game, but get it used if you haven't already done so. Save your money for a later version where the major bugs have been fixed. And stop telling outraged gamers who feel like they've been conned and robbed that they are trolls.  Problems:  1. The plot is horrible. It's Ally McBeal. And it's not an RPG. Beyond that, it's a boring, cardboard and morally devoid non-RPG story. The game fails to make you at all interested in your primary motivation. Besides, the opening sequence was poorly disguised emotional manipulation (though pretty graphics) of kneejerk ""Support the Troops!"" It wasn't what we were expecting, which was something Epic. Instead, we got a homesick sob-story from some random guy we don't care about.  2. The voiced main protagonist is as bad as we all feared it would be (unless you are a paid reviewer). I don't mind voiced protagonists per se (Fable, Dead Space, Tomb Raider), but it breaks the particular sort of immersion that an open-world RPG can offer. You end up feeling like you are just giving a makeover to someone else no matter how many rerolls you do. The Wheel system doesn't work, largely because the options don't accurately describe the voiced dialogue. It's a rip-off of the Emotion-Wheel that failed so memorably in Fable 3.  3. The facial animations are a huge slide backwards. They might be slightly more realistic at the skin level than Skyrim, but the coordination between voice and mouth is consistently off, and the NPCs constantly make physical motions (bobbing heads, etc) at points where it's very unnatural. Worse, they fail at demonstrating an emotional context to the situation or dialogue of the NPC. Every one looks like they are standing in a long check out line at a grocery store, not like they live in a nuclear wasteland. (New players note: You can turn off the dialogue camera, which I recommend.)  4. So many Fallout favorite gameplay mechanics have been stripped out of the game: Karma, Reputation, Repair. That your gear will degrade, that replacements are rare, that upgrades are exceedingly rare, are necessary components of a survival-nuclear wasteland. The gear-candy situation and the instant trust of sheep-like people never make you feel like you are carving out a place for yourself. Instead it's more like being a rich person shopping at a thrift store because its chic.  5. The zany fun in some of the first few levels were stripped out in favor of making the opening 5 hours of game play a condensed version of a Fallout game. I literally had a sniper-rifle the equivalent of what I used to fight the Second Battle of Hoover Dam after 3 hours. In the rush to throw Power Armor, a minigun, and a Death Claw at critics before they wrote a first day review, the vast majority of players lost out on a few hours of wearing your Vault Suit in combat and killing things with pool cues and baseball bats.  6. The quests are devoid of real, convincing moral conflict or choices. Everyone hates everyone because... Because! The specifics of a lot of it would require using spoilers, so basically choosing a faction in this game is just choosing one list of different quests for each play through. In Fallout:New Vegas, you spent most of your gameplay (for example if you went NCR), negotiating out how other nonaligned factions responded in the inevitable war over Hoover Dam, thus deciding their fate in the future of the Mojave desert. There's no real moral choice here, just a whole bunch of fetch-or-kill quests for no real end purpose.  TLDR: Bugs don't make me mad at spending $200 and feel like giving this a 0. A boring, cardboard open world game stripped of any real RPG elements makes me mad that I spent more than $30. YMMV.… Expand "

The forced, repelling main story line, the fact that they dropped the Notes tab and now we use the Misc tab like a junk drawer. 'Rolling' a character is pointless if you can upgrade their base stats every consecutive level. The settlements (as neat as the idea) don't really fit in the game. How they totally **** on the lore.

Besides that the cliche story and forced characterization is extremely sub-par for a AAA $60 title, and completely removes any desire for a second play through. The overall atmosphere of the game falls flat, compared to the rest of the fallout series. The main character is a cookie cutter 1950's family man/woman with a spouse and kid,and the player is given no real choice in how their story progresses. The only divergence in the path is through charisma based dialog options, and even those choices are completely negligible, only truly mattering to your current companion. Speaking of companions, the 'vast array' available in Fallout 4 are all extremely poorly coded, have lazily written dialog, have no affect on the plot/ending, and over all become more of a nuisance than an actual wasteland companion. All of them are like having the 'Adoring Fan' from Oblivion follow you around (nearly identical AI behaviors aside), but they block doorways more often. The graphics are decent at best,and the game speed being dependent on frame rate is a pathetic disease that should not plaque games with multi-million dollar budgets. The game's engine, Creation Engine, was old in 2011, and it shows in game play. Overall as a Fallout game its a 3/10 because it is possible to enjoy this game, and its not the worst game I have ever played. That being said, I have played the Fallout series since Fallout 2, and this is by far the least enjoyable, shallowest, and overall weakest game in the entire series. However, even taking the game out of Fallout context, and considering it its very own game belonging to no series, it is still a 3/10. The extremely heavy FPS focus turns away a lot of players, who aren't big FPS gamers. The 'infinite' quests are more redundant than for(;;), and about as interesting. The settlements feels like a game all on its own, was poorly implemented, and has nothing at all to do with anything else in the game. you get no ending relating to your settlement, no bonus karma, no army, nothing. At most you get some extra caps and junk materials. The AI is absolutely horrendous, beyond outdated, and if it weren't for the lone wanderer perk, it would bring the game down to a 2/10, but the developers obviously knew that they implemented a horrible AI system, so they gave you a perk so you didn't have to deal with followers. At least that is what I've decided to believe. And finally, getting back to the Fallout series, the end of the game is so immensely disappointing that I plan to never pick the game up again. The end of the game is defined by only 1 factor, with only 4 available endings, dependent solely on which faction you side with, a pathetically low number when you consider that there were: 6 main endings and 2-4 distinct endings for each faction and companion in NV 26 different factors in 3 and in Fallout 2 there are 50+ ending scenes, all effected by your choices in the game.  TL;DR This game is shallow, poorly written, poorly coded, all the 'extra cool features' felt last minute and are all buggy or poorly implemented. The game leaves you disappointed and unfulfilled, yet gives you no incentive to start a new play through. 3/10 not worth the hype, 150 hours, or $60 dollars I wasted on it.… Expand "

The simplified dialolgue wheel and the absence of any special related dialogue options beyond Charisma is a major disappointment, and completely unnessesary. Just... why?

Why limit character design for only the smallest addition of story telling? What happened to the skills? why is every character the exact same starting off? I remember having a Stupid brute at the start of one playthrough of NV, and a smartass scientist in another... The settlement system is underdeveloped and a waste of time. It literally has zero effect on the game.  The factions are stale and their quest are all the same repeatable quests taking you to the same area... Not to mention they all lead to the same copy pasta ending scene. If Fallout 4 wasn't a Fallout game, i'd like it more. Just knowing what this could have been, leaves a sour taste in my mouth.  After all of this, i still think it's a decent game. The world is beautifully crafted, and my only gripe is that it lacks depth. Almost every location is ""Kill everything that moves and loot the simi relevent gear"". Along with the ""Kill everything"" scheme, the gunplay has been well done. It really does feel less clunky. However, if i had to choose between gunplay, and RPG elements i'd choose the RPG side.  To sum it up, If you like open world action shooters, this is a good game for you.

I see Fallout as a way different brainchild from Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas. I've been playing the Fallout series starting back in 98' on my old Dell Pentium I (one) during the RPG isometric days. I was intially happy to hear about Fallout's reboot around 2007, but was a bit disappointed in a way to find out it would be done with Bethesda's dated Gamebyro engine, which I was not impressed by ESIV: Oblivion (but you when got to save cash where it matters I suppose it isn't all that bad from a devolper's point of view) nonetheless I was still excited to hear that it would get its reboot, regardless of how it would be released. I'll give Bethesda credit for being able to create interesting worldspaces and level designs, very great at setting up atmospheres and all that it entices. But what I won't forgive them for is the lack of intelligence or effort that they decide to put into their writing for this type of role playing game. The thing that made the early Fallout titles memorable and replayable, was its really interesting story and story arcs although contained within a limited worldspace, it was able to conjure up the idea or illusion of a civilization in shambles. It was able to sustain an interesting type of universe that warded its lore with believable tragedies and at times humorous writing; all without holding the players hand through a well thought out system of dialog choices ranging from good, bad, everything in between and outright goof that would affect or tie-into the endgame story and it's arcs. It would keep you invested enough to get into its sometimes tough RPG Special system and turn based combat. It was something you learned to live with because that was what they could pull off due to technical limitations which was strongly influenced from table top games that relied heavily on the players imagination. A sort of freedom or spark that is lacking from both Fallout 3 and Fallout 4. It's something that Bethesda has failed to recapture with its own iteration's of this IP. So Fallout 4 is a whole different beast in terms of what its pretending to do. It pretends to give you choice through this awfully adopted Mass Effect dialog wheel where none of the choices you choose have any affect in the outcome of the game itself. I would not have mind the voice protagonist had it not lend itself to a linear style. Although I found it's linear narrative annoying, it's a nice post apocalyptic worldspace to look at and it comes with FPS mechanics and graphics you'd come to expect with any modern shooter.

Which are packed full of absolute lies. Either posted by fanboys in denial, or by Bethesda's employees.  This game has been nothing but disappointing so far. I've played for over 40 hours, expecting things to get better, but they have only gotten worse, casual FPS style.  The Pros:  -Graphics are improved over previous entries, but are still sub-standard.  -Enemy AI is slightly improved, animals will burrow into the ground when you try the old 'stand on a rock to get out of reach' trick that has worked in every other Bethesda RPG. Human enemies actually take cover and don't just rush to their deaths, they also weave when you are aiming at them.  -Building is a nice touch, although the mechanics of it could be hugely improved, as it is riddled with illogical flaws (like floating buildings). You can actually build a flying wooden house in the sky (not actually flying, just daft physics). Yes, really.  -The shooting mechanics are a little better than previous entries, BUT the improvement is not massive, and it still feels largely the same as F3/NV. Don't expect Bioshock shooting or anything.  -Crafting/upgrades. Good, but require far too much time investment to get anything worthwhile.  -------------  The cons:  - Dialogue. The new dialogue system is absolutely atrocious. Now F3 and NV weren't exactly perfect in terms of dialogue, but they provided interesting, unexpected choices, with numerous outcomes in every situation. Remember spitting on Butch's sweet roll? Remember being an evil character? None of this exists in F4, and this is the game's biggest failure: dialogue is now reduced to 4 choices at all times: 1) yes (the only way to progress) 2) no (=come back later if you change your mind) 3) why/what? (provides a recap of whatever has just been said, in case you skipped past the dialogue) 4) Sarcastic (tell a joke, none of which are ever funny or remotely amusing, and none have any additional effect on the conversation).  Almost every conversation has only one outcome: violence. I've obsessively re-loaded and tried multiple ways around each conversation/standoff. Only rarely was there any choice whatsoever to avert a bloodbath. More than 90% of these situations have only one outcome. I enjoyed F3 and NV even more. F4 has completely destroyed the most fun and enjoyable aspect of the series: RP and interaction with NPCs. This has truly ruined the core of the game: your choices DO NOT matter. At all.  -RPG elements removed. Seriously.  -Voiced protagonist. This was a horrible addition. I have not yet played a female character, but the male voice actor is ridiculous. He sounds completely nonchalant about everything. To clarify: his infant son has just been kidnapped, and he never gives any hints of being upset or traumatised, or being angry or anything. There are a few main story quests where he starts to sound a little upset, and of course, every storyline situation turns into a battle. You get a choice of 4 ways of saying 'ok, let's fight' every time before it starts. The voiced protagonist has no character, and really brings the whole RP element down as he plays the uncaring, nonchalant father looking (or not bothering to, most of the time) for his missing child.  -Ridiculous plot holes and narrative flaws: 1) Kellogg (the man who kidnapped your son) somehow knows your son's name, despite there being no possible way of him knowing this, having abducted the baby as an infant and having never seen or heard his name. Somehow, Kellogg magically knows Shaun's name. Ludicrous. Bethesda cannot write coherently at all.  2) I wandered into a place called Covenant, where my character immediately started getting dialogue options to ask about characters he has never heard of previously, calling them by name. This happens a LOT in Fallout 4 if you do your own exploring instead of just doing what quest-givers tell you.  -General lack of challenge, juxtaposed against cheap overpowered bullet-sponge 'legendary' enemies. The vast majority of side quests consist of 'clear all ghouls' followed by the same quest 10 times in different locations. When it's not 'kill ghouls', it's 'kill all raiders', or 'retrieve item'. These quests make up the vast majority of the game's content, and they offer no dialogue at all, just combat with no other option.  Within the first 15 minutes or so of starting the game, you are given power-armour with a minigun, and you are made to fight a Deathclaw immediately after getting this gear. Within 30 mins of that, you'll join the Brotherhood of Steel after killing a few ghouls. The power armour removes any aspect of difficulty from this game, so I absolutely refuse to use it at all, it is like having god-mode cheats activated from the beginning. I can't stand using it.  -Bugs, ranging from the mildly omical, to the game-breaking.  Do you like Fallout? Avoid this garbage!… Expand "

But later i realized that i just wasted my 5 month time on endless repetitive crappy nonsense. Some awful game experience also started to sick me. i played TESV again and found out that Skyrim is a goddamn masterpiece. Bethesda only take half or less efforts on Fallout 4 than they did in Skyrim!  I think Preston Garvey and his minutemen are totally garbage. They don't have any meaningful tasks for you, just bossing you around and making you play nice. I feel like a slave when forced to do their endless crap. I HATE PRESTON GARVEY. He is TOO good to be true, he seems fake to me. The guy has NO sense of humor, you can't even have a joke on him. Even worse, he asks player to be as Mr. Goody as he. You are the general? Sure. When people bump into him, he always says: YEAH, I AM THE PRESIDENT **** GARVEY. He NEVER Introduces ME, THE GENERAL to anyone, even once. HEY WHERE'S THE GRATITUTE? It's ME who safe their sorry asses from those scary little bugs or being kidnapped by hungry green-skin monsters LOL!  And why the hell should i help those low life farmers? I build them houses, make them beds, give them food and water, hell i even set missile turrets all around the whole damn village, i **** did everything they asked, and what did they do? They steal my delicious deathclaw steaks, they steal my fat man and gatling laser, they steal my X-01 power armor and wouldn't get out, they sleep on the bed that is supposed shared only between Piper and me. Wait, there's more. They still think you are a dangerous figure who is looking for trouble, they still suspect you to be the synth spy sent by the evil institute, they still complain about their filthy fingernails filled with mud to ruin your dinner. And the best part is that these idiots love bossing you around. When i beat one place and about to loot legendary miniguns, a dude sit on the ground next to the treasure chest and yell at me: Hey you, i was kidnapped by these scary little bugs, take me to my house 100 meters from here or i won't get up and you are an **** WTF??? These kinds of kidnapping **** even happens before the task is activated. I dare say these cute bugs are the world's best bodyguards for those hostage cosplay lovers because the dude ""kidnapped"" will stay in that place forever if you just ignore them. Once i used console command to summon that idiot back to his house and guess what? He just walked back to the place where he was ""kidnapped""!  The companions are dull. Most of their stories are boring after all, losing girls, losing mommy and daddy, all the same stuff. You know, this is wasteland, i don't really care about some miserable pass, too common in this **** commonwealth. i want something new, something that can really hook my mind, some adventurous type story. This game has no totally badass followers. All humanoid companions dislikes murder. Why the hell? You gotta trust our judgement. We killed this son of **** because we have a DAMN GOOD REASON, that's why, and that's that. All companions except Hancock dislike chem use at last, even include Cait after helping her rid of drug addict and MacCready if romanced. What's wrong with chem anyway? Yeah we know drug is bad in real life but this is Fallout 4!  BUT these are not the most disgusting thing. The worst **** is, why the hell is everybody just shoot player if they get pissed by a even accidental or minor mistake? I remember once i got caught when stealing a BOBBY PIN in Diamond City, the guard just shoot on sight, and the whole city turn hostile immediately. WTF is wrong with these people? Petty crime is different from capital offence, you know. The faction setting in this game is totally ****. NPCs solve problems only by killing and violence, they never talk or negotiate first. This is goddamn barbaric! NPCs in fallout 4 never understand the difference between friendly fire/collateral damage and intentional murder, the whole bunch of people just shoot you without warning first if you accidentally hit them. I remember in Skyrim friendly NPC would usually say I AM ON YOUR SIDE or DON'T DO THAT if you hit them by accident. The city guards will always try to ask for fine first before attack in TESV.  The faction setting also makes companions can easily turn against you. Most companions will become immediately hostile in many cases. Where the hell is loyalty then? Sure, they have your whatever good point, but they shouldn't stab me on the back. That's treason, and I HATE TRAITORS. And i can't revenge on damn traitors because this game set companions as essential characters and they are invincible!… Expand "

In terms of gameplay Fallout 4 is a mix between Fallout and Far Cry. The main concern in the game is to shoot other people in the head. RPG element of the game has been weakened in many ways (even though it has been improved in others). The new dialog layout is stupid and unintuitive but after all the dialog does not offer much variety and regardless of what action you take it has more or less not impact on the world or the player. For example the whole Karma system is removed completely from the game and this is and this is a terrible great loss.  I can forgive bugs and other small errors in the game given that these are fixed latter. I am not picky when it comes to graphics either. But textures look very poor and for some reason they get worse after i’ve been playing making the world look uggly. However, I can not forgive the developers to create a game that does not measure up in the story and gameplay.  To me, it seems like ’new devs’ were let into the warm room to make the game more ’’accessible’’ and ’’streamlined’’ as its called… and it shows because the game suffers because of these stupid ideas and if it becomes more dumbed-down you may as well not call it fallout anymore.. but Fallcry.

IamJacksReason,"Nov 19, 2015",6," Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Bethesda games starting from Morrowind in 2002. Over the years I've probably spent thouthands of hours playing their Fallout and Elder Scrolls games and enjoyed them very much. I am also a Fallout series fan, although I cant boast that I played the first games in the series, unfourtunately. I think, whether it is good or bad for bothLet me start by saying that I am a huge fan of Bethesda games starting from Morrowind in 2002. Over the years I've probably spent thouthands of hours playing their Fallout and Elder Scrolls games and enjoyed them very much. I am also a Fallout series fan, although I cant boast that I played the first games in the series, unfourtunately. I think, whether it is good or bad for both franchises (TES and Fallout), they are increasingly being brought down the same path by the devs. I am not happy with the direction they chose. And Fallout 4, sadly, is just another step in this process of simplification, just like Skyrim before it. Yes, it is true that Fallout 4 has some new features of different degree of coolness - like crafting system (which imho is the best mechanics this game has to offer), or settlement management (which is also somewhat nice). I strongly believe that open world RPG games should have as much opportunities and game mechanics as possible for the players to choose, yet, preferably, they should not be obligatory. With Fallout 4 Bethesda managed to deliver in this department. My main grudge with this game is that it just oozes laziness. It's like Bethesda decided to do the game somewhere in the beggining of 2015, quickly assembled all the existing parts of previous games together, implementing a couple of new features and released it . My sincere hope is that it was due to them devoting the majoity of their time and resources to the next Elder Scrolls game) You can see the lazy approach almost everywhere. I'm not talking about the graphics here - yes, it is dated and powered by the same engine as Oblivion (or as some say even Morrowind), although heavily updated, but that is not the point. You can deliver a solid and polished-looking product even with not-so-hi-res textures or without some fancy postprocessing. But the game fails miserably to do that. The distant buildings look like they are made of carton (and badly made for that matter, like if you would assemble a carton box and fail to correctly align its sides), distant water is divided by a clearly visible ugly-looking line, etc. And DON'T YOU DARE trying too look out of the widows when you're inside! You will witness the most horribly assembled apocalypse scenery with the earth cracked open into the greyish void of nothingness and ugly carton boxes desperately trying not to fall down through them. I don't understand the devs here. Do they honestly think that people should overlook such things. It is immersion breaking. And such games should be all about immersion. Ok, let the scenery outside lack polygons or whatever, but at least make it orderly and polished, or hide it altogether. It is like trying to wear your suit inside out to a very important meeting and hoping that no one will notice that you look like a hobo. Another dissapointing thing is the omission of the skills-leveling system. RIP RPG-element. I don't understand why they keep doing this first with TES then with Fallout. Perks are ok, but why not combine it with the good old skills and characteristics?! Miserable dumb down. A couple more iterations like this and Fallout 6 and TES 7 will feature only one attribute - health, or awesomeness... Or none at all, why bother. Surprisingly, also omitted was the feature of displaying holstered weapons. In this, I guess, the devs decided to honor their 2002 masterpiece) I see no other resonable explanation for this. How could anyone decide that it was somehow better not to see your weapon hanging behind your shoulder? I saw on some forum that it was due to a multy-layered armor system. But that is an excuse fit for modders, not the AAA-game developing studio. But after what I saw in Fallout 4 windows I should probably not be surprised. They also decided not to invest much in soundtrack, as I think 70-80% of songs I heard on the radio were  the same ones I heard in Fallout 3/New Vegas. The UI... console port, enough said. It's a common knowledge that animations are Bethesda's weakness. This time, however, they are somehow even worse than in Skyrim. Go see any youtube 3rd person videos.. Another shortcoming is the omission of hardcore mod with survival elements, which was present in New Vegas.  Overall, regrettably, Fallout 4 fails to deliver a truly entertaining and immersive experience. Its replayability, which is, I think, one of the most important qualities for any video game, is significantly hampered by the lack of diverse levelling system, while overall lazy execution by bethesda does everything to kill immersion. There are strong points, of course. And for a while they will offset some of the negatives for devoted players or diehard fans. But the devs should not be encouraged to pull off such lazy releases on us, and their work does not deserve the high scores awarded to it by the media and some of the gamers. 6/10 for taking my attention for a couple of days.

Where was the Fallout feeling, where was the desire to play on?  I tried messing with the graphics (to solve the mysterious problem of the game being horribly overbright to look at), I considered a new character, starting over and taking it more slowly. I yanked the difficulty to Survival so I would feel that I was in danger at least. Everything. In the end I tried to push on, to go out and just explore, to feel the world itself. Then after a few hours more it struck me. the plain, horrible truth of it: Fallout 4 is a mediocre game. Plain and simple, I never thought I would say that out loud but it's the truth.  The graphics are mediocre, the scenery is nice but skin textures stretch awkwardly across poorly animated actors. The voice acting is bad, the story offers no immersion and doesn't spark any desire to explore or interact. I tried to ignore all that and set out on one of the classic exploration tours that I loved in the former Fallout games. Just going into the wasteland, feeling that specific tingling that comes with exploring a dead world where anything (often times something terrible) is waiting around the corner.  I went from house to house, explored, looted. Found dead people but they meant nothing. The town had no feeling, just random houses with a surprising abundance of loot. At that time it hit me for real, I shouldn't have bought this game. I had thrown money out the window. I was now at the mercy of the modding community, I pray they'll save this train wreck.

At the core, FalloutFallout 4 is an exceedingly difficult game for me to score.  Currently, the game sits at a 5.4/10 here with just under 6,000 ratings.  This low score does not come from the game being broken, buggy or bad per se, but from taking what could be a really fun game and then underperforming in basically every category, most offensively the fact that this a Fallout game.  At the core, Fallout is a RPG franchise.  Fallout 4 continues the trend of stripping away RPG mechanics and replacing them with more action.  Gone are the intricate SPECIAL (ability score) builds to acquire certain skills and perks to make the wasteland diplomat or wandering sniper.  Every character kind of plays the same here, exception being whether you deal double damage with a melee weapon or an automatic gun.  Skills are out, replaced with stats which do nothing notable but gate perks which do nothing notable really.  20% extra damage with this type of weapon, some extra hit points, increased stealth, not much but combat stuff (base building stuff aside, we'll get there in a bit!), as far as I know, none of your character build choices can really affect much outside of killing things.  By contrast, my typical Fallout 1 or 2 character prioritizes intelligence, charisma and speech skills to waltz his way through branching dialogue trees, unlocking all those juicy hidden speech checks, solving everyone's problems diplomatically and generally being a righteous dude.  Fallout 4 dialogues essentially ignore your SPECIAL scores or perks, unless you're asking for more (and more, and more... really?) money, then you'd better be packing charisma (or, at least reload and put on a nice suit, hat and glasses for the same effect).  Each and every dialogue boils down to saying yes 4 different ways.  Unless, of course, you're chatting up a shopkeep, in which case you can click to spend money!  Earlier Fallouts incorporated you character's SPECIAL, skills and sometimes perks into quests, from simply being able to fix a brahmin's broken leg to proving your handiness with explosives to an old cowboy.  Unfortunately, Bethesda tosses it all out the window.  Even Skyrim had some reactivity based on your character build, ""Favor the bow, eh?"" - none of that in FO4.  Story has never really been this franchise's strong suit, Fallout is more about experiencing and interacting with a finely crafted, post apocalyptic world.  That's fine, we don't always need twists, turns and huge reveals.  Fallout 4 goes for it anyway and never really delivers.  The big reveal 3/4 of the way through the main quest is so hamfisted and obvious by the time you get to it that you would have to be skipping all of the conversations to not see it coming a mile away.  And it all feels exceptionally underwhelming, especially since you can't roleplay a character and only choose whether to be the solemn sole survivor or the sarcastic one.  Fallout 4 attempts to build upon the faction system worked into Fallout: New Vegas by Obsidian.  The system in NV was quite complex as you gain and lose reputation with the various players in the Mojave.  The 'factions' in FO4 are more like the guilds in previous The Elder Scrolls games, you can work will all of them as much as you like with no consequences.  After a handful of quests, you're up to the point where you choose who helps you win the game.  And then none of these 'decisions' are factored into the ending, something FO1&2 did brilliantly over 15 years ago.  Probably the biggest addition to the franchise is the town building aspect.  Being able to choose from 20 or so locations to set up your own, personal Falloutville was a really neat touch, and what I spent most of my time on.  The feature feels blatantly unfinished, bolted on and, usually, infuriating (damn you wall, attach to my floor!), but hauling materials back to my town and using them to build walls, houses and shops and then populate them tickled some simple, ocd part of me.  Unfortunately, so much more could have been done with this feature, especially since the bulk of it had fairly steep character build requirements.  I would have loved to see more unique settlers, quests and interaction between towns.  After a while, settlement building, like the rest of the game, just gave more frustration than pleasure.  In summary, had Fallout 4 been a new IP, it would have been rated much higher.  People come into a Fallout game expecting a rich RPG experience.  We got a FPS with stripped down RPG mechanics shoehorned in, insultingly simplistic storytelling, and unreactive world and an unfinished base building minigame.  Is the game fun?  Yes.  Is it a true Fallout experience?  No.… Expand "
Shekel,"Jan  5, 2016",1, I am a very big fallout fan. With that said the overwhelming disappointment I feel while playing Fallout 4 makes me hurt even more. There is a major issue with companies misappropriating development funds and placing them into their marketing team and not the actual game. I haven't seen a game marketing department.

I'll try to split this up in groups  Positives: - Vastly improved gunplay the games really needed - The crafting and settlement system might not be for everyone but I've been really enjoying it and its something I've always wanted in a Fallout game - Atmosphere, music, and world building are all good  Neutral: - Graphics are more negative than positive but I do think some people exaggerate how bad they are, aside from the textures. I can generally look past it but they have their moments when I am severely underwhelmed. - Quests are sometimes good, sometimes absolutely trash. About what you'd expect from Bethesda I guess but haven't had anything particularly exciting yet.  Negatives: - Dialogue System/Voiced main character are both just awful. Is it really too much to know exactly what I'm going to respond with? It also severely limits your freedom of choice with your character and your responses. - Lack of player choice, which is based off of the voiced main character. Its actually impossible to be evil in this game, refuse to do quests, or pick alternatives because it would have been exponentially more expensive to do the voice overs for all the branches. - The perk system feels ultra casualized. What the hell is the point of making another character when you can just keep leveling up and using points to raise your SPECIAL stats? - Terrible writing in the main story line, way too cliche, shoehorns your character into a very specific mold regardless of how you want to play  Overall, Fallout 4 gets some stuff right but wow, it completely threw major components of what made Fallout a fun RPG game into the trash in favor of a watered down FPS-Open World game. I really hope they learn from this and do not repeat this on any TES or Fallout games in the future. If Bethesda was so hell bent on telling the story they wanted to in this game they should have done it outside of Fallout - its completely antithetical to what they have always been.  I still enjoy the game and I'm going to keep enjoying it, but make no mistake, its barely worthy of the ""Fallout"" name and its really pushing the boundaries of what I'd consider acceptable for the streamlining of a Bethesda RPG. I love the games and the lore but I'm going to approach everything else they release with a lot more caution in the future.… Expand "

If your coming here for a classic bethesda RPG (The Elder Scrolls & earlier fallout instalments) I would say don't set your bar very high.  Pro's:  Shooting mechanics vastly improved from earlier iterations (though you might expect that considering they're 6 years newer). Exploration is still fun perhaps the best of any bethesda game with a densely packed map. Weapon customisation is much more than a gimmick and lets you deeply customise your weapons. Fallout theme still feels very strong and old players will know the world straight away.  Cons:  A voiced protagonist CAN work. Mass Effect did it superbly, being a badass with Shepherd felt natural but so did being a saint. FO4 however falls way below the mark, and I feel as though anyone who has played the previous games can feel this. The dialogue is on rails, meaning what you say in convos has little or no effect on the path of the conversation, gone are the days of saying something so aggressive or offensive the whole town pulls a piece on you, it is literally totally cosmetic (around 90% of the time at least.)  The game completely prevents you from making any kind of impactful evil/heroic choices!! There are a few at the end, but it's the lack of the small choices and seeing how those choices affect the people around you that really hit home in mid game. I just felt the whole game and every time the portage opened his mouth that this was their character, not mine, a far cry from the madness of NV or FO3 or Oblivion.  The game absolutely forces this character upon you from the instant, something they have NEVER done before in ANY game. When you get shot in NV, escape the prison in oblivion, break out of the vault in FO3, all of those games gave you a very grey start that set the stage for you to have reasons for being evil, and reasons for being good. Fallout 4 FORCES you to be good, literally. I cannot overstate how unnatural it feels to  be an evil character in this game, such a stark contrast from any of the previous titles.  Finally, THERE ARE NO SKILLS. Nope, you read that right, none. No more big guns science speech bartering, all there is is the ""Special"" scheme from the last game and some perks which add SOME depth, but levelling up the individual perks really became tedious, and it puts a barrier in the way of fine tuning your character thats hard to explain.  In conclusion, this game was fun, definitely, and there is a lot of innovation here. To say this game is bad would be a lie. There were frame rate drops and some graphical issues but I don't play these games for that so didn't bother me. What a do play them for however, is immersion and character development, both of which, are inconceivably lacking, considering bethesda's past.… Expand "

Low polygon stuff, unnecessarily high resolution but still rather low quality textures. Long loading time, stutter, freeze, there seems to be issue about Nvidia vs AMD again. For all the technical problems piles up in exchange for a game that looks like from 2010... it just fail this category. The developer seriously should have just throw that old game engine to the bin already and use something more modern, at least Unreal Engine 3 or something. I understand that the game is made for modding and I guess that's the primary reason why they stuck with an engine so old. But still, should have use other better engine and spent the time to figure out about the modding addition.  2, audio and dialog Bland. Oh their son got kidnapped, husband/wife got killed... and... Still sounds like your character just woke up from a normal day sleep nothing had happened. Nothing much interesting about all those dialogs.  3, story & quests Kill the raiders / monsters, setup radio tower, repeat. Is there even a story in this game? So far after a few days playing, everything seems so bland. Hell even S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl have a decent story to it from the get go.  4, weapon, gears & combat, etc Before I going to talk about combat I have to point out the interface is terrible to sort / find items. With equipped items stays in the same list, it's annoying to move stuff around and often accidentally move or even worst - scraped your gear. Worst when you try to scroll the whole big list trying to find your junk material... Weapons have no durability and don't lock up. Wut?! Those pipes quality sure are good! Duh... I understand they trying to keep the game really ""crude"" with all those pipes weapons, but seriously isn't this is the USA we're talking about? With all those pipes weapons, the combat isn't exactly great in early game. Weapon/bullet ballistic, it just doesn't have any good feelings playing those weapons. Can be the problem of bland audio and visual feedback making everything seems kinda cartoonish. Gun fights seems pretty boring in this game. And those NPCs can takes like what... 10... 20 bullets onto their head... (there is a mod to fix this problem) And that stupid dog, always get in my way. And it can carry as much items I load onto it and it still runs normally. Doesn't seem to be any weight limit on it? And oh, it doesn't even have any bags, how can a dog carry so many stuff LOL! Terrible. The radiation mechanics in this game is weird and almost useless. I am almost wearing nothing and still can stand in the radiation storm without much trouble. Go swim in the river and got some radiation, came back on land and no more radiation that continues to kill you, instead it just a static red bar on your health bar. Radiation doesn't seem to be even a threat AT ALL.  5, settlement system I don't know if that appear in older Fallout game, but there was a game I played that have 100% identical system, Rust. In Rust, the constructing system is more robust and easy to use. But this game have some issues like not allowing you to place an item, having some weird gaps, or the super annoying snapping problem. In the end of the day there are just some critical mods required in this department to spice the settlement system up - mods that adds TONS more items to make, increase build range, allow placing despite ""red"", allow clipping, etc... I can see that this is a interesting part of the game that people will spent most of their time into than anything else.… Expand "

I am not sure if it was Todd Howards own decision or if the management level told him to design the game like this, but Fallout 4 is just a hull disemboweled from all elements the previous Fallouts made so famous.  The good side of the game are the improved graphics (still no challenge for other 2015 titles, but if you look at Fallout 4 and then start up Fallout: NV you know what i mean) and the really nice looking gameworld and the new gun handling that feels fantastic to previous fallouts and upgrading your weapons is a better version of the module upgrades from Fallout New Vegas. But thats already the point where the positive stuff ends.  Beeing able to build settlements is a nice feature but at last it´s only a time sink for to increase your ingame time as it does not affect the game world/progress with anything.  The negative parts are that Fallout 4 got rid of everything that made the old Fallouts out. The Dialogue system has no multilayered choices anymore. In previous Fallouts saying ""no"" to an npc often opened the option to be able to talk to another person and get another quest or something else. Nothing like this left, 4 options where 3 are all the same (say yes, yes ironically, yes with getting some options) or no. And no only ends the dialogue leaving you with... nothing. Quests are not multi-layered anymore and Fallout 4 is filled up with repeating radiant quests mainly. 3-4 interesting mini-multi-layeres sidequest lines, the rest is simple: go there, kill everything, get something that is done in normaly 5 minutes.  The rpg part is the most controverse i have seen yet and it´s design (and player reactions) remind me a bit of the Diablo 3 desaster. It is not your character in Fallout 4 anymore as the perk system is that way simplyfied that it forgives every wrong set point in the next few levels. And you can´t really set wrong skills as only the weapon affecting skills are really useful, the rest will nearly never change anything of your experience. Where lockpicking/hacking was a useful skill in previous fallouts to get a better armor/weapon at some point it will only give you 10 shots ammo and some bottlecaps more in Fallout 4. Exploration gets not rewarded, in absolute no point as nearly all special items are directly placed on your mainquest route.  Fallout 4 turned out to be a nice looking shooter with a Fallout shirt put on, but from it´s rpg demanding and good rated predecessors is not really much left. I really don´t like the direction Bethesda went with this franchise, they could also have called it Wolfenstein:The Fallout.  I give it a 4 points as the graphics are still okay and fitting for the theme and it gave me some hours moving through the game world. Everyone who is looking for more should take a step back and maybe choose another title.… Expand "

The new voiced protagonist is also a bummer. Even though I really enjoyed Courtenay Taylor as Jack in Mass Effect 2, I found her to be fairly bland and flat as the main protagonist.  It's clear to me that the bulk of Fallout 4's budget was funneled into the settlement building mechanics which I have to admit can be quite fun especially since I also enjoy builder type games but that's not the experience I'm looking in this franchise.

If the roleplaying aspect of the game had even a tiny amount of depth, I'd probably feel a lot better about it but Fallout 4 is so shallow as far as the roleplaying aspect goes, it's just damn sad.

If you are a newcomer to this franchise (especially from Skyrim), chances are high for you to enjoy it.  What has been improved:  1) Gunplay and general movement(not to be confused with controls). Those elements were atrocious in previous 2 games. If you don't own the game already and you're hearing people saying that gunplay is not good, those people never played Fallout before. Bethesda really improved gunplay mechanics, they are smooth, responsive and the won't be disturbing you. Yes, it is no Destiny but it will do the trick quite well.  2) Interactive world. You can now build your own settlements, you can populate them with settlers and you can find new parts to build int the world. Yes, there is lack of parts and there is also a limit on how many settlers you can have in settlement, but that will be changed by mods. Truth is, that Bethesda should have done that already (considering 5 year production) but for some reason decided not to. Junk now also matters, because it can be broken down to raw materials, which you need for building and modding your weapons.  3) Weapon and armor modding. You can now modify you armor and guns. You can change barrels, stocks, add scopes and bayonets. You heavily modify your armors to add more funncions and protection against various hazards. You have power armor at your disposal in which you can and should use, to get pass by some harder encouters in the game.  4) Music. The score is very good, on par with previous Fallouts.  What has been changed (fu**** up):  1) Dialogues. You can't see what is your character going to say. Instead of whole sentences like in skyrim or F3/F:NV you are now stuck with 4 (~ 3 words each) and you have No idea what's your character going to say. I've found myslef in situations, where I had to reaload because my character said something I had no intention in saying. The voice over is not great by any means either. The character sounds silly, like Mark Wahlberg from The Happening. Lot of those voice overs sound like work of an intern sitting on the toilet.  2) Controls. I don't think Bethesda has any idea what a computer is. The button layout is absolutley infuriating and you will be finding yourself yelling on the poor monitor because key mapping is counter-intuitive. The whole interface is a mess. You can see it was developed for controller. Pip-boy (your handheld inventory manager) is hell to navigate trough using keyboard/mouse. You have also no slider for FoV and some of the gun will occupy half of your screen (no matter the resolution).  3) Skills and perks. So Bethesda got rid of skills (yeah, you read that right, they are gone). Instead you have 7 base attributes and some perks to choose from. The perks available depend on level of your key attributes. When you level up, you have a point to spare. That's it. that is the entire extend of rpg elements this game has to offer No longer you can build your character with skills and specialize him with perks. No. You will be stuck with this. If you are new comer, you might like it. If you came here from previous fallouts, you will probably cry.  4) Story and quests. So reviewier who writes that the story was great is either payed, retarded or never played Fallout before. The story is below mediocre at best and it is pulled down further by dialogues and poor voice-over. Now the best story you can have is the one you make yourself. That is true, but some kind of narrative is required because this is not fu**** Minecraft. Even today I can remember most of the characters from F3 and F:NV. Hell, the DLC's in New Vegas? They had absolutley great narrative, their characters were interesting (okay, Honest Hearts was mediocre). Do not expect anything like that in Fallout 4.  5) Difficulty. Fallout 4 offers 6 difficulties. The last one beeing survival and let me tell you. it sh*ts on everything New Vegas improved. You no longer need to sleep, eat or drink. Stimpacks heal you overtime (which takes ton of time) while sleeping in any bed will miraculously heal you (I've managed to sleep and heal injuries while enemies who injured me were in the next room). Enemies became bullet-sponges and do insane damage while ammo is so scarce to find. At that point, the game is no longer enjoyable and becomes annoying to play.  Overall, if you played previous games, these changes are killers. Some can be mitigated by mods, but those will take time to develop and test. For a game that has been in development for 5 years, this is poor result.… Expand "

I've been playing the games since the original, and each one I've felt was better than the last. Even when Bethesda came in and overhauled the core gameplay with Fallout 3 I welcomed the change. When Obsidian returned for New Vegas I felt the game was as good as it could get. Updated engine, and intriguing characters/world? Yes, please.  The gameplay for Fallout 4 is pretty similar to FO3 with some improvements to combat, and the hotkey system being the most obvious. The biggest addition to the game would be the settlement crafting, which, IIRC, was a very popular mod for NV/FO3. However you're extremely limited on what can be created and placed. Settlements are, currently, where the modding community thrives.  The SPECIAL/perk system has been re-imagined as this over-loaded chart that has you increase the rank of a perk for more benefits. There is no level cap and as such allows your character build to be inconsequential in the end. Gone are the options to make your character intelligent with special dialogue options to outsmart an Institute scientist, or being so stupid that you'd believe radroaches started the Great War.  However, for me, the gameplay in Fallout was always backseat to the story, lore, characters, and world. Fallout 4 however completely seems to miss the mark on this. The Commonwealth seems to be filled with bland, two-dimensional characters. Talking with these NPC's is relegated to ""four"" choices of spoken dialogue, but with a mod that displays the full dialogue option, rather than just a single keyword, it's clear that all the ""choices"" are more or less the same. The game is pretty much ""on rails"".  Quests are seriously lacking, and other than main-story quests are, more or less, repeated fetch/kill quests. The other main quest type is the ""protect"" or ""scout"" settlement quests. Over, and over ad infinitum. The over-all writing seems to suffer. I find myself completely disinterested in the plight of the main character, the factions in the area, and the Commonwealth as a whole. There are a few exceptions to this. Some of the companions personal quests are intriguing, and The Covenant settlement is interesting.  Overall I find myself TRYING to enjoy the game rather than actually enjoying it. I put off doing any quests in favor of modding, and crafting settlements. I find myself mindlessly exploring the wastes simply ""because"" rather than having the urge to continue on, and find out what happens next.  The best thing that can come from Fallout 4, again in my opinion, is that Obsidian now has access to new assets to make a better game. One that Fallout 4 should have been.… Expand "

There is no consequences whatsoever to anything you do (crazy example: insulting a BoS elder and mocking their values, won't prevent them from making you a paladin two minutes later), there is no real dialogue (all choices have exactly same outcome, you can't even deny doing quests for NPCs, if you say you don't want - they just ask to think again, and you go back to the same dialogue fork, with only way out to accept the quest), there almost zero interesting bald characters (I could count two or three maybe), all the side quests and huge chunk of main plotline are boring fetch and kill quests (which game happily generate procedurally for you, as all you want to do in Fallout game is do boring kill-all-raiders-and-get-an-item quests). Note: if you familiar with other games in series, you no doubt aware, that side quests, where you meet interesting character and discover things about the world, were the actual ""meat"" of the games, where main quest line was just a skeleton it was handing on. Non of it is here, after doing couple of dozen of side quests, I just stopped bothering, because literally not of them were interesting, it was just a boring side activity, without as much as an interesting story to discover in old terminal. Grind, as they call it. Every faction in game was just a bunch of boring illogical one-dimensional cliche stereotypes, leaving me with non to emotionally or rationally relate. And you didn't even had an option to side non of them, you had to join one of them, and kill all the others (BTW: peaceful solution was not an option in absolute majority of main and quests). Out of love for the series, I decided to finish the game (main quest) but I must tell, it wasn't a rewarding experience. At the end, I just ignored all the sides quests, dragged myself throughout the rest of the game, reluctantly joined one faction (which looked only a tiny bit less stupid than the rest) to finish the main quest. And I got rewarded by most boring and anticlimatic ending one can imagine. And they added insult to an injury, as apparently no matter which faction you end with - you get the same cinematic (albeit few phrases changed).And you just continue playing (read: killing raiders and fetching items) as nothing had happened. Nothing you did - really  mattered.  So if you looking for a Fallout game - skip this or you will be greatly disappointed. If you just want to shoot some raiders in a Fallout-themed world - you might give it a try.

Swannicus,"Nov 22, 2015",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I enjoy the graphics upgrade and brighter world.  Would be nice if they put in some greenery at some point, it is 200 years after the war. The gunplay enhancements are also nice but still lagging behind anything considered current in FPSes.  Being unable to target limbs in VATS as a melee character and the ridiculous imbalances of combat in general are sad. (Enemies are bullet sponges, you can get the best weapons minutes into the game) The atmosphere is gutted, the voice acting is frequently out of place and tells you how to play your character (4 variants of the same thing).  The world would actually be fine, if rather small and shallow, if the game was set 30-60 years after the war but 200 makes it ridiculous.  A city of 50 people is not a city, its a collection of shacks.  There should be many, many more humans and much larger civilizations without intervening elements stopping them.  Feral ghouls are silly zombies, legendary enemies are immersion breaking in their gameyness, super mutants are barely explained and just orcs.  What really irks me is that decent writing and atmosphere shine through occasionally but there is just so much mediocrity between each nugget. Animations are again a step up but still lagging behind any other relevant games.  Bethesda really needs to invest in some good coders and animators to either fix their broken engine or buy/make a new one.  Also still no ladders and 5 minute loading screens on a decent rig?  Could be handled better. The factions appear interesting at first glance but they are again shallow and out of place.  Spoiler warnings but minute men are a bunch of squatters who claim to be rebuilding and protecting the wasteland but actually just rely on you for everything from planting crops to killing 6 ghouls.  The railroad is tiny and has no other goals than saving synths, they should be a minor faction.  Brotherhood of Steel are actually better represented than they were in F3 but their ending is a copy and paste from F3 as well (hope you liked Liberty Prime).  The Institute is approaching decency but they again feel shallow and out of place.  Their goals are all over the board, which could be seen as a fault of them just being scientists and not leaders but its not written well enough to do so.  So many things are just poorly handled from synth replacers to stopping cyborg augmentation. If you want an RPG with decent gunplay, an immersive story about a technologically superior force interfering with the denizens of wasteland america, warring against the somewhat ineffective peace bringing civilization and the brutal but effective questionable group on the otherside with half a dozen minor factions spread out, play Fallout New Vegas.

Modifying weapons is very entertaining. -Power armor rocks, especially compared to older games. Brotherhood of Steel intro is amazing. -Calling in a vertibird is sweet.  Cons: -There's a LOT less customization when you level up. This is, hands down, my biggest complaint. Before you got to spend points on skills and you got a perk every other level. Now, you start the game with FAR less S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats and have to invest perk points into them. A large number of the good skills relies on having high SPECIAL attributes, but since you start with VERY low SPECIAL, you end up spending a massive number of levels dumping them into stat points. In Fallout 3 / 4, a lot of the sweet perks didn't have SPECIAL requirements, or they were very low. In this game, a ton of them require 9-10 points, and it's VERY hard to get that many. This ties into the next problem. -You level up much, much slower, even with a ton of points in intellect. I can NOT stress this enough. I regularly get 13 exp points for picking MASTER locks, compared with 50/60 from the last games. You regularly need to do 4-5 quests for a single level later in the game. When you combine this with the fact that you have to dump so many of your points into SPECIAL, it feels like a massive waste.  -Remember the passive benefits you got from skill points in the previous games? Like being able to pick tougher locks, doing more damage with guns, and sneaking? Well, that's exclusively tied to perks now.  -Repeatable quests ad nauseum. Some of the main quest lines (looking at you, minutemen) REQUIRE repeatable quests. This isn't an MMO, we don't need to log-in for our daily grind.  -So we have repeatable quests, you level far slower, and when you level up you often have to dump your points into SPECIAL points, and the developers saw fit to not only massively reduce your starting SPECIAL, but also increase the SPECIAL you need for perks. In combination, this makes the game very, very tedious.  -Some weapons scale horribly into the late game. In previous games, you could use a 10mm for the entire game if that's what you wanted to do. Now, it sucks pretty bad after the start because the mods are all low level. In comparison, a ton of the plasma weapons are flat out better than everything else.  -Building a settlement can be a MASSIVE PAIN IN THE ASS. First, you have to pickup junk everywhere which fills your inventory. Now, you can deposit that junk at any settlement. Oops, that only gives those the materials at THAT settlement, when there are 20ish in the game. See where I'm going here? Playing ""fast travel to transport junk 100x to my new settlement"" isn't fun. This is somewhat fixed, although not entirely, with supply caravans. Unfortunately, you need 6 charisma and a point in a perk just to make the settlement building not completely infuriating. Why not just make caravans a given and give them shared inventory? Sure, it's not completely realistic, but it's such a huge pain in the ass gameplay wise to haul junk around between 20 different settlements.  -Some of the NPCs are incredibly boring and stupid. Preston is so boring that I almost fall asleep when he starts talking. Paladin Danse is a massive walking stereotype. It's ironic, because the first thing I thought about him was, ""Is this guy a robot?"". Little did I know how true that would turn out to be. Piper is a goody-goody two shoes that would NOT survive in the wasteland, although she's more interesting than a lot of the rest of the cast. Dog shows up out of nowhere, somehow knows how to do elaborate tricks, and decides to worship you for no apparent reason. The Railroad is retarded.  Honestly, for me the saving grace of this game was the Brotherhood of Steel and power armor. BoS is extremely awesome in this game and actually has a valid goal, however ruthless it may be.… Expand "

Dogmeat is fun, but then, maybe just for me.. he was making too much constant noise that it took away from the immersion of this desolate wasteland.. it was so much whimpering.. smh..  the base/shelter building is basic. i was expecting more. The graphics.. geeze.. it's basically 2016.... in my opinion.. shadow of mordor, alien isolation, Wolfenstein, MGSV, Mad Max,The W3.. even a heavily modded Skyrim looks better, imo.. i run in ultra, @60 on a 1440 27 inch.. They're okay.  And, the dialogue.. smh.. it's not great.. imo, it's generic, dull and predictable.  The power armor makes me not care how my armor/clothes look.. power armor is crucial, imo.. so why care about what cool armor you might loot throughout the game..?  imo, that's sad. i really liked that about the w3.. it was after 150 hrs. it was still rewarding to find the full set of viper gear.. and, it looked cool.  in skyrim, you could marry, have a family, buy a house.. in this you had a family.. you build a shelter basically for other settlers.. but, you don't feel like you're your own character bc you already have a lost spouse, and a child somewhere out there..  one example of where you can tell the game isn't polished that you really can't disagree with me with, even if you don't agree with any of what i said before.. is the slow mo bullet action via VATS.. it's inconsistent, glitchy, and rarely looks smooth.. it's plain wonky. even why you try to chat.. i was told to go talk to Preston.. i go and click on chat.. he's like ""what do you need?"" then he proceeds to walk away to the other side of this house in the middle of nowhere and starts pumping water and i have to basically chase him to keep the conversation going... Lol.. huh??  2 years ago if this game came out, i'd say it's a pretty good game, but the graphics on the character models are still out of date..  The good... is that the modding community is going to work on this.  but, in my mind.. this is not worth $60.. more like a 39.99 dollar game.. it's not epic. i think my expectations were too high.. and, these games that have basically all come out before have far superior writing/gfx.. again, imo.  it's still a fun game. and, i'm downloading from nexus and experimenting with stuff and have put around 30 hrs. into it, and will put a lot more..  it's just funny bc you will see this reviews and i'm like.. does everyone just want to get on Bethesda's good side??  bc, they gave them a pre-release review copy..?  A lot of them are saying the same stuff that i basically said, but they're giving this game a 9/10, or a 9.5/10..… Expand "

Where did it all go wrong, somewhere along the road it seems the company lost track of what sort of game they were developing. Bethesda seem to have convinced themselves that the action-adventure RPG they won countless awards for needed less of what made it such a great game. Instead of building on the previous titles and giving people more of what they loved they decided to pursue other paths. Some of these innovations added to the game, some detracted and some simply proved to be hollow gimmicks with little to no actual value in the game. Don't get me wrong, Fallout is a fun game and very enjoyable but of everything Bethesda could have done to bring the series forward they decided that a change to the genre was the best option.  Skill system One of the most questionable decisions in Bethesda's new title in the removal of the traditional Fallout skill system, that is a system that allows the player to directly increase the character's abilities through a series of skills. This system has its roots back in the first Fallout and even older RPG titles and the decision to remove was an interesting one. The removal of this system coincides with the decision to transition the game from the traditional ""character skills affect performance in combat"" to ""player skill is the only factor in combat"" (with perhaps perception playing a small role). If you were to look at this system objectively it could be described as simplistic, streamlined and shallow.  RPG Elements The RP aspect of RPG's have always been rich with content since the first title saw its release back in the 90's, most predominantly in the speech options, although Bethesda are not known for their good writing (quite the opposite actually) the switch from complex, amusing and powerful lines to a simple Mass Effect style dialogue wheel was a hit to what the game was always all about, no more is there diverse, verbose dialogue with many options but instead four options, one of which ""good bye"" and the others vague summaries for what the character will actually say, ""sarcastic"" ""compliment"" ""work"" etc. I personally can't say I'm in favour of the change and it practically changes the whole genre of the game, however what I can say free of bias is that this system was only implemented to increase the use ability of a controller on consoles and not to improve the game across all systems, in fact there may very well be a mod in the foreseeable future the reverts this odd system back to a more accurate and PC oriented UI for those playing this on a computer.  Combat I would be lying if I didn't say the combat is a massive improvement over the two previous titles, the thing that bugs me is that they have decided to switch to more of a Far cry or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. system. The thing that differentiated Fallout from just another shooter was the skills and how specialisation was the way to survive, in this it is all about the weapon and not the skill, although some perks increase damage a high level weapon destroys low levelled enemies. New Vegas solved this problem by having a skill requirement to be effective with the weapon so that low levelled characters can't just pick up a .50 and beat the game. A combination of these two systems would have worked better, there was nothing stopping Bethesda from improving combat without culling everything else yet they still decided to over simplify the game for the mainstream market.  We all know why all of this happened, the pressure from console controls and the idea of Bethesda being able to sell the game to everyone again led them down the road of failure as it did to Skyrim and Oblivion. So in the end we are left with a half baked simplification of previous, arguably more competent titles.… Expand "
Icebann,"Dec 18, 2015",6,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Fallout 4 is a fun game, filled with a lot of endless quests and gun play. The problem with Fallout 4 is that it is not really a RPG like the rest of the series. For the majority of the game you will be clearing areas and finding 'bigger and better' loot, and leveling your character to your liking, but that is the game in a nut shell. The only time you have a RPG feel to the game is in the story missions, which in my opinion are short and to the point. There is a lack of universe to this game that would make it one of the best games of all time; it just feels like there should be more game.  I have spent pretty much all of my waking hours not at work on my computer playing this game, and I feel like I'm already done playing it. I really hope that   DLC or mods will expand this game. The only other problem I have with the game is the one sided feeling to it. For the most part, you are a good guy the whole game. In the first few minutes, you are giving power armor, kill a Death Claw, and become the leader of a faction that is in charge of saving the waste land. In short there is no real way to be a bad guy in this game. The darkest you can be in this game is being pissed off that you have to help. If these issues were fixed I would give this game a 10.

The initial release of the game was SOOO exciting for me, and I was met with a dilemma a couple weeks after playing the game a bit. Get this, I bought an Xbox One JUST to play Fallout 4 because my laptop isn't strong enough to handle the game in its full glory; I loved the last 2 fallout titles so much that I didn't need to play the game to know it was incredible and full of gameplay.  But I was wrong.  At first, I was amazed by all of the new mechanics. I didn't particularly care for how they changed VATs, power armor, level up system, or how the every-playthrough-worthy companion Dogmeat was reduced to a dumb ass german shepard whose sole purpose is to get in the way of your walking path and line of fire, or the ""Legendary Items"" system. What they focused on were the aesthetics of the game- a giant, seemingly full map full of variety, and remodeling the creatures and weapons, and they left out crucial components that made Fallout 3, New Vegas, and even Skyrim amazingly fun, high-replay value games.  After 2 weeks of playing it and accumulating around a hundred hours of gameplay, I stopped my wishful thinking that the game would get better and realized that they RUINED fallout. There were always missions and items that I had fun doing and obtaining solely from the knowledge and experience of my last playthrough, which added life to the game. For instance, in New Vegas, I always got Chance's Knife, Love and Hate, and the YCS gauss rifle as soon as I started the game- they were my favorite weapons in every playthrough, and were as powerful as the skill points I assigned to them were- much like The Terrible Shotgun in Fallout 3, or how I walked to get dogmeat immediately after entering the wasteland. There were plenty of unique items and interactions  that I thoroughly enjoy and remember from both of those games- I could go on for hours and hours. The point being, the variety of experiences kept my interest peaked for long periods of time, and with so much to do in one save, it was never dull to see or do those things again, maybe differently in the next playthrough.  Fallout 4 demolished that value. I played fallout 3 all the way through countless times, totaling about 1200 hours of gameplay. I played New Vegas almost 40 times- totaling abut 1600 hours. I played skyrim until I just simply couldn't have a new experience- for over 2500 hours.  I.  F***ing.  Love.  Bethesda.  But fallout 4 is soooooo monotonous. They made a map that was way too big to fill and they bit off more than they could chew filling it with unique things to do. The glowing sea for instance takes up about 1/8th of the total map and literally the only thing there is a high chance to spawn monsters. There are no unique items to tiptoe through hordes of deathclaws to, nor are there even any items to pick up for that matter. Its a walkthrough gallery of CGI garbage- literally. There is a giant city, FULL of locations to discover and massive buildings, but most of them have nothing more than low-level enemies and scrap in them.  When it comes down to it, the most substantial amount of your time with fallout 4 is collecting BS so that you can build a crappy settlement that serves no real purpose but to house your mounds upon mounds of worthless loot and trading for ammo which always seems to be in short supply- no matter how powerful your weapon- another bothersome aspect. I can't simply walk to Evergreen Mills and get myself a legendary weapon that is universally good against enemies, I have to make due with the OKAY weapons that you need a ton of parts and leveling to improve.  The story of this game is trash. ""Like, dude, what if in fallout 4, instead of a son wanting to venture out of the safety of the vault to find his dad, we had a dad in a vault he didn't want to be in venture out to find his son?"" On that note, I think enough is said. The idea of the institute and androids being connected- is just forced. It would be like finding out your dad was the leader of the enclave in fallout 3. It's just stupidly unoriginal.  And to top off the rest of the disappointments, the season pass was about as worthless to improving the game as possible. It just forced a bunch of impractical devices and patch-worthy new items into the crafting menu, and included 2 very small, clearly rushed expansion packs known as Far Harbor and Nuka World. The rest of the DLCs were low-interest settlement upgrades that people would have just modded into the damn game if they really wanted them.  THAT is why I think it deserves a 1/10. One point for keeping my stupid, gullible ass occupied for about 250 hours. Had they released the DLC all at once, I would have stopped after realizing there was nothing more to come. Here is 5000 characters worth of what I think of Fallout 4, summarized:  OVERHYPED MEDIOCRITY… Expand "

MartysWasteland,"Jan 19, 2016",2,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I have enjoyed many Bethesda and Fallout games and was rather interested yet critical about this game going in. I expected a fun world with a fun new combat system. What I got was a game that fails even at what was advertised (the combat) and what was to be expected from a Bethesda game (fun world). First off the story has an extreme problem handling emotions. What do I mean? Well at the start of the game your wife gets killed (or husband depending on what sex you choose at the start of the game) and you only have had one conversation prior to death about going to a park. You have no connection to the death and are supposed to care deeply for your son who was kidnapped. Later in the game you meat Kellogg which throws another ""emotion"" problem. What is the problem? Well the problem is your character cares so deeply for your kid he screams and curses at Kellogg no matter what dialogue you choose. As a character to little to no personality in other quest now all of sudden takes this set protagonist part is crazy. You have a massive player and character disconnect beyond belief. Also no matter what Kellogg will kill you or you him, but Bethesda tries to make you feel for this guy who did nothing good in a memory (thing?). Which would have been great if they established that he was ""troubled"" and gave you a sort of a benny amount of choices to kill or not kill him. Imagine if you were given the chance and Kellogg showed some emotions before hand--it would have been great, but Bethesda failed to that. The combat is a selling point for this game yet it is nothing of note. It is an objective upgrade handling and mechanically yet the enemy variety, weapons, and overall intrigue in the combat just isn't present. The world is another selling point, but sadly Bethesda forgot what made locations fun to discover and play around with. In this game everything is randomly generated besides a few unique weapons & FCs, so you have no real motive to go into these locations. However if they had fun and unique stories to tell it would have been different right? Well yep, but only 2 times I recall in which has that been the case. Most of the stories are about random uninteresting pre war stories. The staples of the Fallout series side quest, role playing, and lore are all ruined in this game also. Lore inconsistences are everyplace. Vertibirds being prewar, cats being alive, jet being prewar, and another FEV return. The quest are almost always besides 2 quest (gliding grasshopper & covenant) go to the place and kill that/get me that. The dialogue a pillar of role playing is not only glitchy it is broken to its core. It often gives you 4 options and 3 of them mean the exact same thing. No, yes, sarcastic, and ask a question. Sarcastic which is something that describes something should have been ""sarcastic yes"". Other times the dialogue fails is when sarcastic turns into rage against someone (like valentine in memory d). The only real choices in the dialogue system are the obvious ""which faction are you going to choose""  and sadly that is it. I could go on forever and will when I do my YouTube review on my YouTube channel (That Marty Fella). Today though I will just leave it at I think this a terrible game and disserves all the hate it is getting.… Expand "

A huge let down from all the hype, learn your lesson - don't get excited for a game, no matter who the developers are. I just hope this isn't the future of Bethesda Game Studios games. To me Fallout 4 is like stabbing myself in the leg and trying to convince myself it feels fine.  Just found out: FALLOUT 4 USES MANY OF THE SAME TEXTURES AS FALLOUT 3. I mean *COME ON* BGS! Are you SERIOUS?!  (Copy and pasted stuff from my Steam review.) - It's a half/half game, it's good and bad. Story is horrible - gameplay is good. Personal character is horrible - NPCs are good. RPG is gone - shooter takes its place. To me this game feels like a spin-off of Fallout, kind of similiar to how FNV is to F3. There's a lot wrong but it makes up for with various aspects. Lore is once again messed up, it honestly doesn't even feel like a Fallout game if it weren't for the Deathclaws and BoS, those are the only two things that make F4 feel like Fallout. No player freedom like we were given in previous games, referring to TES and Fallout, we obviously have the freedom to roam around the wasteland but other than that it's nothing.  - This is less of a RPG game and more of an open-world shooter. Bethesda wanted to do new and innovative stuff, while they accomplished most of it they failed to keep true to what the game is. The one thing they failed exceptionally at was the dialogue system, it fails to do what even other studios failed at. Voice acting is alright but doesn't fit in - and that isn't me being a nostalgic silent protagonist, it just truly doesn't work. Let me give an example, you can join whatever faction you want right, true. When you join the BoS you're a tough militaristic and devoted soldier to the BoS and their tenets. However when you're roaming the wasteland searching for your damn son you're a father figure and continue to act as such. In addition you can join the Minuteman and other factions - all of which your character acts accordingly. Getting the picture? One second you act like a loyal soldier, the next you're a father, then you're a passive smuggling rebel. It just flows so awkwardly. To go back to the system itself - like I said - it fails horribly. Yes, No, Maybe, Info/Sarcastic. What is this BGS? What the hell do you call that? Screw it, in the end it doesn't even matter because all of them mean ""yes"" anyways.  - No choices, no consequences, nothing that made Fallout great is in Fallout 4.  - Back on mods though, BGS in it's entirety SHOULD NOT rely on modders to make their games good. It's no wonder they're making mods available across all platforms, it makes sense now. They feel they're allowed to half-ass the games now because we modders will fix it and make it better, therefore allowing them to slack off. I'm still waiting for their plans to return to paid-mods, I can see it now it'll be with Fallout 4. But not going to relight a fire, on to something else.  - For some reason I'll put the story here. It's bad. It doesn't even feel like any thought went into it, it's the exact same as Fallout 3 except the roles are reversed. Nearly the same god damn thing. You leave the Vault, go to a large wasteland city, find people to help, continue searching, find someone that knows something about where your goal is, convince them to help, meet your goal and find out that they're really the leader of something massive. Done, bam. Hell, I enjoyed a CoD series more than this, dafuq? Now after the aforementioned story you go on to faction stories and whom to support. FACTION STORIES HAVE ONLY TWO MAIN QUESTS. ALL OF WHICH ARE THE SAME. And that's it. That's Fallout 4. Alright, alright - I forgot to mention that almost all missions in between the beginning from the end are filler side op missions, get this, kill them, repeat. If you thought Skyrim was bad then you're in for a surprise when it comes to this. There is hardly ANY side missions. Yes I know the side op missions I just mentioned are actually called side missions and are considered missions themselves but that doesn't cut it, that's just **** Those side op missions belong in the misc missions not a mission themselves. I understand that not all missions can be long and drawn out quests that are their own entire story, there needs to be a balance between the two, Fallout 4/BGS just didn't do that. The misc missions far over-number the amount of actual missions. And it just doesn't work that way. Nothing is fun about it, hell you don't even go to new places they send you back to the same locations.

Your skills are now useless in conversations.You need X amount of charisma, thats it.NV was so much better when you feel the build of your character matters in some way.  The UI is a desaster!!!Its not only clunky as hell, its hard to navigate without a gamepad.In fights that sucks!THe VATS is a problem too because the time flows when you are in VATS and most of the time its hard to target certain bodyparts with the mouse.  Tactical gameplay is not in this game.When you fight enemys above you level youll simply die.I tried just for fun to lure some tough raiders into a minefield with lots and lots of mines.They took nearly no damage.The scaling of the enemys is terrible.You will find it either too hard or too easy.Pop a dozen of ghouls, no prob, minutes later one raider might run you over.You cant roleplay that way i think and its no fun when a game scales so poorly i think.  I saw some comment the shooting is so much better.Yes, compared to F3 and maybe NV yes but those where no great games.What the hell is your standard?This is clearly no RPG and when i want to play a GREAT FPS i play a great one, not an abomination like Fallout 4.I play Wolfenstein for example with great visuals, great sound and so on!The gunplay is not even ok because everything is so clunky and ugly.So many bad textures that i cant the enemys when they stand next to a **** wall.And the weaponhandling is weird too.I can talk about the framerate too.A great FPS runs with a constant framerate where i can shoot things with precision.Fallout 4 runs NOT smooth.If you think Fallout 4 is an ok shooter go and play Wolfenstein or Shadow Warrior!!!!  Bugs!!!Bugs!!!Bugs!!!I had some issues with bugs.Power armor is bugged as hell.The HUD is not displaying anything for example!According to my HUD in the armor i have no ammo, no health, no fusion core.This is **** bugs are there, companions fell through the terrain and died(they came back after i fasttraveld) and so on.  The crafting seems nice, at first.Until you realize that you can just wait when enemys drop better stuff.This way i had a perfect 10mm after hours without wasting resources.I had to build the basic addon, on another weapon of the same model, trade the pieces, done.I have done that with most of my equipment and i had upgrades that needed the last ranks of weaponsmith for example when i was on a low level.That is just bad design because Bethesda makes it so some res are artificially rare and expensive.With my way you dont need that ressources.Should never be that way cause the crafting is a way for YOU to determine the way you want to play.Thats the plan from bethesda i think and they screwed this up.  Visuals are pretty bad.Who gives this piece of ugly garbage a 95??Of course, IGN.Cause they had no bugs and a brilliant looking game i guess.The engine is outdated and they say its new.Lie!!!  Conclusion:Boring as **** with bugs, clunky UI, no story, no immersion in the world and they dumbed down EVERYTHING.The 4 way dialogue-wheel is the nail in the coffin.Without the bugs the game might be a 2.With the bugs its 1, barely, because you can start it.I was never that bored when i played a game.Bethesda, you suck.You suck at writing, at programming and at building world where RPG players can immerse themselfes.All the people that think this is a great game:You suck, i dont care if you allowed to have an own oppinion.You are a person without taste!!!… Expand "
Vilmar,"Nov 20, 2015",5,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I've waited for the game for quite a while. I can't say I hated it, but I heavily disliked it.  1. New character progression. Perk tree is OK and nice, absence of skills bugged me a lot. This leads to point 2 - 2. Skill checks. What happened to good old RPG communication? What's up with all those 4 tiny-weeny choices? I made a mistake replaying New Vegas before release, and that set me off even more. Yes | No (Yes) | Maybe (Yes later) | Sarcastic 3. Weapons. I kinda like not having a need to repair a weapon, though it is just my preference and it was a nice touch, being in a world after atomic annihilation. New combat system makes it too un-fallouty. I used VATS only a few times to get rid of pesky fast bugs and damage some rare challenging enemies. Other times I would feel simple shooting would suffice. 4. Missions. God dammit, what's all those ""help the settlement"", ""find tech"", ""sweep someplace"", ""place some sensors"" missions? I can't remember being that annoyed, there have to be other ways of exploring places and progressing a character other than those... 5. Main point. Story.  When I just started looking for Shaun, I immediately thought ""Gosh, it would be such a cliche if Shaun turned out to be and old man, working for institute. Haha, no way this is so simple. Well **** I waited patiently to see some interesting development after I met Father. Nope. Nothing. The fraction opposition is also horrid. I was on good terms with them until the very end. I then had to abandon being a Paladin to secure the catalyst. Ok, I lived with that, it would be hard to get the young Elder working with me as the Institute head. Hey, I can still help Railroad to get out the synths, and then lead Institute to glory, me being an Institute head? Nope. No compromises. Go massacre your Railroad friends, or blow up the place with great technological advancements to help the humanity. WHY?  Still, it has good old Fallout vibe, and I will be returning to the game to explore new locations outside this horrid main story. The game is not a masterpiece, but is still worth playing.… Expand "

juliiouse,"Jan 12, 2016",4," Although I am a massive fan of previous Fallout games (even Fallout 3), after logging two different playthroughs on Fallout 4, I can honestly say it's the weakest entry in the series and one of the worst games I have played all year.  Compared to previous Fallout games, the gameplay has been massively dumbed down. Even compared to the likes of Skryim the game feels simplistic. TheAlthough I am a massive fan of previous Fallout games (even Fallout 3), after logging two different playthroughs on Fallout 4, I can honestly say it's the weakest entry in the series and one of the worst games I have played all year.  Compared to previous Fallout games, the gameplay has been massively dumbed down. Even compared to the likes of Skryim the game feels simplistic. The SPECIAL system has been rendered inconsequential because you can put points into your SPECIAL stats by simply levelling up and there is no level cap. If you dump points into Intelligence at the start you can be 10/10'd in every stat within the first few hours. The skill system has been taken out and merged with perks, which means you'll never really have to consider your build and can just choose perks in whatever weapon type you fancy using that day. Since most decent weapons can be collected off ""legendary"" mobs or found in crates and you'll very rarely be troubled by locks or computers compared to previous games, levelling combat perks is all you need to do for success.  Consequences and morals have also either been removed or dumbed down massively. Instead of the karma system which tracked your general moral standing and a complex factional reputation system, your standing within the gameworld is now only tracked by an utterly broken companion relationship system. Simply put, there just isn't gravity for your actions. Preston- a man dedicated to protecting his settlers and restoring peace to the Commonwealth- was standing with me when I butchered a whole settlement of his followers and stole their stuff. He didn't blink twice and helped me kill them. Later he was offended when I pickpocketed a hostile NPC but makes quips the whole time when you rob the dead. I then got his relationship back to max with me by taking the supressor on and off a gun ten times in a row. Charisma checks are also a waste of time now. They either give you a small increase in the money you get from quests or a small amount more background information into what you're doing. You'll never see any real benefits. The few times it's used to avoid combat have no consequences in the future. The NPCs stop being relevent the second their place in your character's quest are done with.  Killing people is generally your only option and there is very little in the way of branching paths. You either agree to do a quest or don't and it'll be added into your quest log anyway. Compare and contrast to New Vegas which gives you a massively different tone and experience and style of quest depending on the decisions you make. This year we've seen The Witcher 3 and Undertale, two games which have handled consequences for your actions and interaction with the player character infinitely better than Fallout 4 has.  Though I was skeptical at the ""more personal"" story that is offered up by Bethesda this time round, I was willing to give it a chance, but all it has done is restrict the backstory and roleplay potential you have. Unlike New Vegas, which gives you a personal motive of revenge and then opens you up to a grand, region changing plot, Fallout 4 gives you a personal motive that hardly evolves beyond that.  Graphically, the game is pretty bad. The textures are slightly worse than Skyrim and the clothing is especially awful. Faces can be good or bad depending on the character and it all looks a little jarring. Terrains look very blurred even on ultra graphics, and NPCs can blend into the landscape due to the lack of any real sharpening. Other minor points include the lack of weapon holstering and terrible lip synching.  Outside of the dummied out stat and level progression system, there is little in the way of improvement. Combat feels a little meatier but melee builds are rendered worthless because NPCs can stunlock you by bashing you with their guns and shooting you down. Stealth is as uninspiring as it was in previous games.  The AI is still wonky as well.  One of the few significant changes is the settlement system which feels more like a poorly implemented Nexus mod rather than an actually important part of the game. One of the few improvements I appreciated was the new modding system.  Performance is terrible at the moment. Loading times are an embarassment and framerates are very unstable despite the poor graphics.  Maybe the game will be good in a year or so, but for now there is very little good I can say about the game  . The only reason I am not giving this 1/10 is the sound direction is pretty good.… Expand "

It never expands more than that when you first started it in the beginning of the game. You could spend hours of building and decorating your settlement but serve no function other than wasting your time from playing the actual game (which was why they made it in the first place) to make it seem like there's ""hours"" of content. Bethesda could've added more dynamic features in the settlement system but didn't and expect the modding community to build from it's barebones they've given us. Exploration/Towns: Everywhere you go, everything you do is the same rinse and repeat. You find a location, kill enemies and loot (which is the core mechanic in the game yet it's the most boring thing to do?). It's an open world but there's nothing interesting to do other than walking around, killing **** and leveling up (I'm gonna talk more about this abomination of a system). None of the areas you visit aren't memorable (Even the towns) and more likely will never go back except for resources you need to build **** (and I'll talk about this as well). Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim had many locations that were memorable and had interesting backstories of how it came to be, hell even girdershade from fallout 3 was more interesting than most of the areas of Fallout 4. Bethesda concentrated of making the world of Fallout 4 as big as it could be and ignoring details that came with it. I would rather have a detail world than a large one (That's what she said). Leveling/perks: You can play a certain play style for a bit of time before you start to gain enough experience to ""level"" up and allocate the point into areas you're weak in. Over time, you'll become proficient (god tier) in every perk and the play style will now become a freedom of choice instead of dealing your characters' weaknesses in areas they don't excel greatly and try to overcome their cons with their pros. The perks are a joke and are stretched out to increase the level cap to satisfy peoples' level fetishes and again to make it seem like there's ""hours"" of content when you don't have all the perks filled up. Bethesda did this to appeal to wider range of audiences who don't like to be limited and have the ability to change to a new different playstyle at will, because making the game as a casual as it could be will make more money for us! **** YOU BETHESDA. Weapon Crafting: In my honest opinion, I feel that the damage modifications on the weapons don't even count towards the 50 base weapons with over 700 modified versions of the weapons, those are necessary when facing higher level enemies. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas had skills which increased the damage output as well as the accuaracy of a weapon when you put points into the combat skills such as ""Small Guns"" F3 or ""Guns"" FNV. There wasn't much variety of options to change how the gun behave (other than mods that let you put any weapon modification) in Fallout 4 other than basic ones such as increased clip sizes instead of shooting modes or weapon degradation (F3 and FNV). They had the base but didn't add the other extra features which was replaced by the borderland inspired legendary weapons, Woohoo...  Quests(****ing Radiant)/Voice Dialogue: If they just didn't concentrated on the voice acting of the male and female protagonist we could've had a better well written story line instead of the flip roles from Fallout 3 (They really thought out the main quest line through with that >.>). The story was bland and predictable but not as worse as those radiant quests which serve no purpose other than (say it with me) wasting your time to make it seem like there's ""hours"" and ""endless"" content. They had an interesting concept of machines acting and thinking like humans and could've use that as twist for the main character being one of them the whole time but that's Bethesda for you.  There is one thing that has bother so much ever since I started playing Fallout 4 and no it's not the radiant quests or the birth of the Preston Garvey meme, it's this mother****ing old ass creation engine they ""updated"" to use for Fallout 4 even though they CLEARLY had enough money (triple A company)in the budget to afford a brand new game engine but instead, wanted to beat a ****ing 7 year old rotten dead horse locked away inside Bethesdas' prison (fetish) dungeon.

That said, the content in the game feels extremely boring. 90% of the missions are basically ""shoot those guys and bring back that item"", the characters and companions are either unengaging or obnoxious (with possible exception of the dog). The main storyline is simply not engaging (maybe because it's been told a million times in other games already), and all the endings feel lackluster.  The dialogue system has been dulled down significantly, with your dialogue choices having little to no effect, you might as well just spam the left arrow to sound sarcastic all the time. And you've never have a complete understanding of what you're going to say, because each choice is represented by a single word and there is no ability to see the phrase your character is going for (unlike DXHR, for example).  The absence of the level cap is nice, but perk system is a double-edged sword: while you can get just the perks you want, their higher-level versions are locked behind a level wall, forcing you to spread your skillpoints over a myriade of skills which you don't need or want.  The settlements mechanic is completely useless, unless you are the person who would rather have AI play their game for them.

F4 certainly has not changed my opinion of Bethesda games; They're like junk food. They taste good and sometimes you get a craving for them, but they ultimately leave you feeling empty and unsatisfied.  I don't particularly want to rant about every detail I didn't like in this game, but there are some things I feel I need to talk about. The game has no challenge worth mentioning, unless you consider chipping away at bullet-sponges to be a rewarding experience. Similar to the Super Mutants of Fallout 3, Deathclaws have been downgraded from how they used to be and are now the new ""Generic roaming tough-guy enemy"" (Even though they shouldn't be roaming in the first place). Just like Skyrim, NPC's dump meaningless and unwanted quests in your journal if you even so much as hear them whispering in the distance. You're expected to do everything for everybody and it gets tiresome quickly. Example: One of the most common side quests is to clear out a spot that would make a good new settlement. Generally the person giving you the quest will say something like ""I've got some friends who want to move in there"". So you clear out the place, report back, and 2 settlers will move in to their new home. However, they do nothing when they arrive. They won't set up a farm, beds, defences or even attempt to clean the place up. Despite being told that these settlers wanted to move in once this piece of land was cleared out, they are perfectly happy to just sit there and starve to death until you come back and build up the place for them. What exactly was their plan for the place they asked you to clear out for them? I really can't stand how incompetent everybody is in Bethesda games. Also these kinds of quests are pretty much unlimited, so even if you do take the time to build up settlements for people, there is no sense of progression because you're immediately bogged down with 3 or 4 more of the same quest (Literally, as many of the quest-givers have a nasty habit of giving you 3 or 4 more quests before they allow you to turn in the ones you've already finished). At the time of writing this review, the GECK is not available so mod support is limited and as of December 7th 2015, an update was added which removed what little mod support the game already had (So long, Pre-war house). On that note, I don't understand why rebuilding pre-war stuff is not an option. When it was revealed that you were a pre-war survivor and military veteran, I figured that you having pre-war knowledge would become a big deal in the game. In FNV I remember someone saying that mining machines are tricky to use because nobody alive has the knowledge to repair them, or rebuild them if they ever completely break down. Not to mention HELIOS 1. But no, your characters status as a pre-war survivor is meaningless. He/she rarely even mentions it, he/she can't even sweep the piles of leaves and rubble out of his/her home. But hey, that's my fault for expecting more depth from a Bethesda game, I don't know why I keep trying.  Please excuse the wall of text, but I assure you, that was the short-list.  If you already got Fallout 4 on release, chances are you've finished it and moved on, so I'm really just writing this review for anybody who's still undecided about getting F4. This is certainly not Fallout New Vegas. It doesn't even have a Hardcore mode (Despite carrying over Skyrim's cooking system). I've been told that F4 started out as a mod for Skyrim and it sure feels like it. You really won't miss much by waiting for this game to go on sale, maybe in the form of the GOTY edition, when full modding support is available.… Expand "

SocratesPOV,"Oct 18, 2016",5," Fallout 4 is the showcase of what happens when developers spend more for merchandising than actual game development.  Graphics and physics are the same since Fallout 3 but what did you expect, right? If you can get through the gory paste and gummy bodies and, yes, some fresh post processing, worry not, this game has many more aces in the hole to disappoint you!    Let's start with theFallout 4 is the showcase of what happens when developers spend more for merchandising than actual game development.  Graphics and physics are the same since Fallout 3 but what did you expect, right? If you can get through the gory paste and gummy bodies and, yes, some fresh post processing, worry not, this game has many more aces in the hole to disappoint you!  Let's start with the few good things about Fallout 4: Boston and its outskirt are big and it takes quite some time to explore the whole map, there is variety and i personally liked the glowing sea as it feels like the apotheosis of atomic annihilation. From the FPS perspective this game got far from his previous chapters as it now features more control over envirorment while shooting (peeking from cover for instance). Character customization, aesthetically speaking, have been improved. This said, roll up your sleeves, we are going deeper.  From the RPG perspective the game feels hollow: personally the voice acting of the main character wasn't necessary as it rips away whatever you wanted to imagine it was the voice of your character, although the acting is not that bad. The dialog circle is terrifying: the option swings from ""good answer"" to ""bad answer"" to the ominous ""sarcasting answer"", never in all the 3 cases you have an idea of what your character is going to say, you can vaguely imagine but you can't be sure. Thankfully modders fixed this. Hardcore mode, introduced in NV, disappeared, making this title look more like a walk in a theme park than a survivalish RPG in a ravaged wasteland. The choices you make sometime matters but in the big picture you have 4 endings and they all look the same, you just swap Preston with whoever is the leader of the faction you chose. Speaking of Preston there is a settlement that require your aid, General... Preston is just one of the many npcs who offer a series of repetitive quest which require you to go to ""X"" slay ""Y enemies"" go back, rinse and repeat. There are some engaging quest  lines indeed but there are so few compared to the 3-line-of-dialog-repeated-x-times quests.  Technically as stated graphics and physics are docked safely at Fallout 3, there are very few moments of awe while walking the wasteland;  the tree, grass, waters and whatever debris of the old world remain still as if the bombs deprived the world of atmosfere, leaving it windless. Entering every building has a loading screen and while this not being a big problem it still feel silly being this game released the same year as The Witcher 3 (or MGSV:TPP if you will) which doesn't have any loading time and is still a huge world much more vibrant and detailed than Fallout 4. Game difficulty is nothing to meddle with since it will not make the game a real challenge but will, instead, transform enemies in walking brickmen who need several clips before you down them or, if you are too sluggish to unload hell on some random raiders , get shotted by any silenced weapon with a couple of perks.  To conclude, Fallout 4 is , in my opinion, an under developed game who sold out more because of it's name than his qualitative gameplay. It's an ""ok"" game but absolutely not worth 60€… Expand "

I would consider the voiced protagonist to be a minor issue if it weren't for the fact that the voice actors for both the male and the female are the least committed bad guys ever. You cannot be evil in Fallout 4, at the very worst you are kind of a douche.  Add this to the fact that Bethesda took out skills and you start to see issues. At level 1 a character with 10 perception and 10 agility is as good at aiming with a rifle as a level 20 character with lots of perks put into small guns. As an avid RPG player I am needless to say quite livid about this.  Ok so no skills, what else is awful about the game? Well, the quests are awful, it's painful terrible writing. The factions are generally awful, several of them start out strong but quickly deteriorate into stupidity and contradictions, and the endings to the game are the most stupid illogical things I have ever seen. In every other Fallout, except maybe 3 to fair, you would have been able to roleplay into a logical ending but in Fallout 4 this is not allowed.  I don't even know if mods can fix this one, at the very least it will maybe make the game more enjoyable to mess around and do nothing in.  Oh and one last gripe, the gun models are absolutely massive. Several of the guns are so huge that they take up at minimal 50% of the right side of your screen. Thanks Bethesda.… Expand "

More like, a ""Purchasing Fallout 4 Survival Guide"" if you get my drift.  I was at first very pleased to see so many franchise reference, it made me think ""Wow they have really stuck to their roots, good on them"". This feeling quickly turned sour as I played through the first hour of the game however. No Hardcore Mode was the first blow, but I saw ""Survival"" mode and thought that seemed awesome. Nope. Survival mode does what it says on the tin, makes enemies survive; absolutely anything. The mode turns everything on the map into a sponge made for bullets, had to mod my game 5 mins in to fix this.  The palette was also too bright but I shrugged it off as 'just a way to please players who are new to the game"" which is fine, everyone needs to start somewhere. So I modded the palette to a darker scheme and moved on.  The annoying xp gain sound effects were back, no problem I thought, just a reference. So I remove the sound with mods and moved on.  I noticed then that the dialogue when communicating is basically limited to ""Say good thing"" ""Say bad thing"" and ""Two other misc choices"". With no proper description of what any of the choices will say. This was the first MAJOR blow for me, as I can't mod away all the dialogue. I mentally gritted my teeth and told myself it was another modernization to appease the modern gamer and that I shouldn't be too bothered by it, Bethesda is a company after all, they need to make money.  Once into the game I actually started enjoying the early game stuff, ammo seemed scarce, too many meds though. To add to this the emotion on the NPCs faces are a massive step up for Bethesda so kudos there.  Again though, I ran into pet peeve after pet peeve. Damage Threshold has been reverted to Damage Resistance, which is an abomination. There are no diverse ammo types and no weapon condition, making the whole game feel like a lazy shooter by Activision instead of a deep and engaging Bethesda RPG. It's like the literally tore everything good out of Fallout 3 and New Vegas and left the bare bones with a few figurative shreds of meat left on the skeleton. These being the fact that Vaults exist and the obscure references to older games that were beginning to seem like a desperate post development effort to appease fanboys that love complaining such as myself.  I'm all for new features, I don't like the settlement building or the silly power armor that feels like I am inside a massive tin can with a death ray attached to my arm; in a Fallout game. But I understand that some players do, and I can just ignore those aspects for the most part. But stripping back everything about the franchise that made old fans love the Fallout universe is just unacceptable.  Despite all this. I would like to mention a few really great aspects of the game that are actually keeping me playing. The weapon modifications are brilliant; so is the fact that I can gather materials through scrapping old weapons and armor. I even like the idea of farming quite a bit as it gives a chance to feel accepted in the unforgiving wasteland. In older games I always felt like a wandering raider, so it's nice to have that option. The gunplay is also much better than previous titles. Giving me a dog at the start hit my weak spot too, I mean that thing is deadly cute. To add to this, I love the return of alternate ways to accomplish tasks. I had a bit of a molerat problem in a scrapyard I was looting and instead of killing the buggers, I summoned a giant sentry bot, using the power of intellect, to clean up for me. I then proceeded to salvage it's parts with my Pipe Rifle.  All in all, Fallout 4 is a decent game in it's own right. If you've never played Fallout before I think you will love it, especially if you like titles such as Borderlands and Mad Max (Side note: I love Borderlands more than life). However, if you're a fan of previous Fallout titles, you like S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and feel like older games you've played are sacred and should be preserved in the sequel. I suggest waiting for the mod tools next year and letting some whiny nerd like myself nitpick all the crap out and make Fallout great again.  The best way to explain why I do not enjoy Fallout 4 is to say that. If Bethesda removed all the references to older games and left just the mechanics and basic playstyle. Then changed the name to ""Uncle-Openworld's World of Open Guntimes"", I would not have said ""Hm, this plays a lot like Fallout"".  I'm proud of anyone who got through that whole review, collect your Endurance Bobblehead on your way out.

The perk chart is such a failed excuse at character progression it isn't even funny. i mean, seriously. If this is considered an RPG then I guess call of duty is too, since that game has perks in it. No skills, no important dialogue choices, no karma system. The only thing this game actually improves upon from it's predecessors is gunplay. Shooting feels great, but that's all that feels great in this game. Like this game was built around it. Stealth has gone out this window, why be sneaky when you can go in with power armor and a minigun(that u get 5 minutes into the game), and rape face? The aforementioned perk chart means this game has NO replayability. After the first playthrough I was bored, the game lacked so much depth and content that I felt like I had already done everything. The only thing different I did in my second playthrough was the difficulty setting. Even on Very Hard/survival, All I need to do is save up enough caps and raise the charisma perks enough where i can just buy a bunch of fusion cores and play the whole game in power armor, which makes everything a breeze. Fps is capped at 30/60, and forget about uncapping it. going over 80/90fps severely breaks the game. Overall the game just looks and runs like **** compared to skyrim modded(my framerate sometimes drops to low 20's when in the city, and I have a gtx 970 and a fx-8370, running 1080p without godrays), jetpack breaks the game, followers are useless, AI sucks, bugs galore, gimmicky settlement building, 8 seconds to quick switch weapons, horrible voice acting, bland predictable and uninteresting story, lots of hype around the ""10,000 different names are said in the game"" thing but the only thing that says names is that cocksworth robot, In an apocolyptic wasteland Loot(especially ammo) is everywhere, follower disposition is annoying and limiting, power armor runs on fusion cores even though the lore is that power armor fusion cores last like 10,000 years, T-60 is nowhere in the lore, overpowered legendary weapons/armor, instantly accepted into the brotherhood as a knight after paladin danse gives you his most prized possession shortly after meeting you, small map(no, the buildings(which by the way every single one has at the most 3 floors total since you can take an elevator all the way to the top/bottom)do not make up for it), The list just goes on and on and on and on... and on... and on...

Truly a cutthroat blockbuster video game. A relic wrapped in plastic. And not to mention it signifies the end of an incredible era of complex and immersive RPG's.  It doesn't really even belong in the same category or genre as the rest of the franchise, as it is not an RPG. If I had wanted some sort of skill based open world FPS, this would have delighted me endlessly. It is one of the best open world FPS's of all time. But unfortunately, the reason fallout is a cultural phenomenon has nothing to do with graphics or shooting, or any of that other stuff that we get from every other console and pc game in the world.  We care about fallout because of the endlessly satisfying, deeply funny, complex, often enlightening and utterly human CONTENT and story that the world of fallout offered. It was one of the oldest stories ever told, and told with such cleverness and wit! It is IMMERSION we are striving for. Realism, mythology and fantasy colliding in morally complex, ambiguous and thoughtful ways.  Deep down, this is what matters. This is why Fallout is what it is today, and also why those in charge of making Fallout 4 were able to trick an insanely real, and awesome, core fan base out of their series by generalizing every aspect of complexity that the other games in the series had to offer (by the boatload). Not being an extreme gamer, I now have to research other RPG's to death and hopefully find another company with a better understanding of their own video games. I loved Morrowind, Fallout 3, and everything in between. But I always assumed they would fix the little issues while making the foundation of the game's platform as an RPG stronger. Unfortunately, it is becoming far too obvious that each subsequent release (besides a few, I loved NV) becomes less interesting, immersive, unique, and complex than the previous installation. Instead of building their worlds thicker, they stripped them down. I wonder, do they even see their games the way that we do? Do they love their games like we love them? The only logical conclusion is: no, of course they don't. Sure some of the smaller fish that actually do the work must have known what a train wreck the game had become. But the company clearly has grown too large, and no longer has an interest in the series, but rather now simply has an interest in creating wealth just like any other faceless corporation.  Welcome to the era of billion dollar video gaming. Just like blockbuster films - you cannot expect integrity or quality from these monolithic companies anymore. They are merely working to build an engine that suits everyones needs. They created an easy, soft, and nonaggressive video game experience. Yet, it is honestly not worth even getting frustrated over. We have all been watching this happen for a while now. Everything that rises must converge, eh? So, crying out, we quiet down. There is nothing to critique with the interest in saving future series installations in mind. Because, hey, they won! The loads of money that they have already made is nearly historic. So we are left with our memories and that is fine. We just have to wait for the next young company to come along. Ambitious and alive, ready to create the new era of character based immersion gaming.  Goodbye Fallout. You were truly amazing.… Expand "

Should tell you all you really need to know about how numbers are being ""manipulated"" and by whom. (I've also no doubt that Xbox and PS4 users come into the PC rating section to try and ""boost"" them because they love their consoles, but that's another story)  The LONG version (for those who aren't ADHD and can read)  I've played Fallout since the very first one, and I remember grabbing it off the shelf and being excited for a new type of RPG. Ever since the first, I've welcomed each one on it's own merit- because I enjoy the story, the RPG elements such as being able to customize your skills and story as you go. The Skilldex system was innovative, especially being able to develop not only strengths but flaws and weaknesses along the way, making each character unique. Combine this with an evolving, unfolding story and you have an awesome experience, even if your character suffers a tragic death as a result of a mistake you made. You feel invested in the game, the NPC's you meet all have some sort of story as well, and most oftentimes a need of some sort. You can choose to align or be maligned, you can choose to do whatever you please along the way. Fallout 3 came along with a new FPS style interface, which at first was revolutionary combined with RPG elements, but it worked. I learned to like it, as I've played FPS games as well, and loved the combination of Fallout's RPG system being integrated. The ability for modders to create content and introduce it was also welcomed- which then continued with Fallout New Vegas with it's different story but very similar design of interface.  Then comes Fallout 4.... a dumbed-down, consolized interface, lack of choice in almost any respect except for which weapon you choose and where you go. Perk system is a joke. Gone are the days of making choices that matter, gone are the days of feeling invested in the story in any respect. Now it's basically Call of Duty with a Fallout skin applied to it. It feels generic, dialogue system is horrid, and it randomly crashes to desktop without any hint or clue as to why. I play Fallout New Vegas on the same machine, with 120+ mods loaded and it (almost) NEVER crashes. (When it does, it's obvious as to why) Even those with high end equipment have issues with this game running stable at a decent speed. There's really no excuse whatsoever for a AAA developer to release a game in such a state. (but I'm sure fanbois will continue to defend this, too.)  Two words for anyone considering purchasing this game for PC - ""Caveat Emptor"" (Buyer Beware). Don't say you weren't warned. Wait until the modders have released decent content and Bethesda (whenever they get around to it) releases a few patches to make the game stable. This release has also seriously made me question whether I'll invest in any of Bethesda's releases in the future- even TES which is another series I've always loved. I've no problem with choice- if you want to play on your console, play on your console- but developing crappy ports to PC and expecting PC users to put up with it will warrant poor consumer scores.  Finally to those who question the ""validity"" of such reviews ask yourself a question-  What does any customer who has bought this game and rates it poorly have to gain? IMO, absolutely nothing. They sure as hell aren't knocking down my door offering a refund.  So what does any customer who has bought this game and rates it high have to lose?… Expand "

I'm pigeonholed into a stereotypical white picket fence Mr. Jones character, and that's honestly lame as **** and something that i never would have picked on my own.  I remember Todd Howard saying that the dialogue options wouldn't be limited despite the fact that they went for a voiced protagonist , so either he was lying or is just delusional. Everything in the game i come across feels forced and bland and i honestly can't play the game anymore. It feels like the project started with soul and passion because there are some traces of it still in the game, such as the Dunwitch area. However in the end they did the same thing to the fallout series that they did to Skyrim, except to an even greater extent. That being; ripping all of the soul and passion from the world in favor of lazy randomization and the legendary system, which is just an excuse for them to not design custom weapons or put any backstory into most locations of the game.  A small upside is that the base engine and overall game has a lot of potential for improvement with mods. The shooting and actual combat is far improved from the other titles. The fact that they are also making consoles mod compatible leads me to believe that they knew this game wasn't going to live up to the fans' expectations, and were content to let unpaid modmakers place all of the heart into the game.  Ultimately, I was really disappointed with this game, and it sucks after waiting for it for seven years. And at this point i don't really have any hope with future titles from Bethesda because they've ****ed my two favorite series with their latest installments, looking to appeal to the broadest audience possible, and make the most money possible. Rather than you know, making genuine pieces of art as they did with the others.… Expand "

Unlike many i'm not bitter about graphics game looks aesthetic enough and unlike older game it more stable: i never experienced a CTD. Still game is not optimised, not at all. I play Battlefront at ultra with solid 30fps yet with Fallout 4 i'm having horrible FPS drops from time to time; some locations like infamous corvega factory, simply kills the system.  While game is much stable than previous Bethesda games, number of quest are bugged astonishing: quest givers attack you for wearing PA or using particular helmet upgrade, not doing some quests in certain order breaks other quests and even in extreme cases game prevents you from requiting a companion that's not related to him at all.  Big downer of the game is of all Bethesda and Fallout games it's with the least freedom. All of the games have always provided with a blank state, for example in Fallout and Fallout 3 our character was a Vault resident yet his job, character and sexuality was never told before player started to choose skills.  In older games except for Fallout 3(partly) player freedom was top priority, you could be someguy with high charisma and luck as some car salesmanlike guy who wins every game at the gasino and solves his problem with his tongue(literaly sometimes) and when he fails to do so simply lucks out somehow. Or you could be someone with high INT and PER, as some post-apocalyptic version of Nikola Tesla helping or abusing others with your high intelligence keen mind. Or someone with high STR and END, a guy with scares anyone who dares to stand in his way, a terrifying monster like man who uses chems as if they're juice. A wasteland doctor who helps communities or works with drug dealers, some badass wasteland Ranger who shots a mutant in the eye, saves the town then sleeps spends his earnings with some h**kers  Sadly in Fallout 4 none of it possible: a voiced acted character with very restrictive background kills all possibilites. New dialog system simply ignores your skills and for that you simply can't RP your character during dialogs.  Companions are much better this time however due to their A.I they simply take away the fun and ambiance from exploration, which is the best offering of Fallout 4.  Number of decent side quests are very few, radiant quests are everywhere and they're forced on you most of the time.  Anytime you return to your settlement some pointless radiant quest is given and they sometimes sends you to other side of the map for no apperant reason: when player randomly finds a new locations during exploration it feels rewarding however when they become quest markers for simple ""kill everyone"" mission suddenly they don't lose that: because you know the name of the this place and there you'll kill raiders or ghouls. Radiant quests and companion A.I simply hurts the exploration.  This game lacks anything original or innovative.What Fallout 4 offers mostly repetative things like settlement building or radiant quests but does not offers many well written, well designed quests that series are known for. It's a good game however it offers less of what previous games did and their places gives uses hollow things like a mediocre building mechanic, a horrible repetive radiant quests.  FPS is better, Power Armors fun, enemies and combat are varied yes however most sad thing is F4 simply lacks the criticising approach to the nationalistic and consumer centric culture of the old world that older games had: in Fallout there was always this the stark contradiction between the actual wasteland and posters that show the old world as world of family values and freedom. In truth before the reckoning humanity had fallen as low is it could, people were greedy, ignorant and vile. In contrast F4 is idealizing the old world during the prologue, wee see the old world as it is shown in the posters.  If Fallout 4 lacks the role-playing and lacks the intelligent writing and lacks the theme, then why it's called  Fallout?… Expand "

Despite the attempt at pathos, there's ... none. There's nothing. 'I'M READY. BECAUSE WAR... WAR NEVER CHANGES.'  It sums up the game, but not in a good way. It's unintentionally a great way of driving home that you in fact have no agency as a player when it comes to the story, at least. Is this not how ""your"" character would react? Well, you don't actually have a character. You customize your appearance, but in no meaningful way are you actually making a character. You're Joe Soldier or Jane Lawyer. The people defending this - I don't know. Part of it's blind fanboyism, some of it's this weird drive to maintain the letters 'RPG' because the original Fallout games have them, and I strongly suspect some of it's ignorance from never having played an actual CRPG - just iterations of The Bethesda Game and maybe some JRPGs.  A lot of people defend it on the basis that the combat is better. But ""better"" in no way means ""good"". Despite positioning itself as a shooter, Fallout 4 fails as thoroughly as an FPS as it does as an RPG. The combat is simplistic, the weapon balance is a joke, the much-touted mod system is largely just upgrades to damage and scope range and is used to justify a tiny number of base weapons, and one of the only pair of RPG mechanics Fallout 4 retains makes it all the more annoying - enemies are bullet sponges, soaking up dozens of .308 or .50 bullets to go down if they spot you and remove the stealthed damage bonus.  It's the summer blockbuster of games. It's formulaic, it's flashy, and it's enormously dumb. If you turn your brain off, it can be fun - until the threads start to unravel, until the endless inconsistencies of the world become impossible to ignore, until the tedium of combat mounts, etc, etc, etc.  It's a game that's going to be utterly forgotten. Almost 20 years later, people still talk about Fallout.  Nobody's going to talk about Fallout 4.  Not in a positive way, and not even in a negative way.

Upon leaving the vault and entering the wasteland, it feels like every other Fallout title.  You can't wait to explore unique locations, find stronger weapons, get your first suit of power armor; ultimately, finish quests with the best possible outcome.  Whether your character is good, evil, or neutral- your choices effect what kind of ending you get.  My first impressions of Fallout 4 were pretty good.  Graphics were improved, the main story was interesting, side quests reaped good rewards, gameplay was smooth (aside from a few bugs).  I thought the settlements provided a nice break from questing and exploring.  There was only 2 things that really bothered me.  (1)The new perk/stat/skill allocation system being one of them.  I felt like I had way less control over the development of my character.  (2)Dialog options.  With only having 4 dialog options, it severely limited the role playing aspect of the game.  Obviously, this change was implemented for console gamers and/or casual players with a short attention spans.  As with all my first playthroughs- no guides, no forums, no spoilers.  Since I did not read or discuss Fallout 4, I remained blissfully ignorant throughout most of the game.  I started getting a little nervous after doing 20+ quests for each of the factions.  I found myself asking, ""Um, when is this quest-line going to end?... this is getting repetitive"".  Shortly after, I realized these must be repeatable quests and I'm just wasting my time.  I decided to continue the main quest and explore more.  The progression of the main quest was a bit anti-climatic and predictable.  Suddenly, every location seemed generic and heavily repeated.  I had 20+ settlements and they constantly asked for help.  Building became boring the second I learned how limited and inconsequential it was.  After a while, I dreaded finding new settlements.  It kept getting easier and easier.  I periodically upped the difficult level until I was maxed out on survival by level 50.  The amount of HP and armor enemies had made my weapon and armor selection extremely limited.  Combat remained easy, but it became a chore.  Around this time, I didn't need anything.  Caps, stimpaks, ammo, armor, weapons, ect. were all a ""non-issue.""  I was carting junk for my pointless settlements, that's about it.  The final push was painful.  After finding as many locations and completing as many quests that I could, it was time to finally beat the game.  Around level 80, I saved before I became enemies with anyone significant so I could reload in order to explore other ""possibilities.""  There was a cut-scene.  Then there was confusion.  I couldn't understand.  I literally had to Google to make sure what I saw was the actual ending.  Then I reloaded and beat it 2 other ways.  I sat in awe as I realized how inconsequential every decision I made was.  All those speech checks, settlements, and side-quests.  I could have ignored 95% of the content and would have gotten the same vague, asinine ending.  I picked up the few achievements I missed; closed the game and said good-bye for good.  I've played every Fallout (besides Fallout Tactics) and this is the first one to have zero point zero replayability.  I agree with the common consensus that it's not bad game, but it's not a great game either.  As many have stated, it's less immersive and lacks the ""RP"" in ""RPG"".  That's why I give it a 5/10 for it's complete mediocrity.  For fans of Fallout 1 & 2, I recommend you check out Wasteland 2; if you haven't already.  I enjoyed Wasteland 2 more than Fallout 4, which might sound crazy to some.  Honestly, I wish Bethesda would bring Brian Fargo back to the Fallout Series.  Pipe dream, really.

In Fallout 4, there seem to be lots of these things, and some of them are very tough. In general, it feels like enemies are tougher to take down than they should be with guns. If I shoot a gangster in the head four or five times, I feel like I should be done with them. Not in this game.

I'll also say that when Fallout 4 is good it's very good but I honestly can't give the game as a whole more than half marks because there are so many problems with it.  1. The settlement stuff is crap. I'm a lone wanderer, not a homesteader. Don't bother me with having to baby a bunch of strangers everywhere I go. 2. The new dialogue system is really awful. There's usually one choice. If you pick something else the options re-appear until you pick the 'right' choice to make the game progress the way it was going to anyway. 3. The leveling system is a huge step backward, and is designed in such a way as to make breaking the game much easier. For example I used to have to wait until I was very far into the game to take 'Ninja' in previous Fallout games. Now I can take it on level 1. Talking of which... 4. Giving the player access to power armour on level 1 and setting up a confrontation with a deathclaw almost immediately in a game like Fallout is such a blunder from a pacing and progression point of view  that it boggles my mind. 5. The crafting system seems tacked on and feels very awkward. It seems that they've used arbitrary crafting and level checks to balance an otherwise broken game. 6. The game becomes more and more tedious and samey as you progress. You're often sent back to the same locations two or three times to do different quests, and while some of the quests are interesting, the vast majority are 'go there and kill everything that moves'. 7. There is no hardcore mode. Survival mode just means you have to pump more bullets into each enemy and it takes longer for you to heal, but as the leveling system is broken it won't take long before you're flush with ammo and not worrying about healing much anyway.  In short Fallout 4 is a decent but not great game with a lot of issues. It's really not progressed much at all in the 4 or so years since New Vegas (which I'd argue is the far superior game in almost every respect). It's much more of an FPS and less of an RPG than the previous games, which will please some (mostly players new to the franchise) and annoy others (a lot of people who love the previous Fallout games).  My advice is this: If you love the previous Fallout games then wait until Fallout 4 is discounted on Steam. It's worth $30 or so imo.  I'm sure there will be more Fallout games in the future, but this latest has set a few precedents that don't bode well for upcoming Fallout games, so I think it'd be great if they handed the next one to Obsidian, who in my opinion did most things right with New Vegas. That's unlikely to happen though, so I'm not really looking forward to Fallout 5.… Expand "

I would like to beginOkay, I'm going to make this relatively short and sweet and (hopefully) include all the necessary details you would be concerned about when considering buying this game.  First of all, I have played every Bethesda game since Oblivion including New Vegas and many a time I've loved the Fallout franchise more than Elder Scrolls! So this is also coming from a fanboy.  I would like to begin by establishing a seemingly contradictory point and then elaborate slightly on it; Fallout 4 feels too different, and too familiar, and I mean those in a negative light.  Let put some useful information in point form for easy reading:  -The dialogue system may be more dynamic in the sense that you can view it in 3rd or 1st person, or walk away when you please(which is finicky in and of itself) but the depth is completely stripped away. New dialogue options based on skills like Medicine or Science? Nope. Player choice? I don't think so. Even if you say no you can always return and say yes. There's no lasting impact in the dialogue and it doesn't feel right.  -The world is smaller, yes. I don't much mind small worlds as long as sufficient detail has been placed in them and they're dense with activities to do. Unfortunately it just isn't the case. One of the first towns you're in, Concord, has almost all its doors barred. Why? No idea. Many times it feels like it's packed with a lot but with some insight and careful inspection it isn't. Bethesda have slightly abused quest generation to make the game go on ""indefinitely"". Maybe it would work if you didn't have to go to the same building 5 times and clear out the same raiders 5 times to retrieve an item in a chest for a particular quest which was the same chest that held all other 4 items. Wow.  -Skills? Nope. They're gone. Remember Bartering and Sneak and Lockpicking and Science and Repair? Gone. Everything is now a perk. You level up, you get a perk and that is it. The perks fall under the categories of S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes. So you want a perk that would allow you to carry more? That would be under Strength. If you don't have enough points assigned to Strength, the perk will be locked until you assign some points. It's not terribly, but I miss the Fallout 3 and New Vegas systems. This feels like it was made for a dumber crowd.  -Something that has bugged me almost more than everything else is the feeling of being in the post apocalyptic wasteland. It's supposed to feel like a survival game. Scavenging, looting and getting by, hoping to not get jumped by a passing group of raiders or super mutants. This doesn't feel like that. I have way too many Stimpaks (they heal you) and Radaways (they remove radiation poisoning). And grenades and ammo are supplied one metric ton at a time. Raiders seem to have infinite molotovs or grenades as they constantly spam them until you're nothing but an ash pile. -The radio. You remember those songs from Fallout 3? HERE THEY ARE AGAIN. Maybe 2 or 3 new songs added to the collection. Hope you're not sick of them from, you know, playing hundreds of hours of Fallout 3 or anything. Radio DJ is funny at first, then obnoxious... until you just put the radio off.  ALRIGHT  I've had my negative rant but let me point out some positive points.  +Power Armor is what it always should've been. It's like you're in a badass mech.  +Modifying weapons is excellent.  +Modifying armour is also great, but no where as good as weapon modification. Limited.  +Settlement construction is nice. That's it. Finicky; feels tacked on. Feels like it was put in for people to spend most of their time doing it instead of questing but it's honestly just ok.  +Gunplay is great. Feels natural and visceral at its greatest.  All in all. Fallout 4 is a good game. But not a good Fallout by any standard.  Welcome to FarCry: Wasteland Edition… Expand "

No. Sure, the story makes no sense, there isn't too much variety of enemies or guns, has a terrible dialogue system and, I'm not sarcastic or exaggerating here, it's literally just Skyrim with guns, but saying that the game has no redeeming qualities is just wrong. Bethesda tried to emulate the things which made Fallout: New Vegas good, and where they failed they failed miserably, but the things they did right they did right. The companions are well made and have very colourful personalities, and even an option to romance some of them was added, even if it's as laughably bad as in most games. There are a lot of collectibles all throughout the Commonwealth, which are very nice mini-rewards after clearing dungeons. The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an RPG, even if it gets tedious after a while. When it comes to combat, it's without a doubt the most fun game in the series, even if I don't like the fact that V.A.T.S. now slows time instead of stopping it. Now for the bad stuff.  The ""4 options, no more, no less"" dialogue system is pointless and shouldn't have been added at all, since it only gives more work to the writers and is terrible for the players. The story makes absolutely no sense and effectively limits your roleplaying abilities. (spoiler) The four factions you can choose are there solely because Bethesda noticed the popularity of the 4-faction system in NV and they are executed terribly. (/spoiler) Voiced protagonist, while seen as devil incarnate by many, I personally didn't mind. There were a few moments when the tone of the actor's voice wasn't like what I thought it would be, but not too many. Almost all quests are ""Speak with X/Collect Y/Kill Z"" with some twist (e.g. ""Find a robot BUT the robot makes beer) that the writers thought would make the quest good on its own. Some would say ""Well, if the story, dialogues and quests are the only problems, while all the fun action stuff is good, then what's so wrong?"". That is precisely what's wrong. This game is still Fallout - a series where the story, factions and quests are a core of the game. Yet it seems Bethesda thought the game they're making is an Elder Scrolls game in a different setting. If the game was from a series other than Fallout, it could easily have a higher rating. But since it is a Fallout game, there are some expectations about the quality of the game's story, narrative, lore and dialogues - none of which were fulfilled by Fallout 4.… Expand "

Rather it would have been if I hadn’t sunk a relatively large amount of time in clinging to the hope it would get better.  I think everyone, especially fans of the earlier games, will be extremely disappointed in Fallout 4. Most of the elements that made Fallout unique have either been stripped out, dumbed down, or completely removed. In exchange we now have a moderately interesting but mostly frustrating to use village simulator. That's right, you can now construct mini towns for completely lifeless and uninteresting AI! It seems as though the development time spent on this particular feature was sorely needed elsewhere. Gun customization is a nice touch but generally boils down to adding a few different preset mods to a limited number of base weapons and armor.  One of the other new features is the conversation system. I think there are implementations of it that could work but generally it just feels wrong in the context of Fallout. Additionally, as other users have reported many choices seem to lead to the same outcome. Being a jerk, sometimes even outright refusing options will have the same result as choices like “Let’s do it!”. Furthering the feeling of choices not making a difference, there are other well discussed issues such as invincible NPCs and commonly being denied the ability to do things that you could in past games.  Combat feels slightly improved compared to past Bethesda entries in the Fallout series but overall doesn’t do any one thing particularly well. There’s no concept of cover and gun play generally involves pointing and clicking while you strafe. That wouldn’t be the worst thing ever if shooting felt as tight as something like Counter-Strike. Unfortunately, the default settings like mouse acceleration, smoothing, and other issues like extreme frame dips make your standard point and click with a mouse much less satisfying. Sneaking is present but extremely basic. It certainly won’t make you feel like Venom in MGSV. VATS is unique but essentially only exists as a brief moment of auto-aim that provides relief for the otherwise sub-par shooting experience.  Another disappointing area but not totally unexpected is Fallout 4’s graphics. I don’t believe they’re quite as terrible as some of the 0/10s would have you believe but they definitely aren’t what you would expect out of a “AAA” title. I would suggest making judgement on this area yourself through YouTube videos, screenshots, etc.  I won’t touch too much on the story because it can largely be affect by things like exploration, side questions, and other factors. For the most part, if you’re expecting something along the lines of The Witcher you will likely be disappointed.  Finally, In typical Bethesda fashion the game suffers from a range of issues including crashing to desktop, models randomly disappearing, getting stuck after using terminals, and only being able to hear NPCs talk when you are facing 180 degrees away from them. Browsing online it’s clear I’m not the only experiencing these issues. Rather I seem to among the more fortunate who haven’t run into anything game breaking yet. Some people don’t think these bugs should be factored into the score because they will be fixed eventually. However, these bugs did affect my overall enjoyment of the game in more than a marginal way.  Overall Fallout 4 was a mostly mediocre experience that probably would have been great as a $40 game not associated with the Fallout franchise.

What do you expect from a Fallout game?There is no opinions (except the factions part ) in this review, i will simply tell you what is missing or was ""dumbed down"" aka streamlined since Fallout 3 or NV.  Let me preface this by saying that this game was and is the most expensive game ever sold on the Brazilian section of Steam, so if i seem to be angry it is because indeed i am.  What do you expect from a Fallout game? -Challenge -Freedom -Risk/reward type deals -backstabbing,stealing,killing annoying npcs -multiple endings -interesting factions  Is any of that in the game? Well, even on very hard the enemies are easy, the AI is a throwback to 1998 and will do the absolute worst shooting you ever saw in a game, paradoxally will grenade your candy bottom from 2 miles away with pinpoint precision. There is no alternative way to complete any quest, what you are ordered to do you do and that's that, so forget about speech, sneak, science or any other such way you are able to employ in previous Fallout games, those simply do not exist anymore.  Freedom comes in the form of free roaming but the wasteland, that remains, but any feeling of accomplishment is taken away by the fact that minutes into the game, if you go where the game wants you too you will be given power armor by people who do not know you, who just watched you kill raiders because reasons and apparently have no use for power armor themselves, if you go off the rails prepare to be carrying 50 pipeguns which are the ugliest guns ever in any Fallout game, and one or two other guns, maybe a few melee which by the way, now require you to press another button to perform a power attack. Since i estabilished that there is no freedom on side-quests, ""what about the main quest?"" you may wonder, well, there is no freedom at all, you do what you are told and you do it in this specific way and that's it.  With the removal of speech options and skills altogether it becomes apparent that there is no risk reward anymore, any ""build"" will max everything and the only hindrance you're going to find are locks with higher levels in the early game, you lose nothing by choosing a particular play style, but win nothing, after 200 hundred years frozen, not knowing jack about **** i was about to be a master engineer, operate high tech weaponry, understand the concept of bottle caps as money, granted these are all reocurring tropes in the Fallout universe, but i expected more from this, they could've easily made it so one of the vault technicians wandered outside and came back, so he/she/it tells you what's up or leaves personal logs on any of the many useless terminals you're bound to find inside the vault.  Most NPCS in towns and settlements are unkilable just like children, most of them have no personality and no depth, they serve no purpose other than spew expository lines at random to each other, a lot of them feel like that guy from Whiterun ""do you get to the cloud district very often?"" except in this one you cannot kill them, and if you do there's no consequences to it. Remember there is no Karma system. You cannot backstab you cannot double cross you cannot keep nothing to yourself, you either do the quest like a good boy or skip it, there is no other way.  There's no multiple ending in the scope or depth that New Vegas had[FACT], you do this evil thing or this good thing and that's that[FACT]. See for yourself it's abolutely anti-climatic.{OPINION]  The factions are bland, black and white good guy/bad guy mush, no depth no passion, you meet them for 5 minutes and they wanna make you their leaders, the **** from the brotherhood who despised the common rabble are few and far between and the good old days where the brotherhood did not claim to be good or evil, just in the business of acquiring tech are long gone.

Bethesda has stripped down the game elements their core fans want, those being dynamic, player-driven stories, awesome quests, beautiful game worlds, and character development/progression.

Such was the utter stupidity of the plot that I felt compelled to exterminate every one of these imbeciles to stop their idiocy from infecting the rest of the wasteland. Not that the people in the wasteland were any better but they've been exposed to high levels of radiation so their brain damage is understandable. Oh and I had to download a mod in order to kill almost anything not a raider or a ghoul in this damn game.  Despite the gross dumbification that has occurred in the Elder Scrolls series, this game actually made me appreciate Skyrim for the factions and guilds that you can join. Believe it or not in that game you can actually *drumroll* roleplay a **** character!  This game is comprised of two things - shoot and loot.  Don't get me wrong I quite like running around in the GITS suit shooting stuff with an M14 or sneaking around stabbing raiders but you quickly realise that it's all for nothing. Just a big sandbox full of things to shoot but nothing to actually invest you in the world. Bethesda appears more interested in creating gimmicky theme parks than they do a realistic living breathing world.  The BoS are you're stereotypical good guys now, unlike New Vegas where they were struggling with the growing realization of themselves becoming totally redundant, overshadowed by the NCR. In this game they have access to a massive airship, untold numbers of vertibirds, power armour suits and soldiers - I thought these guys were supposed to be a close knit group of secretive cultists who lived in bunkers?  Even with mods that show you what your character is going to say the dialogue is still atrocious. Upon meeting the BoS and completing the mandatory ""go there kill everything"" mission (get used to them!) I was asked if I wanted to join them. The guy said he expected me to follow their tenants - I asked them what they were and it was ""honesty and respect"" - really... is that it!?

And out of nowhere Fallout showed its other, technically broken face. In those areas the game performance is drastically worsening. Obviously, those areas contain a high amount of object and detail, but a drecrease of FPS like 50% and worse with additional stuttering, no matter what I tweak via driver or ini files, is just not acceptable at all. And I have to mention that even when playing in the outskirts of the map now, the performance keeps behaving nervous with stutterings in between. To be fair: it helps to reduce shadow distance to the lowest setting, but this heavily affects the graphical fidelity. VERDICT: gameplay wise a ton of quality entertainment, unfortunately packed with severe technical issues. From my point of view Fallout 4 needs quick repairs.… Expand "

No more weapon/armor repairs, no more ammo crafting, no more individual skills, no more of anything that you'd think think would be in a post-apocalyptic RPG. It's so apparently obvious this game was built around attracting the non-Fallout player. The dialogue wheel was one of the most pointless additions to make, 3/4 choices lead to the same conversation point every single time anyways. So much for immersing yourself whenever your character has forced voice acting.  The word ""forced"" also explains the story. While I've only finished the game once with a certain faction so far, I've felt forced through every main quest the whole time. You are forced (literally, by the voice acting) to sound incredibly distraught and desperate about your missing son. Sorry, but using the angle of ""your son"" to suddenly thrust the player into caring about a character they'd known for all of 5 minutes is just poor story-telling in my opinion.  Lastly, the game crashes once every two hours for me, at the minimum. I've had crashes from: opening Pip-boy immediately after fast traveling. Immediately crashing when loading the external world. Two loading screens that never finished. I've had bugs where I couldn't look vertically after using VATS, a couple getting stuck in terrain, and a couple involving NPCs initiating dialogue from far away. Thankfully I quicksave every couple minutes now.  Overall, the only reason I'm really continuing the game is because it is still fun IF you pretend that it isn't a Fallout 3 / NV sequel.

Far Cry 3 was also hundreds and Far Cry 4 ditto.  Fallout 4? 6 Hours and it's not doing it for me.  First of all, given the story, the world doesn't feel or look right or really make sense in my mind.  It's feels tiny, you travel from one ""location"" or town(?) to the next by basically taking about 100 steps in any direction and boom! You're in a new location.  Open World? Pretty loose use of the term in my opinion.  By comparison Skyrim ""felt"" immense. Far Cry 3 and 4 felt huge. There were caves and waterfalls and hidden paths and nooks and cranies scattered all over the place, but each one felt quite a ways from the other. Miles it felt like. In Fallout 4 it seems like everything is crammed together. There's no sense of vast nuclear devastation, long straight roads into the distance with no one around.  Granted, I haven't seen much or played much but then, I almost don't really want to.  2nd, the World doesn't feel right given the story of this being 200 years after the blast. You're telling me 200 years in, not a single tree has grown back?  Bugs have mutated to dog size in just 200 years? Really? Even mutant ones?  And yet, buildings and stuff is still standing 200 years in?  Sorry, it's all feeling wrong. It all looks wrong.  Graphics wise, as others have said, it basically feels like a repurposed Skyrim, not that this is bad, but hey, it's like 4 or 5 years later now and granted it's a different environment (one has trees and the other should but doesn't), but FarCry 4 makes this game look really bad by comparison.

lakired,"Nov 13, 2015",2," For those whose 'Fallout' experience began with Bethesda's resumption of the franchise (III), expectations of what it is to earn the 'Fallout' title will differ grandly from those of us old folk who first cut their teeth on the brilliant and charming wit of the originals.

For us, Fallout III was a rather lackluster mimic of its titular predecessors, lacking the charisma and depth that defined the previous games. Viewed in a vacuum, however--other than the absurd and baffling end scene--it was still a remarkably entertaining game. Yet by adopting the Fallout moniker, Bethesda took on the burden of comparison, and cannot fairly be excused from it. As such, I will begin by saying that Fallout IV is unique in its ability to bring both fans of the original and the new version together in decrying its deviations from what made the franchise so beloved.  Many critics have maligned the title as no longer being housed within the 'RPG' genre. While this isn't in itself strictly true, it is accurate to say that it is now a 'predetermined' RPG, which is to say, you do play a role, but it is one that is decided for you. In a vacuum, this is not necessarily a bad feature. Countless games have had profound success telling linear stories. However, it is simply not what 'Fallout' has ever been at its heart. Do you want to be a hardened scavenger, killing for caps? A silver-tongued rogue manipulating others to their own gain? A stoic hero of 'civilized' society mercilessly ridding the wasteland of mutant scum? Or maybe you've been itching to play a concerned (and occasionally snarky) parent? I hope it's the latter, because that's your only option in Fallout IV.  In conjunction with this, Bethesda chose to strip down the character customization process. While it may be somewhat a matter of preference, I think overall it was a step back. In its previous incarnations, your SPECIAL stats really defined you as a character, and perks were always interesting and unique. The new system feels watered down and generic in comparison.  While some may have been uneasy or antagonistic about the inclusion of the entirely new 'settlement construction' aspect, I personally was full ready to embrace it. While it may be new territory for the game, I'm not averse to innovation if it supplements and adds to the rest of the game. That said, the implementation of this feature was clunky, to be as polite as possible. I do have hope however that these infant stumblings will reap a fuller reward in future expansions.  Graphically, Fallout IV is utilizing the same damn engine that's now near a decade old, while somehow not managing to escape any of the sins of those who've come before it. Even more baffling, despite leaning on older tech, its system demands are not even close to reasonable. If we can't get next-gen graphics, couldn't we at least have gotten better clipping and frame rate?  As I mentioned before, viewed through the lens of expectation, Fallout III was a disappointment. However, removed from those expectations, it was still an exceptional game that stood on its own merits. So does Fallout IV do the same?  As it shifts from an RPG focus to more of an Action-FPS, it does so with at least some grace in that its combat system is fluid and tense. The change to VATS is more aligned with the type of game Bethesda has produced. Oh, and there's sprinting! Finally!  The addition of an in-depth crafting system may seem rather ho-hum given its ubiquity in the current gaming environment, however it really does add to the gritty environment of a scavenged wasteland. With that in mind, its own system is somewhat undermined by the ease of access to high-caliber weaponry and armor from the get-go. Rather than painfully scrounging the desert wasteland for materials to patch together a unique and haphazard arsenal, you'll be stumbling upon miniguns and powersuits so fast that the pipe-pistol and leather duster you found are just more junk to be scrapped and sold, rather than a meaningful and exciting progression.  While the voice-acting is solid (as is the sound quality in general), the story line--highlighted by clumsy dialogue radial 'options'--is lackluster at best. What's even more damning about this design decision is that it severely impairs the ability of modders to 'save' the game from its own awful and uninspired writing. Quests are soulless and forgettable. The world map is beautiful, but too small to not have greater interactivity (why so few encounters, and so many boarded up filler buildings?).  All said, even ignoring the long shadow cast by its progenitors, this is not a game that offers enough to justify its price tag. While even Bethesda couldn't ruin its cash-cow to the point of unplayability (when is roaming the wasteland blasting holes in raider skulls not fun?), Fallout: New Vegas with a slew of community mods is still a far better game. So if you're feeling the itch, pull out an old save file from that instead.… Expand "

Better than all previous bethesda games. -The potential. I think mods can do a lot to save this game. I'm just glad they didn't change their view on modding. -Exploration is pretty good. The world is huge, lots going on. Very well done ruined city, tons of buildings to explore. Can't imagine how much time was put into creating this world. -Crafting is good. I don't like how every single item can be used. A pack of cigarettes gives the same amount of cloth as an area rug... but hey, it doesn't have to be perfect. Crafting is powerful, and fun. -Power armor is cool. I really enjoy it, even if i feel a bit OP. Ok way OP. But cranking the difficulty changes that.  What I don't like, too many thing to list, here are the top ones: -Removal of old features like weapon repairs and skill system. -Level progress is totally consistent throughout gameplay. It takes the same amount of effort to go from level 1 to level 2 as it takes to go from level 44 to level 45. WTF, thats not normal for rpgs. -Settlements are annoying, they break immersion, and make fast travel required. The feature feels unfinished, and unrewarding. It could be so much more than it is. I plan to make a mod to improve this. -The wasteland doesn't feel desperate. People seems to be doing just fine, like nukes never destroyed the earth. The environment says otherwise, but it fails to maintain the feeling in some areas as well. -Dialogue is a total joke, might as well not give the player a choice in conversation at all. -Not very immersive. But i think mods can fix this. All bethesda games need mods for total immersion, but fallout 4 is far worse than usual. -Enemies can take a lot of bullets, have way too much health. I'm sure this will be addressed by mods eventually.  Why did bethesda think changing all this stuff was going to be a good thing? They have such a huge following now, they can release anything and make tons of money from the preorders alone, and they did. They clearly had a working formula for good games, beloved games.

In FO4 it always comes down to the same thing: eplore a place, kill everything in there, get a reward.  On top of that there is a settlement building aspect included in the game, use of which is required to finish the main quest. This system has a terrible interface (on PC). It is literally a nightmare to control. The hearthfire DLC for Skyrim did this aspect way better, there at least you could ""drag and drop"" items.  One defendable aspect is the implementation of the power armor. Combat is OK but becomes repetitive due to lack of peaceful/diplomatic options.

I wish there were options to really take charge as a leader, make great alliances etc.  Skills are completely gone. Perks take too long to gain. There are too many, and the leveling is too slow. I reached level 40 and maybe have 20-25% of all of the perks. The perks have great bonuses, but what's the point if you are too limited while playing. It leaves a lot to be desired while playing the game.  No karma system! No moral system. Goes for reputation and dialogue. It ruins both. The only kind of 'karma' in the game is whether you get your companion to 'like or dislike' a certain action. This is pretty meaningless.  There's just not enough variation. Legendary items are garbage mainly, you get very crappy bonuses most of the time. And that's all it is. Just simple little bonuses rather than huge upgrades. There are maybe 10 different 'unique guns' and the rest are all just variations of them. Same goes for armor, you have 5 armor sets. Leather, raider, metal, combat, synth. Definitely not enough rare gear in the game. Modding takes too long for some guns (meaning close to endgame to unlock) but it is a great concept.  The map is pretty small. The content is pretty limited. The game doesn't feel large. Most of the cities are just copies of each other. In most of the cities, there is nothing to explore. You go around fighting 3 different groups. That's it. Raiders/Gunners, Super mutants, Ghouls. And some wild animals away from the cities. It gets extremely boring and repetitive. If you liked exploring and looting in the old fallout games, Fallout 4 ruined this aspect.  There aren't enough groups in the game. You have 4 major groups to play with and to side for. They are all very bland and only really tie in with the main story (other than one group which has a long storyline to it). These groups have no 'deeper' meaning. They just feel empty and like lost potential.  The game's scale is way too small. I only experienced one actual battle, and then one endgame battle. These were pathetic and did not have nearly enough groups/npc's involved.  The graphics could be better, although I am not one to care for graphics. Colors are great and perky. However facial animations are horrendous at times and feel extremely dated. Many times, the motion does not match the power of the dialogue.  Power armor is great, but it's just too big and ruins the FOV in first and third person. I barley played with it for this reason. Also I feel that the gap between power armor and regular armor is way too huge. You should be able to play the game without power armor (you can but some points in the game it would be extremely difficult).  Game is also not that stable with many reports of issues in game. I experienced this myself where my game constantly crashes to desktop at Sanctuary whenever I try to scrap, activate, or fight enemies. No idea why, but this is a major issue. You'd think that this issues should be taken care of in testing.  Settlements are fun, but also not as deep as they could be.. hence why you are proposed to build many (quantity > quality). They aren't as beneficial as they could be. They are just little time wasters to get your creative aspect going. Something I feel Bethesda added last minute just to bandwagon.  All in all, the game is decent. It's fun to play and can be addicting. But it just feels rushed. There isn't enough content that I expected. The content that's there i's too shallow in a lot of aspects. The dialogue changes are straight up horrible. The game is disappointing. The main story is the only thing that this game has going for it. It's appealing and interesting. But again, there are times where there is much left to be desired, and times where you wish there were more options and control.… Expand "

The game has a great setting and design, good gameplay and shooting mechanics and a pretty solid story, but it's just not quite ""Fallout"" enough, for me anyway. To me fallout was never really about the shooting or gameplay but more about the conversations and the choices i made, It had interesting side missions that were cool and memorable, but Fallout 4 doesnt really have any of this.  First off the conversations are dumbed down, a lot, and i dont mean the vague choice you have i mean the outcome, in fallout 3 your conversations could go a number of ways, you could end them with shooting the persons head off, or bribing them, or using your science skills to gain more info, there was so much more depth to them which is why im very disappointed in fallout 4's system, usually you always end up with the same result no matter what you pick, that or you either end up in a firefight or you end up not in a fire fight.  One of the faults for this the fact you dont have a science skill anymore, or explosive, or anything like that, now all you have are perks which all have different effect but none on the conversation, there's no situation where you use your skills to disarm a bomb, now you can just do it. This really limits the ""RPG"" aspect of the game seeing as you can pretty much do anything no matter how you play your character, if i want to be a smooth talking charisma based character i still have to be able to fight my way through a horde of enemies, there's no more talking my way out of a situation now it's shoot first ask questions later which really bummed me out seeing as that's usually how i like playing these games.  Apart from all that another flaw i found, and maybe this is just me, but i didn't think there were many memorable locations, sure the main story takes you to cool locations but besides that none really come to mind, it also doesnt help that the vaults in the game you can visit are pretty lackluster, again none as memorable as ""Gary"" or the vault from 3 where you hallucinate, which again is a massive disappointment. maybe their saving the best for DLC but if that's the case it's even more depressing.  Also after putting over 100 hours into the game i kinda feel like ive done everything i want to, the rest are just boring side missions that say ""hey go here and kill these guys and ill give you some caps"", which gets pretty repetitive.  A great feature that i do keep going back to is the settlement builder, it's very fun and engrossing to build up a settlement from the ground up and make your own cool and unique locations in the map, but it's very limited if you don't use mods, which takes me to my next point.  Mods, possible the best feature in any Bethesda game, the modding community already has a ton of mods available that are great, i spend a lot of my time just browsing the nexus forum and picking out mods that i think are cool, this game will have a much longer timespan thanks to mods, just looks at Skyrim still going strong because of mods.  All in all Fallout was my most anticipated game of the year and though it has satisfied me as a game, it has also become one the most disappointing games for me, sure i can't blame bethesda for not making the perfect game that i imagined it would be but to me fallout just seems like it saw other game and tried to copy them and in doing so it lost the heart of a fallout game.  That's what i'll leave this with, Fallout 4 is a good game but it's lacking the heart of a fallout game which could have made it great… Expand "

No more joys of exploring vast underground subway stations filled with ghouls, no more exploring interesting, sometimes downright sinister vaults ; FO4 has several vaults but they all are smaller and uninteresting compared to FO3. Some shills from bethesda will always claim that when indoors and outdoors are combined, FO4 is bigger than FO3.  But hey, most of the indoor area is smaller, too, no more sense of wonder, no more vast world out there for you to explore, everything is smaller and packed in a small area.  You basically goes from street to street where endlessly respawning same 'ol radiers, gunners, mutants in a very familiar area since you've been there more than 40 times!  Forced, overexaggerated presence of settlement This time around building settlement takes a rather big part of fallout gameplay.  They say it's completely optional but I can't help but feeling that good chunks of explorable area got reduced or omitted to give ways to this settlement management.  Really bad optimization FO4 apparently focuses heavily on first person shooting this time around.  Shooting foes became much more smooth, and feels and handles a lot like any other modern shooters on the market. One thing bestheda forgot to realize in the game is that you need a smooth framerate for smooth first person shooting experience.  In this regard, FO4 pc version surely dropped the ball.  Introduction of nvidia only features like godrays, which btw is the main cause of stuttering and FPS drops even on very beefy machines.  Shadow bugs in the city area that can knock out FPS like nobody's business.  Pay a visit to corvega assembly plant, and you'll know what it is like to play a FPS with 13~20 FPS.  One thing you should know is that bestheda along with microsoft, intel HD, nvidia optimus seems to cut off their support for full screen mode on windows 8.1.  Basically if you're using a laptop with windwos 8.1 + intel HD graphic card + nvidia optimus card especially GT800M and GT900M series, you can never run the game in full screen and forced to play only on borderless window mode, which introduces another 10 to 15 FPS drop.  There is no way to really tell which companies are really responsible or which combination of them are resopnsible, but if there is one thing clear, MS is refusing to update windows 8.1 denying basic functionality like able to play the game in full screen mode for the aforementioned setup.  Intel driver department has admitted that this is an issue with the driver, yet couldn't, maybe don't want to come up with the solution for about 2 years now, since dragon age inquisition has the same problem reported by countless users on EA forum, intel forum, nvidia forum alike.… Expand "

El juego está simplificado a su mínima expresión en prácticamente todos los aspectos. Uno de los principales fallos está en la opción de diálogo, y es que las respuestas posibles están simplificadas hasta tal punto que resultan absurdas, siendo posibles respuestas tan superficiales como ""Sarcasmo"", ""Si"", ""No""... por no hablar de que la rama carismática no sirve prácticamente para nada. En muy pocas ocasiones ha cambiado realmente el rumbo de una conversación tener a nivel máximo esta característica.  La facilidad para conseguir balas, para disparar, la cantidad de enemigos que habitan supuestamente un yermo muerto, han convertido a un juego de supervivencia en un juego más de disparos.  Los asentamientos no me parece una mala idea del todo, pero no está bien pensada, ya que nuevamente rompe el sentido de supervivencia. La exploración en busca de cosas interesante pasa a ser una recolección de basura de todo lo que encuentres para poder hacer una nueva casa, defensa, generador…  La servoarmadura es sin duda otro caso de buena idea mal llevada a cabo. Técnicamente es una de las herramientas más potentes del yermo, supuestamente escasa y difícil de mantener. En menos de una hora de partida encuentras dos, y de la cantidad de núcleos (necesarios para su funcionamiento) que encuentras a lo largo del camino, podrías mantener, no una, si no dos servoarmaduras operativas al mismo tiempo.  No valoraré la historia como tal, ya que esto entra a juicio de cada uno, pero quiero destacar que el lore (la historia más allá de la principal) sigue estando presente como algo interesante.  Doblaje al Español, el único punto positivo real que tiene el juego. Y es que, no se puede desmerecer el trabajo que lleva detrás un doblaje completo y no solo una traducción.

Uno de los mayores errores de los juegos de esta compañía es el sistema de colisión, siendo que puedes derrotar a los más fieros enemigos con un simple tronco o subiendo a una roca. Por no hablar de caídas brutales de FPS o craseos.  Una decepción en cuanto a rol se refiere lo mires por donde lo mires.

You have to walk around to place stuff. You have to manually assign settlers. You can't check if a settler is already assigned unless you mark them somehow (usually giving assigned settlers specific clothing). Functionally there's almost nothing, it's shallower than Fallout Shelter. -The world is smaller than the last ones, which is made up by well-done locations, which is destroyed by every location being the same linear Raider/Super-mutant/Ghoul-invested area that you clean to get **** loot. -An absurd number of the quests involve going somewhere, killing everything in your way and either killing a specific enemy or taking something. They were added just to mark a location in your map and give you a reason to go there - to the same linear Raider/Super-mutant/Ghoul-invested area that you clean to get **** loot. -The wRPG elements are gone.

I thought Bethesda would learn from FO: New Vegas on how to create a 3D wRPG, but instead they decided that the players are too stupid to have options and create their own path and restrained them to what they wanted.

I am just going to list the good and the bad in the game and that's it. The good: The character creation system was really good. However I must say that it was pointless creating the look of the other character as that character will not matter at all in the game. Crafting system was generally good, at least for the weapons and armor. Combat was improved but it is not nearly as good as other titles which focuses more on combat. VATS was improved although I think that time goes too fast in VATS and it kind of destroys its purpose. Previous VATS  was better, however still a nice feature. The bad: Leveling up. It was just plain horrible, there is no point leveling up anymore since all you get are these perk points. You can't increase your SPECIAL points when you level up! Perks. What the hell, mainstreamed like crazy. Most of these perks are pointless. None of the perks are essential for the game! Combat. Especially the stealth combat does not work. There is absolutely no reason to put on a suppressor on a gun as the enemy will still find you even if you shoot from 200 meters away and have all the necessary perks and everything. Also the hip firing is just horrendous, the targeting grid is so huge that it becomes overly changeling to even get a single hit on the other character. In fact I would suggest everyone to just use melee weapons, they are m,much better. Just run up to the enemy and slash their throats. Dialogue. Lacking very much, I do enjoy the voice acting and everything but dialogue is such a mess that it is pointless to talk to people. Many characters say the exact same **** often it does not matter what the hell you are saying and sarcasm can go either way. Story and quests. Also very lacking, the story was not all that intriguing and felt quite shallow to be honest. But that was still the best part of this section as the quests were absolutely horrendous. What you did was all the same thing, as minuteman you just helped some settlement and as a brotherhood of steel you just went and picked up artifacts and killed every enemy in a location. It was repeated forever, nowhere did it say that, hey stupid progress with the main quest and then the brotherhood of steel quest will also progress. In short quests were awful! Also to note that the story progressed very quickly! Also the ending was basically the same for every faction. The only difference was who was left alive and who roams the commonwealth afterwards as NPCs(boring as hell!). Settlements and crafting for those settlements. The worst feature ever! I tried to make my settlement a safe haven for the settlers. I barricaded them with huge fences just like in some kind of concentration camp, I built them a nice place to live with many beds fitted closely together. I put turrets left and right to shoot any and all attackers. I made a single entrance in the form of a gate and put huge defenses both in front of it and behind it. It was secure as hell and I provided them with all their needs, water, food, security, power, beds. They were happy but they were stupid. When there was an attack these people opened the gate and ran outside so that they could fight when they could just have stayed inside and let the turrets take care of the raiders. So they got killed en mass. Stupid AI, both the NPCs and especially your companions. Graphics. Horrendous graphics and it barely looks better than fallout 3. Loading time. What the hell so many loading times(especially in game!). I have a great PC and it still loads forever even through I have specifically put this game on my Intel SSD drive. Also I have the latest i7 6700K CPU and gtx 980 ti in sli  config and 32 Gigs of DDR4 RAM. It shows one thing, old and bad engine!!!! Radio. The same songs playing over and over again. I just got a headache when listening to it. Bad choice! Bugs everywhere! Some bugs were game breaking. I encountered a bug where I did not take with me danse to the supermutant location and he just appeared there. But he appeared as a hostile despite me not firing a single shot at him.

Before offering my take on what I think are the most important defects, let me offer credit where credit is due by pointing out where Bethesda went right.  Firstly, while many people complain about the graphics quality, I find it to be refreshing, detailed, and overall an implementation beyond my expectations.  Bethesda clearly listened to customer feedback with regard to the dreary green tint in Fallout 3, and noted the improvement in color palette offered by Obsidian in New Vegas.  Secondly, while not perfectly implemented, the base building aspect of Fallout 4 is a welcome feature.  These two points earn this game two points, but compromising the fundamentals of what made Fallout Fallout subtract the other eight.  The majority of my complaints center around the indisputable fact that Fallout 4 can hardly be described as an RPG.  RPGs require more than just a perk every level.  Removing the skills system which had been in place in some form since 1999 was the first undeniable mistake Bethesda made with Fallout 4.  While Bethesda likes to present their games as a bastion of player choice, it makes no sense to do so when they diminish the player's ability to customize his or her character to anything beyond a shallow extent.  And following the lack of player choice, we find immediately upon starting the game that the ""role"" of our character is barely determined by our choices.  No longer can we create our own back story, determine our own personality, decide whether we want to be family people or murderous villains, because Bethesda has chosen our role for us.  Not only do they do this by deciding upon the aforementioned characteristics and forcing us into a very specific story, but they have done so by voicing our characters with a voice that represents *their* vision, not ours.  Fallout 4 is a world of clear black and white, good and evil.  No longer is there a moral grey area in the wasteland.  No longer are there multiple perspectives of right and wrong.  Instead, Bethesda has intellectually compressed itself into a simple, clear world with little depth and which can appeal only to the shallow.  This is, in essence, the Bioware model.  Without Bethesda to compete with this model, the time of the RPG has died.  Bethesda was the only AAA developer on the market that seemed to be a resistance against the homogenization of games; beyond the shallow offerings that rake in millions of dollars.  Bethesda did something special, and occupied a special, unique place in the gaming landscape, and they eschewed this for...profit perhaps?  But this answer doesn't satisfy me, because ultimately Fallout 4 would have gone on to make millions regardless of what kind of game they made.  So no, I don't think profit explains the hollow shell of Fallout that Bethesda has offered us.  I find the only reasonable explanation left over to be that Bethesda has simply lost sight of their goal and failed to understand what made their product great in the first place.  This lost sight culminates ultimately in a pretty product with no depth.  A game with little replay value.  A solid disappointment.  This game was not made for Fallout fans, this game was made for Call of Duty and Rage fans.  Players who don't want to deal with complexity, reading, moral questions, or choices.  Players who want their choices lain out for them.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this mode of gaming.

I haven't played the previous Fallouts, nor do i plan too after playing this. So with that being said onto the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Some lighting effects (Some shadows, along with AO and rain effects look decent, if not better then the majority of the game) -Minecrafting (can be abit of fun once you play around with it.) -Upgrading/ customizing weapons -Vats is also pretty good (Again, haven't played a fallout previous to this) -Soundtrack (Menu ost is amazing)  Cons: -The Story It's bad, there is no real thing to explain here. Without including any spoilers, its quite possibly the most cliche script i've ever seen. (Apart from multiple factions, which is the only decent portion of it. Even then it still fails because some faction's storylines just F***ing suck compared to the rest. I'm looking at you whoever made the Minutemen Questline....) Endings are also pretty similar.  -Gameplay Again, its the first fallout i've played so far. I've looked at videos of the previous fallout entries, and while fallout 4 has much better gameplay (from the videos that is) than the previous titles, its still extremely slow paced for my taste.  Difficulty AI doesn't become smarter, they become giant bullet sponges while dealing more damage to you. Challenge is pretty much just off-set by better gear.  Weapons While weapon customization is good, most options (And a good majority of weapons) are completely useless. After a while your down to extremely generic weapons that pretty much take up your entire inventory.  (Some gun models don't even have triggers on them, though i won't really include that in the cons)  Graphics It's bad. Really bad. This game is quite possibly the worst looking game i've played within the last 7 years. (Wtf is that foggy white light indoors?)  Optimization My specs: Gtx 960 (2g) FX 6300 8G ram  Lowest AVG FPS :29 (Outside, Inside 35) Highest AVG FPS : 49 (Outside, Inside 57) Settings (High, Godrays off, Shadows are all at high, view distance maxed as well) I understand that i could tinker with my settings for more FPS, and i understand that i don't have a beast gaming PC, and i understand that I'm not using an intel processor (in the mist of upgrading in a week) But for a game that came out LATE 2015, and even if its rendering at a decent distance, this game runs and looks like horse S***. There is no reason why this game is optimized as it is. None. You can't defend this game at any level when it comes to optimization or graphical quality (Other than a few lighting effects of course). I get it, graphics aren't everything, but i shouldn't be playing a game that looks like it came out in 2007 in 2015.  Voice Acting  Some Voice actors sound much better than others, however alot of the voices sound as if there coming from B rated actors (Hell even C rated sometimes). Enemy voice acting is pretty decent however.  Side Quests 90% of them are generic fetch quests. (However some random encounters are much better than others).  Mixed opinions on subjects are as followed:   Exploration:  While the world is decently sized, alot of it just feels empty. Locations are mostly closed off, and most locations are pretty much just for taking screanshots and have no real purpose. Which again, is pretty weird considering how hyped-up this game was.    Teammates/Companions  While some of the features of the AI are great (ie, dialog, background, customization). The biggest problem is that its pretty much pointless to have one. The story doesn't change, the AI depending on the situation just likes or hates you for your choice. Along with the fact that they don't die completely, takes the little realism that this game has, out the window.    Perks:  While the concept is pretty good, it's pretty much the same as any RPG. Put X stat in X skill and get X bonus. No real skill tree's or gameplay changes.    Random encounters:  While some do add abit of style to it (The fridge man lol) most are again pretty pointless, aside from getting legendary weapons. They don't add anything to the story the majority of the time, and the ones that do are just really small details.    I don't know if i missed anything but, at this point im just going to call it a night.  All in all, while the game is not a 1, its certainly not worthy of anything over a 5.  This is one of the games that you play when your bored, and like to have mindless fun.  I personally don't know what game the other reviewers (The ones getting 8-10s especially) are playing, but i guess i might be playing a completely different version.

Or until a patch, but the last one was early December and still no major fixes to the game. I suggest leaving this game until it’s been resolved… You have been warned. The main impression I have of the game is the tedious nature of the missions. From constantly being harassed by your settlers as they somehow manage to let themselves be captured again. The annoyance of try to figure out how the game mechanics and how missions work as explanations are incredibly vague at times. But the worse crime is the blatant standing on the shoulder of giants. You can see influences of Mass Effect with its character romances and dial spinning dialog options. Minecraft and is building of settlements and structures. As well as other new improvements that have been fully borrowed and half implemented. It’s a shame as there are some small glimmers over shadowed by major game coding flaws and underutilised concepts. Like for example you get to build your own bases with scrap found from the wasteland, nice concept… liking it. Yet there are some blindly obvious things Fallout missed, making this ultimately a huge fail. First and foremost is no mass way to arm settlers, you literally have to talk to everyone and trade with them independently. Also why not have a base test, throw some raider at the walls, and let me see my settlement defences working out? A huge mistake was to allow you to own more than one settlement to be built in the wasteland. It means three quarters of the game is wasted just picking up junk and transporting it back to feed your settlements. Ironically you do this in the hopes that your one of many settlements will leave you alone, defend themselves for a change, but it doesn’t happen. It’s a vicious circle that gobbles up your time and will eventually leave you with a bitter taste in your mouth. The story really highlights how bad it has become. I methodically play the game destroying evil and rise to become the leader of the faction I choose. But at some point, really close to the end, you lose all choice. You are pointed down a few roads, none you feel particularly happy about, but you have to take without deviation. Why... because fallout endings have always sucked just a little just like war and war never changes.… Expand "

Oh and please make the settlements self defending If I set up guard posts and turrets and blumming walls, I should not have to trek from 1 side of the map to the other every verse end while I am in the middle of something else to ""help defend"" it  and yes the UI really does suck, but hopefully when the modding community really get going these issues may be resolved  So if you are expecting a fallout game in the true fallout fashion you will be a tad disappointed with FO4.… Expand "

The color infusion has really helped to make the world beautiful in all its wasteland devastation. This without sacrificing the core feeling of the series (Fallout 2, still the best Fallout game, was not a game without color). 2. One of the major issues with Fallout 3 has been addressed in that the game no longer has a hard ending; you can keep exploring and leveling infinitely. 3. The main story line is really good and the voice actors do a great job.  What Fallout 4 does less well and fails miserably at. 1. The same bugs as always in Bethesda games are ever present. Its amazing that they put this much time into developing a game without properly addressing these issues. A role playing game is all about suspension of disbelief. This can never be accomplished in a game where NPC's keep walking into walls all the time, where Brahmin spawn on top of roofs and where the dialogue is either repetitive (an arrow to the knee) or doesn't make sense. NPC's will still say stuff like ""I hope you know how much you did for us... you ain't here looking for trouble are you?"". They will be familiar with you one second and forget you exist the very next. 2. Combat is still horrible, just as horrible as always. Clunky, unnatural and nowhere near the improvements that were promised pre release. This is a huge problem as 75 % of your game time usually will consist of combat. 3. Settlement management is just too buggy. This is really sad as this could have been the salvation of the title. I have spent 50 + hours just managing settlements and it's frustrating to see how well this could have worked and how horribly it does work in the end. Construction works fine if you want to build the basic shacks that the templates are meant to construct. However if you try to build anything more advanced it quickly gets frustrating. Building blocks wont work together in a smooth way. Also the object limit per settlement is a major drawback. After a while you begin to wonder why you bother with settlements, there are no real rewards apart from modest vendor incomes. If I ever start over with a new character I wont bother with settlements, I'll just build a garage for my own storage and workbench needs.  All in all, Fallout 4 is not a bad game. It just isn't what the pre release hype promised and a bitter disappointment after Skyrim that took Bethesda games to a new level.… Expand "
pfyfe441,"Apr  8, 2017",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Ok so, I don't normal do reviews and created an account just for this. This game sucks. I was one of the many people waiting for years for this game, I have played all the Elder Scrolls and previous Fallout games and when it came to this I was shocked to see how lazy Bethesda has become.  1. The graphics are horrible. Yes most people argue graphics aren't everything and I agree, they aren't, but when the graphics are a have minor improvements to the previous game made on old gen hardware, something is seriously wrong. Many would argue that for an open world game the graphics will need to be downgraded to run but just look at the Witcher 3.  2. Gameplay. Yes this is an improvement from the previous games however it feels like a cheap Call of Duty rip off.  3. Story is awful. I normal don't look for amazing stories in RPG's (this isn't an RPG) however they are always a plus. The story in Fallout 4 is awful. It feels fine and well past after the first 4 missions then it speeds up to an unoriginal mess of a story with characters no one cares about. It tries to play on old players nostalga bring back characters such as Doctor Li, Liberty Prime and Arthur Maxson. This annoyed me greatly as instead of making new and interesting characters they bring a robot, an up tight **** and a spoil child who thinks he's a man. There is no real choices in this game. Let the Institute live or blow a big hole in the ground. WOW! Also part of the final battle has you holding hands with a giant robot as it is incapable to walk on its own, sound familiar?  4. UI and dialogue. Dialogue is bad. Real bad. Here are you options. The friendly option, the sarcastic option, the **** option, a question option and sometimes an awful persuasion attempt to get and extra 25 caps to go fetch some random farmer his carrots back from some Super Mutants. Stop trying to copy Mass Effect, Bethesda. UI is so poor, so bland and plain.  5. Crafting. The crafting was a welcome feature for me when it came to this game. However there is no tutorial at all guiding you, showing you how to build this and that. Once I figured it all out and began enjoying it.... then it became repetitive and boring.  Here are some-things I would also like to note. Bad animation, horrible performance on consoles and sometimes on PC, buggy and has not been patched since release, some horrible voice acting, honestly quite a boring location, perk chart is a horrible idea, lip sync is so annoying, Bethesda are too dependent on modders to fix their game for them, has no RPG elements to it apart from character creation and Bethesda, please don't ever have a voiced protagonist again.  All in all this is a bad game. Without the Fallout name in front of it, it's nothing more than a poor shooter copying Call of Duty. Bethesda, you should be ashamed.… Expand "

I found, however, an experience that felt shallow/static, and the more I pressed forward in search of that moment which would engage me, the more it became clear that real fun would not be found.  There are more features at play here (crafting and settlement construction), but the core of the game has not evolved from previous Beth releases, while other developers have genuinely pushed the industry forward.  For example, the voice acting is improved, but the writing is just boring and without the flair of talent.  Additionally, the UI was maddening, and I never developed the muscle memory for it.  The world itself is attractive, but feels static since there is little evidence of motion in it.  The town's are tiny, as well, and outside of that, the gameplay really is just ""shoot everything.""  It doesn't feel like an RPG, but rather a mediocre shooter.  If I wanted a shooter, I would buy a shooter.  Makes me wish I could be a fly on the wall to witness the decision-making process.  Maybe I ruined my chance at having fun in this game by playing Skyrim with 230 mods tacked on.  That's a serious possibility.  But consider that I also really enjoyed vanilla Skyrim through two playthroughs before I even knew that mods existed.  As it is, I uninstalled the game, and every few months I will check the mod lists to see if the community has injected some life into the game.  I still have some hope that they will succeed where Beth's imagination went soft.  That hope, though, is tinged with the understanding that turning this game into something more satisfying, and deeper, will be tough considering the game doesn't possess much beyond it's initial veneer.… Expand "

Fallout 4 is a mediocre, lame, uninspired experience. It's something you will regret playing, it's something that will loose your interest like a goldfish, and it's something you just wish was done better. It's an experience that leaves you with a bitter shovelware aftertaste.  Every single core aspect of this game feels underdone, rushed and primitive. From rudimentary RPG elements and artless voice acting, to mediocre graphics and terrible, TERRIBLE optimization.  Ever wondered what an RPG would look like if stripped of most RPG elements? If you guessed ""sh*t"", then you're pretty close to getting the core idea behind Fallout 4. Progression is absolutely trashed, with butchered skills and meaningless SPECIAL the experience is bland and doesn't differ much from play-through to play-through. It simply doesn't matter - no matter what you do, every time you will end up with the same bloody character.  Forget being specialized in a weapon class. Forget deep character customization, there's none of that here.  Game mechanics are so ironed, so simplified and so pre-digested that it makes you wonder whether Bethesda treats you like a brain amputee or the game was in fact designed for baby seals.  Writing is a special subject with this one as it hits all the records of triviality and stupidity, even by the very low standards of Bethesda. Fallout 4 is easily the dumbest and the blandest story from Bethesda so far. And perhabs the biggest issue here is cold, under-thought world with NO depth to it. All of the characters are absolutely superficial, they don't have anything to them - not even the main ones!  It feels like you wander across a ghost town with uncanny robots all over you, nobody of them ever feels like a real human.  For instance, NOBODY in this game ever WANTS anything. Nobody ever expresses any wish for anything. Nobody ever makes any plans whatsoever. They are quite literally like goldfish with no own will, they only exist as a means to your quest, and distinguish themselves little from the furniture or the scenery.  Only the main characters have some simple personal traits, but even they function without any kind of motive or will. This makes them feel like brainwashed cultists who's sole reasoning seems to be ""because cthulhu commands so"". All characters act according to the ideologies of their faction(there are only 3), with no personal incentive or interest. All other non faction npcs and raiders don't have a will and a point to their lives.  ""Good writing.""  The Institute makes androids just because why not. The Brotherhood hates androids just because ""it's technology"".  You will never even remember the characters once you're done with the game. They are meaningless, and they will be gone.  The Institute itself is a freaking joke. It's a major plot device and perhaps the biggest letdown in the story. It's a token of how old, rusty and unimaginative the writers of Bethesda have become.  Throughout the game's exposition you're immensely hyped to finally meet the institute. And when you do finally get there, what f*cking mysteries do you discover?  They make androids. That's it.  You know they've been doing androids SINCE FALLOUT 3! This isn't even spoilers cause there's nothing to spoil. They don't make nothing else. No awesome super-weapons, no mind-boggling experiments, NOTHING.  And what about he story itself? Guess what's it about. If you said it's about searching your dad, you're almost right. It's about searching your son.  Player choices, a token of the Fallout series, are a joke. There is either A or B, often you aren't given even that, and frequently both A and B result in the same thing.  The dialogue is shrunk, so are your choices as well. It's either ""Tell me more"", ""Yes"", ""No"" or ""Goodbye"". Genius. Do you remember dialogues from the previous games?  Voiced protagonist my *ss. And the voice acting is mostly mediocre, with only small sparks of good acting.  Bethesda has done nothing to improve on the game and the genre, there is no innovation and even the basic mechanics are just poor and limited. The core pillars of a fallout experience - progression and writing - are a f*cking shame in this game, cut, butchered mess with no proper concept. What were those greedy bastards thinking?… Expand "

Можно так сказать, я являюсь огромным фанатом игр серии The Elders Scrolls и Fallout, причем фол я узнал уже в бетездовском исполнении. Начиная с Моровинда я ""заиграл"" все их последующие игры до дыр, совершил наверное миллионы установок модов за многие разы перепрохождений. Сказать что я ждал новую игру с нетерпением - ничего не сказать. Но к моему разочарованию я получил совсем не то чего так долго ждал. Чтобы все было понятно задам себе тут вопрос: ""Что я хотел увидеть в новой части игры?"" Думаю с ответом на него со мной согласятся многие игроки. Я хотел увидеть развитие наработок Вегаса, все хорошее старое вместе с новыми возможностями, увлекательный сюжет, проработку персонажей и диалогов, и мир который хотелось бы изучать. ВСЕ. А получил я в итоге: выпиленное все то хорошее что было в Нью Вегасе (крафт патронов и оружия, хардкор режим, далее подробней); убитую систему диалогов; тупорылую озвучку главного героя; жену и ребенка (на которых мне наплевать потому что я их вижу в игре 5 минут, но как не странно они являются движущей силой всего сюжета); порезанную систему прокачки, абсолютно несуразную и дибильную, которая ограничена уровнем персонажа; новый крафт, идея которого неплоха, но выполнена плохо (крафт, каким он был в NV убили, вместо того чтобы добавить новые возможности к отличным старым фишкам они все выпилили. В игре пропало чувство ""полные штаны радости"" от того что нашел в какой то трудной локации отличную винтовку, которая в магазине стоит больше тебя, просто потому что оружия тупо НЕТ. Вместо этого есть дибильные пистолеты которые можно улучшить до вундервафель, разнообразия это нисколько не принесло. Зато теперь единственный стимул лезть в какие то дыры, логова рейдеров и супермутантов это МУСОР, да мусор, из которого мы клепаем заборы и прицелы для пушек. Ожидал увидеть глубокую кастомизацию стволов, а не улучшение пистолета до снайперской винтовки 50го калибра, писал бы про этот крафт вечно, но надо идти дальше); куда уж в отзыве про Фол4 без жалобы на силовую броню в первом квесте? Вместо того чтобы показать новые возможности брони и ""сюжетным"" способом отобрать ее у игрока, например сломать ее в бою с Когтем смерти, нам дарят самую имбовую штуку в игре, и вся игра превращается в симулятор силовой брони. Скажете можно отказаться же.. конечно можно, но ведь она продается у торговцев, просто так валяется во многих местах, дается по сюжету несколько раз. По силовой броне можно было сделать целую квестовую цепочку, чтобы достать ее из самых опасных подземелий по кусочкам, и тогда игрок ощутил бы всю радость от того, что НАКОНЕЦ ТО он оденет этот божественный доспех. Само собой чтобы это был единственный способ получить силовую броню. Но увы; вся бронь, кроме силовой, выглядит убого, одеть реально нечего, кроме СБ; отсутствие хардкорного режима вообще возмущает. Зачем строить дом, кровать, место для готовки еды если спать и есть в принципе то не обязательно?; отсутствие репутации и кармы; не развитая толком система постройки, для галочки, где можно сделать промышленную водоочистную установку, мощные электрогенераторы, турели, но нельзя сделать нормальный дом без текущей крыши и дырявых стен. Поселения статичные и мертвые, кроме игрока никто ничего не делает, только если пальцем ткнуть мол иди поли грядки итп. А если занять ту же бензоколонку то на нее тупо нельзя поставить двери (вообще эта фича с постройкой поселений изначально мертвая, но можно было сделать толково, раз такой упор на нее сделали); разнообразия ноль, везде натыканы рейдеры и супермутанты, локации красивы внешне, но уровни это копипаста из лесниц и этажей; и наконец то, самое главное - сюжет! Сюжета нет. Главная сюжетная ветка настолько тупорылая, что слов нет... Сайд квесты генерируемая копипаста, сходи убей, сходи принеси. Если многое из вышесказанного можно исправить модами, то сюжет не исправить ни как. Игра пустая, безжалостно тупая, порезанная, упрощенная до не могу. Очень жаль выливать столько говна на Бетезду, действительно жаль. Как я писал выше я провел уйму времени в TES и Fallout, верный так сказать фанат их творчества. Надеюсь эту игру зальют таким количеством негатива, что в будущем они даже не подумают выкатывать на рынок такой огрызок. Хватит все упрощать, вместо того чтобы делать игры глубже и сложнее вы делаете поверхностное кинцо для дибилов с наивным сюжетиком и собачкой. И чтобы добавить в конце соли на рану так сказать, маленькое обращение: уважаемая Bethesda Game Studios, МАМОНТ игровой индустрии, мастера рпг, посмотрите на своих коллег из CD Projekt Red. То творение которое они недавно выпустили в виде Ведьмака 3 настолько крутое, что в сравнении с ними, исходя из качества вашего последнего продукта, вы кажетесь просто кучкой недоучек вместе с друзьями из Bioware которые не годятся даже полы мыть в их студии.

Thankfully it seems that I wasn't alone in my immense disappointment of this game, the 0/10 scores are definitely not justified but simple the reaction of incredibly angry fans. Had this game came out under another name, anything other than Fallout, it would have been met with a decent reception and probably been a 7-8/10 game. But that is not the case here, Fallout is an old franchise with a hardcore, dedicated core fan base that froths RPG, so it's no wonder so many people have reacted so negatively to what was delivered.  The mod community will surely come in and clean parts of this game up, provide alternative entertainment and quest but the real problem that no mod will ever solve is the ingrained linear story, the voiced dialogue, which leads to the offensively simple response options of Yes/No/Maybe/Info, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and tied perk chart and the basic idea that you cannot be your own character.  You are Bethesdas character, going through Bethesdas world, making Bethesdas choices, being who Bethesda says you are.  THE GREAT - - Weapon Modding - Armor Modding - General Gun Play  THE OKAY - - Base Building/Settlements - Graphics/Performance (worked on my PC with XBOX controller really well)  THE BAD - - Removal of Skills - Dialogue Options - Voice Acting - Removal of Karma/Reputation - Removal of Hardcore/Survival Mode (despite the world still being littered with water, food and cooking stations?!) - Small/Empty Map - Repetitive Enemies/Quests - Sooo many more, just read other negative reviews  Fallout 4 was going to be my life for the next few months, hell, I had even pre-ordered the collectors edition I was THAT excited. That excitement has already gone, I will drop at least 100 hours into this game (60hrs already) but as for replay-ability? What's the point? Your character isn't unique to bother doing the game again, it only has 2 different endings so you might bother to do the game again, but seriously, after playing it once you'll be done.  Go get New Vegas during a Steam sale, watch a youtube video on what mods to install, figure it out like a big boy and enjoy a vastly superior game to this embarrassment.… Expand "

The gun mechanics are fantastic. The gun mechanics just works. Fallout 3 had clunky mechanics, VATs felt at home in this world, FO4 fixes this and I am never clicking Q. The guys are enjoyable and seamless.  The radio host is hilarious. The voice acting is good. The lighting looks great. I forgot how much I enjoyed doing the hacking mini-game. Alright, I can stop here. Onto the bad.  The quests so far have hideous dialogue. Early in the game you meet up with the minuteman. They immediately lead with there being power armor on the roof; they have no reason to trust the main character, they are concerned about getting this power armor but also seem unconcerned with the armor falling into the wrong hands. Weirdness of this nature continues with almost every quest.  The map is tiny and completely devoid of anything resembling historical new England. Seriously, there are no features of Concord MA that look anything like Concord. The geography isn't even remotely similar. Concord is built around a roundabout, this is missing. This isn't concord. Similarly unrecognizable Bedford, Lexington, and even Boston.  The game doesn't look good. The textures--while they use 3GB+ video ram--do not look good.  The AI is quite bad. You can get monsters to glitch into corners and trap themselves, as I did with the first death claw. Monsters will yell that they saw you before turning. Monsters will not see you when you are really close. It is bad.  The dog is really glitchy and annoying. Sure he can open doors and heals instantly when you travel through load screens. Whatever, companions are just as bad as they were before. No points deducted.  The game runs like absolute **** This will be fixed, i know. But it really runs worse than my old hardware did on fallout 3 and doesn't look much better/ Not marking down any points for this.… Expand "

The excellent writing previous in the series (admittedly, not the Bethesda one) has been completely thrown out for some attempt at Mass Effect dialogue. It's the illusion of choice, very similar to a McDonald's burger. You can add and take away as much as you want from a McD's burger and it will make no difference because the foundations are painfully average, much like Fallout 4.  Have you ever thought that Fallout 4 would be better if it wasn't an RPG? No, nobody has. Bethesda seems to think the people just want a shooting gallery with arbitrary numbers.  What people want is a Fallout game. What people got was Skyrim with guns, with somehow even less RPG components. I wouldn't be surprised if the next Elder Scrolls is basically a first person Zelda game at this point.  The story is exactly the same as Fallout 3 but with axis tilted slightly to fit in with the commonwealth. I can't believe how lazy this idea was. If New Vegas was accomplished in around a year and a half, how is Fallout 4 in this state after four years? It would've made sense if they changed engine. But they didn't.  This is still gamebryo and it's the anchor that just holds down Fallout 4 from being painfully mediocre to a solid ""meh.""  What I did enjoy was exploring the world and the gunplay. That's about it though. The settlement building is incredibly tedious. Despite advertising itself as completely optional, several instances in the main quest will shove it down your throat.

And it wasn't because of some nostalgic FO 1-2 ""love-in"".

They still haven't fixed some of this engine-level micro-stutter stuff that's plagued Bethesda games since at least Oblivion (2007) - The ugliest UI imaginable. Remember the stock Oblivion & Skyrim's UI's that everyone quickly downloaded mods to fix? Well this is worse than those but there seems to be no equivalent of ""DarnifiedUI"" and ""SkyUI"" at time of writing (which itself is 2 months after launch). Once is ""acceptable"" but Bethesda seem to have some serious long-term learning disability when modders have to finish their games for them 4 times in a row... - Inventory management is hideous (not helped by the fact the inventory takes up barely 1/9th of the screen with the remaining 8/9ths just wasted). Items themselves are just an A-Z mess with little sensible category grouping. Good God, I have 1997-era RPG's with less painful trading mechanics than this - Maps (especially local) are totally useless - Those awful dumbed down ""Mass Effect"" style conversation options (Yes, No, Sarcastic) where the conversation lines and the summary regularly don't match up, leaving you thinking ""WTF?!? I didn't select that!"" half the time - Hugely consolized. Simple stuff like you can't click on a conversation option anymore. You have to use the cursor keys. Problem is, when you're walking past someone and a conversation auto-starts up, you then accidentally select the ""Up"" option (from still walking forward if using the cursor keys for movement). Likewise, if you bind say ""Use"" to RMB, then issuing commands to followers is just right clicking - but so too is opening containers, so almost every other time you go to search a container you ""ask"" your companion to stand in front of it instead. ESC doesn't exit menu's nor does clicking the same key, eg, I to open inventory then I again to close (like almost every PC game written since the 90's including Oblivion & Skyrim). If I wanted to be forced to use a controller, I'd go buy a console... - Building settlements is mostly pointless and feels ""tacked on"". It's just another thing to micro-manage for little gain. If you're not there to defend it, it'll get flattened if attacked, so why bother? - Can't enter 90% of buildings in many areas. I think Morrowind's (2002) Dunmer villages had more immersion & atmosphere than this - Quicksave's randomly go missing. Happened twice now and I definitely didn't delete them myself - Dumb ""hacking"" mechanics - Ludicrously ""bullet spongy"" enemies on ""Normal"", even for a Bethesda game. A 3s burst, up close from a minigun and a simple human ""Raider"" keeps coming without a hair out of place? Seriously? - The usual ""Bethesda Bugs"" (plot / faction quest glitches, environmental clipping / iffy collision detection, conversation timing, etc) - General writing & voice acting is poor. The intro was good. Unfortunately the intro WAS the most interesting and immersive part of the game - RPG? What RPG? With the removal of skills and Karma, the dumbed down ""simple dialogue"" (because even speaking in sentences is 'too hard' for 'the modern casual audience'?), the dumbed down perks, that the ""Power Armor + Minigun"" is virtually given to you in Hour 1, ""combat is the only option"", etc, and it's turned into more of a badly paced shooter than anything RPG-like. Bethesda have been ""stream-lining"" since Morrowind. Some stuff was needed, other stuff not so much but still arguably acceptable. But this time, they've literally ""stream-lined"" the whole RPG feel out of Fallout franchise well into the realms where ""dumbed down"" isn't some relative opinion up for debate. It simply IS...  Bottom Line : It's buggy, consolized, boring & non-immersive (post-intro). I'll give it 2 (for the intro & soundtrack), but I'm not remotely enjoyable ""playing"" a game where you spend nearly all the time fighting not to save your son, but against hideous UI & controls, and conversation & inventory mechanics that are another step back  from ""PC UI lessons (obviously not) learned"" in Bethesda games sold 9 years ago...… Expand "

The game needs more content, it needs the graphics cleaned up, it needs the UI redone, as, once again, they simply ported it over from the console version.

Here's what you'll enjoy: - More of the F4 world - New base building - Interesting new equipment mechanics - New and interesting perks - More action and fighting focus  Here's what you may dislike: - Dated graphics engine - A reliance of mod community to clean up some of the graphics, fix power suit balances, and essentially rely on the community to refine the game. - Shallow characters and stilted dialogue - More action and fighting focus  You might be wondering why I give it a 6, because honestly it is not a bad game, the controls and FPS component feel more refined, the world appears to be well detailed, the seed community's allowing players to build a town is a great idea, and the atmosphere of F3 is still present. What F4 is missing, imo, is character.  The dialogue is terrible, you obtain equipment far to easily, and have access to the power suit quite early on. The beginning of F4 is painstakingly boring (for me), and I [spoiler]    before we really get to enjoy our family or create a bond they are ripped away - I don't know them enough to care....  Suggestions: - Give the player a powersuit but have it break after using it the first time; the player is given time to VALUE the immense power of the suit, so that they work towards it's repair. Create value for players so they see the need to use the suit and how important it is. - Spend more time with your family or don't make the story about your family if you can only attribute 10 minutes of gameplay to them. Perhaps make it about your family, but cryogenic damage has caused memory loss, or someone has implanted memories that were never there....give me a reason to care Bethesda....give us a unique story....  I feel my gripe lies heavily in what feels like an unpolished gem, that will only get better once the modding community and DLC for the game comes out. The game is fine, playable, but by no means GOTY quality, or has the same enjoyable traits as F3; but I can't ignore the fact that it does a ""good"" job, and not a ""great"" job. So if you like the Fallout world and want more of the same-ish, add it to you list. If you were expecting something different, innovative, and there to create RPG memories, it just didn't draw me in like the previous Fallout's have.… Expand "
MeritCoba,"Nov 20, 2015",5," I have opted for a simplified scoring system, with 5 being a meh. Fallout 4 gets a five from me because a one is a bit too harsh and thus it escapes a four, which is what it deserves.

Fallout 4 gets a five from me because a one is a bit too harsh and thus it escapes a four, which is what it deserves.  Enough has been said by others and I will not repeat what has been said before ad nauseam other then to note that Bethesda has finally done away with the roleplay elements of the game, which isn't really a surprise as we shall see shortly. In fact it is the goal Bethesda has been progressing towards.  I will concentrate on what for me simply breaks a game, which is the story. In this respect Bethesda has been very consistent in that none of their flag ship games, being the Elder scrolls series and the Fallout series, have anything resembling a good story. Take the story lines of both Oblivion and Skyrim, they are very similar and just bare bones enough to get you out into the world. The world is basically a sandbox where you can roam around doing repeat missions that have no consequences. Go and kill some elder dragons up on the mountain and return to town to find out that nothing has changed. In Skyrim Bethseda has made boring what in other games is the summon of tension: fighting dragons. Next we will see fights with demons, as boring as can be(compare this to Dragon Age III)  Fallout is now the same game as the Elder scroll series. It is a sandbox game that has a flimsy storyline to get you going. It is so inconsequential that the game spends less then 10 minutes on your background story, it might be longer if you take the time to extensively alter your look.The whole story in a nutshell: a short introduction to your family, after which you agree to a place in the nearby Vault. Then the alarms sound, you run to the Vault getting while the bombs drop. You get frozen in, wake up for unknown and unexplained reasons, to see your partner getting killed and your kid stolen. Some unknown time passes and you get out of your cryogenic module, to find everyone in the Vault dead. Except for the radroaches, that is. It ends when you escape to the surface to enter the world of Fallout.  Fallout fails as a story because there is nothing to make you go out there. There is no imminent danger, no sword of Damocles or time limit. There is no evil character to beat, a threat to thwart or a world to save. My son is supposed to be the MacGuffin that ought to get me going, but since nobody else is(Maltese Falcon: everyone wants it) there is no pressure and, given that no time is spend on making him matter to me, I basically don't care what happens to him. In fact I know nothing will happen to him as the story won't progress unless I talk to the next NPC in line. He is so unimportant that I even forgot his name until it popped up in my conversation options.  This game now has the option to build things, not that it matters to the world at large. It won't get any safer or more advanced. In fact nothing happens. The same goes for the killing of all the monsters and raiders. What you get is empty looted places, not safe havens: the beginnings of a new civilization. You make a wasteland by killing everything and then that might be called peace.  Someone compared it to State of Decay and indeed even that game shows how soulless Fallout has become. In State of Decay you cared for your small group of survivors and building mattered for it made your base safer and for you especially when you had to find resources that were important and in short supply. It also had a story with a definite end and a heightened pressure when more deadly monsters appeared. There were many faults in State of Decay, but you felt that it what you did mattered, you had your favorite survivors you cared for and gave the best of your equipment.  And this then compared to the empty world of Fallout. No story to be had, no characters to care for, you don't matter, the world doesn't matter and nothing matters. It is a sandbox where you can roam around for ever for there are always randomly spawned monsters and raiders around the corner. It has no story and no soul. How utterly soulless it has become is shown by the fact that any humor is lacking. This game is as dry as a desert and devoid of life as a graveyard. Compare that to Fallout 1 and 2.  And this is what Bethesda wants. Offering a sandbox game without a story so they don't have to spend time on writing, without roleplay elements so they can go on forever, and with just shooting and looting. What is next? Fallout online or Elder Scrolls online no doubt. Perhaps that already exist? Maybe. It is what a MMO is basically: sand box games with a flimsy story. Soulless worlds.… Expand "

Your options are pretty much limited to being a good guy. Take a look at DA: Inquisition and give us different voices to choose from next time Bethesda.  2. The overall story is a bit uninteresting and you didn't get enough time during the intro to really grow to care about your family or the world. (the intro movie is actually excellent, but the rest is just ""meh"")  3. Performance can still get pretty crappy even on my machine (Sapphire 390X 8GB Tri-X OC + FX9590 @ 5 GHz + 16 GB RAM) [partially due to mods]  As for the good things:  1. Weapon customization - probably the best improvement over Fallout 3 given how much it lets you personalize your weapons. But it needs more base weapons along with some decals/colors/whatever that you can add. (modders to the rescue fortunately)  2. a) The companions are convincing and really well voice-acted and you grow to like many of them for their own personalities.  b) I love the way you've recorded so many names for Codsworth to call you. More of this in future games, for at least all main NPCs!  c) The ""romance"" plots are a marked improvement over Skyrim but they're still very shallow compared to e.g. Bioware games.  3. Everything else is pretty great. Love the atmosphere with immersive weather events like radiation storms, building settlements, etc. It's nice to see Bethesda bring in more of the immersion features that are so popular in mods.  These are my main thoughts that come to mind at the moment. I still have a long way to go and yet to even finish the main quest but at this moment I think the game will be worth your money. It feels like it has quite a lot of replay value. Will see if I update this review later.… Expand "

The score would be more like a 2 or 3.   As an FPS it's probably more like a 7 or 8 I'm thinking.    Action/Adventure/Comedy?? meh...    So the good?  What I liked  - Atmospherics.  Rain, Radiation storms, vegetation (yeah it's dead but it's there), clouds.  It's feels more like what you might expect a post apocalyptic world to be like. (maybe not 200 years later but...) - I think the people actually do look different from each other compared to FO3 - The fallout franchise Finally figured out how to make the dangers of radiation poising have a real practical effect. - They included some FPS things, like a grenade button. - I actually thought the voice acting was well improved with respects to the quality of delivery over FO3 and NV. - Some quest items have time limits.  I know some people hate this, but I also liked my companions to actually be able to die.   I prefer the real consequences over the idea that raiders would actually sit on an abducted settler for months until you get around to killing their camp. - You can really build the home of your dreams (mostly). - Creatures are more interesting.  Burrowing, crawling out of holes.  Clinging to walls, etc.  The Bad.... - It's not really an RPG, it's an open world FPS. (that's got to be the worst of the worse) - Your character development is almost irrelevant.  Other than leveling up for more hit points. - Dialog options are pretty much gone now. - Your settlements become tedious (seriously do I have to literally rescue them all the time?) - Hardcore mode? - Lots of Mutants, lots of ghouls - City flavor is missing (more on that below) - The bones of Fallout 1 & 2 are just about gone now.  I know a lot of people are complaining about the graphics, and some of the glitches.  I watched a dead mirelurk fall from the sky after I reloaded a quick save.  But those are mostly inconsequential.  It seems to me that Bethesda looked at what the modding community was doing and took some of the well executed ones and added it to FO4.   Environmental effects, and building.    I was excited for the idea that I could carve out a settlement the way I imagined.   Instead, I'm dealing with a bunchy of whiny settlements that never seem to take care of themselves.  However I had a concern after FO3 that they might try to slide into their Elder Scrolls territory with a sequel.  Instead it appears they're trying to squeak out a pure FPS but can't quite bring themselves to do it.  And really they shouldn't.    There's lots of other games that do that better.  So when I said the ""flavor"" is missing I mean it like this.  I used to (and still do) play FO3 just to wander into the capital wasteland and feel the oppressive, ruin of a world brought to it's knees by bombs, and just what might be around the corner.    The look, the feel.   Imagining what that building might hold if I could just get inside somehow.  Instead in FO4 I try to find the quickest route some where cause I get tired of running into ONE MORE RAIDER SETTLEMENT blocking the street.   Or if it's not a raider it's super mutants.    It's less about discovery and more about fighting.   Which many others have pointed out is all you really do in the service of pretty much every quest.  Save some one by killing everything.  Bring a new settlement into the fold by doing a quest for them to kill every thing.  Someone giving you a problem?  Eh, kill em.  Might as well.  So the joy of discovery for me has been largely, largely, stamped out by knowing that all I'm pretty much going to do after killing all the ______ (fill in the blank) is find a building full of junk to scrap.  FO4 implemented the same scheme that Diablo has done for years by adding some kind of unique effect to their weapons or armor to make it stand out from the crowd.    Was kind of fun at first, but honestly, it stopped being of much interest a dozen hours in when you see the same things keep showing up.   There's room to improve this with patching or DLC.  To conclude, if you like just going out and shooting stuff, you might like this.   If you like RPGs you won't really get what you want.    Hopefully two things come out of this.  First, we can hope Oblivion Entertainment gets another shot at a Fallout with a follow-up to New Vegas.   Second, hopefully Bethesda, goes back to the RPG core that made this game what it is.   But please not Skyrim with a robots.  Fallout 1 & 2 were loved for a reason!… Expand "

A mod author does it for free and can stop modding games made by the company whenever they want. Modding is a great way to enhance the fun of the game, but game companies should not rely on them, they should focus on making a game that is fun without mods.

The new additions of crafting weapons and home building is uninspiring. When getting unique weapons tied to quests or beautifully imagined locations in New Vegas your left with a feeling of accomplishment rather then the bland and easily collected modular weapons in Fallout 4. Having played the game years ago and revisiting it when possible New Vegas still leaves players daydreaming of the days they played and slowly discovered all the interesting intertwined story elements unlike Fallout 4's leaving you to forget much of the locations (excluding Far Harbor) and story elements. Many new to the series might wonder why so many reviews are unhappy with the game they might find very interesting, but to those who played the original Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas even when being released 5 years prior (New Vegas) are still assuredly better iterations in the series and a more indents look at the Fallout universe, while only being in development for 18 months (yes, obsidian developed the game in its entirety in under 2 years).

Kardox,"Dec 10, 2015",6," My review is based on around 20 hours in the game. And so far this game reminds me an MMO.

I am a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls series but the ESO was a disappointment to me. Unfortunately Fallout 4 is also a disappointment. Here is why.  The main plot in Bethesda's RPGs has always been dull. But this has always been compensated by absolutely fantastic side quests. In Fallout 4 the side quests are a total disappointment and all are MMO like. They are all about: go kill those guys, bring this, bring that. There are no stages. What an npc tells you to do is exactly what will need to be done. There are no unexpected twists or anything intriguing.  The settlement building feels like an MMO time sink. This all reminded me the garrison building in World of Warcraft. There are several settlements that you can build in the game. For each of them you need to collect tons of resources. Reading the reviews of the critics I guess there are plenty of people who enjoy this part of the game but for me this Minecraft/World of Warcraft copying got old very soon. It's all very repetitive and pointless really. Feels like mindless grind.  The graphics is nothing to write home about if you played the Witcher 3. I would say that it's year 2012 quality. And in general if you give the Witcher 3 a 10 then the Fallout 4 is a 6. People play single player RPGs for the story and the immersion. Bethesda again confused the priorities. In the Elder Scrolls online they made a single player RPG with MMO elements. As a single player ESO was weaker than previous installments. But the MMO part also felt alien. It's the same thing with the Fallout 4. A lot of MMO elements but now in a purely offline game. What's the point? Why not make a Fallout online instead?  I really wanted to write something positive about this game but it's average in every respect. I was totally blown away by the Witcher 3 storyline, the open world and the graphics.

That would explain a lot of things.  Things, such as, my first encounter with a Deathclaw at the very start of the game. Round one - I open my Pip-Boy to use a Stimpack, and can't close it. Deathclaw stands, bemused, next to my motionless body. Re-load. Round two - I decide to hide in one of the buildings which is working quite well. Deathclaw runs away and doesn't come back. Eventually I go in search to find that he's stuck on a pile of rocks. Shoot him a couple of times before he teleports around behind me and rips my limps from my torso. Re-load. Round three...well, you get the idea.  Like all Bethesda releases, there are a ton of bugs at launch. Some are minor annoyances, some are immersion-breaking, and others require you to load the game from your most recent save. This may have been more acceptable seven years ago in the days of Fallout 3, but we've seen so many super-polished games with massive worlds since then, eg: Witcher 3, GTA5, etc. The bar has been raised for all open-world games recently, and Bethesda ran right into it and bumped their head.  The Creation Engine is really starting to show its age. I'm normally in the ""graphics don't matter"" camp, but when I actually recognize objects and textures which were lifted right out of Fallout 3 and implanted into 4 without even so much as a re-skin, it irks me. Overall the graphics and presentation is a mixed bag. The exterior views/landscapes are actually great in my opinion. Character models are average. Building interiors and many of the item models/textures are significantly below par by today's standards. Animations are poor and lip-syncing often attains kung-fu-movie levels of awful. This engine has been powering all of their open-world games since the stiff-legged Khajiits of Morrowind floated across screens 13 years ago. It really needs to go.  Ranting out of the way, it's definitely not all bad. When all of the bugs are fixed, I would happily update my review score to a solid 7/10. Improved graphics/textures via modding would hit an 8/10. Sadly nothing will ever fix the awful ""speech wheel"", wooden dialog and an in-game menu which was invented somewhere in between the discovery of fire and the first wheel.

An option to see what you character is actually going to say before clicking the button would have helped a lot but the game developers seem to have decided that a ""one size fits all"" approach is adequate.  Sadly, for a Fallout game, the emphasis is on action and the maximum numbers of exploding body parts rather then making the quest/dialogue conversations challenging , dependent on your characters abilities, and immersive. I understand that a voiced protagonist consumed a lot of the resources available to develop the game and that enriching the dialogue/RP option/etc would have further increased the cost for the voice acting but for me, and many others, the balance is off as  the rp potential has been severely compromised.  I preordered the game and do not regret that as I am confident the modding community will correct many of the flaws. It's sad though that the game seems to have been designed to be ""thrown over the wall"" to the modding community but many of the issues with the game seem to have been the result of narrowly-focused goals where flexibility was not considered important. Again, ""one size fits all""  I will enjoy the game for what it is- playing at a slow pace- as I like to explore and interact verbally rather than just sequentially  blowing heads off in a shower of blood and complete the game as fast as possible - and will mod the game when possible and slowly move toward seeing and enjoying everything I can in this massive, complex, and enthralling world… Expand "

I enjoyed Fallout 3 a lot more regarding that matter.  The map itself is quite large, and what i like in particular is the fact that enemies scale in a certain level range according to region/ ares other then to the players own level.  That means, that if you are very far into the game and have a high level and go back into the starting area, you will be able to crush anything that comes near you with ease. On the other hand, certain areas will be set to high lvl enemies in which you would get crushed if you were to face them early on. I feel this is the more immersive way to go.  Gunplay is good, quite simply put.  However, the way they changed the lvling and skilling system in Fallout 4 is an absolute joke to me. Instead of having the old Fallout 3 way , they decided to go for a very lazy approach in my eyes. The only thing you now get from lvling up is a point you can use to choose a perk for one of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes. We did have this before, but with the addition of you being able to put points into each of these attributes, up to 100 everytime you lvl up. Now you can only go in a rough direction by applying a few points the each attribute at the start. A change i absolutely dislike and influenced my gaming experience quite a bit.  In General , it seems like Bethesda have shifted their focus from an RPG to an Open-World Shooter by dumbing down the role playing elements such as the skill system and dialogue options while significantly improving gun play. Some people may like this change, however, i personally prefer the more RPG based approach of the older titles.

It is without a doubt a step back from New Vegas is just about every way other than texture quality and gunplay. The story, characters, and setting are all generally uninteresting. There are a few good characters and quests here and there but they are few and far between. The big thing that they hyped up prior to release was the settlement building. This mode is tedious and frustrating. It is impossible to create anything original since there are only a few preset structures to create and the way that things have to clip to each other makes it a pain to make something that the developers didn't envision. On top of this, the mode serves no purpose in the overall game. You build a settlement that looks like crap (because there are no nice looking options) and then it sits there and has no effect on anything. It's very disappointing. The world is not interesting and other than a few landmark buildings, it doesn't even look like Massachusetts. New Vegas has more interesting things going on and it was in a desert! I could live with all these problems, but they also decided to tear out the core RPG skills. I'm not even a huge fan of RPGs, in fact I prefer shooters, but this was a lame idea. When you level up you can pick one ""perk"" to get or you can level up one of your SPECIAL skills. Most of the perks are painfully boring or just plan useless. This means that you don't feel your character getting more powerful, and you have little control over them. You also can't be a bad guy. In NV you could choose multiple paths to take, NCR, Legion, Mr. House, etc. There is none of that here and it is very much a linear game which kills any interest I have in replaying it. I normally don't mind linear storylines, but this is Fallout and frankly the story isn't any good. Despite all these issues, I still enjoyed the 40 hours i put into the game. It's not bad, but it's not great. I feel like if i tried to play longer, or starting a new character then my score would go down, but i don't plan on playing this again. I'm also not looking forward to the next game by Bethesda Game Studios.… Expand "

The positives are things like the atmosphere around the areas (which is superb) and the amount of guns/modifications. Now for the bad. The story is absolute wank, and the characters are boring and stale, the story feels like a indie game at best not an AAA which could afford to hire good writers (I've actually honestly been more invested in an Assassins Creed game and I hate them.) The introduction of the speaking main character sounds good on paper, until you realise that there is only one voice so any attempt of roleplaying anyone who isn't a suburban parent is out the window (aided by the railroaded main quest.) Gone are any form of progression in skills, which is a huge disappointment, Bethesda really need to stop streamlining places which worked and were fun, so the different dialogues and skills really needed to be in there. The new outpost building mechanic is fun for a good 10 minutes, but it does encourage you to actually scavenge for items which is a step in the right direction. But the side missions... Oh god the side missions. They seem to have gone in the direction of Skyrim which is instead of writing actual fun believable stories a la Witcher 3 have instead just made people direction posts to the nearest sewer/outpost/camp/etc Now there is no doubt a lot of things will be helped by mods, but why should an AAA game rely on mods to make it fun?

It's not your character there's no decision to make when its just a matter of time before you can have it all  It just isn't an RPG anymore  Of course plenty can be said about the standard of the pc port and the fact we are living in 2015, it's scandalous, surely Bethesda look at the most popular mod downloads list. Which makes it crazy that the UI is a mess on pc  Or that the game is still locking physics to frame rate at just 60 fps, the many bugs and graphical errors such as the quarry  Settlements feel poorly designed and implemented and certainly not very intuitive, possibly the most complex part of the game but not by design.  Weapon customisation is ok but again not very intuitive with the different mods and how you can store them (eg you can scrap weapons so why not let us scrap weapons into the different modded parts). However the gun mechanics are much improved. Armor seems to be an even bigger afterthough and is never explained  All in all for a shooting game with rpg elements ala Borderlands i'd give it 7/10 due to lack of action  However as an rpg in kind with previous interations or the Witcher series i'd give it a 4/10  As codseorth says, how do you polish rust… Expand "

In Fallout 4, there is no freedom of choice. Instead, there are things that other games do well, which they tried to steal and squeeze in, losing their originality in the process.  -The gameplay has become so linear without the Karma system and a proper dialogue choice that it feels like a **** knock-off of Bioshock Infinite.  -The also **** building system feels like a knock off of indie games that sell for 10 dollars in steam, only they do it better. You can build complex things like here like you can in Minecraft, well so what? Why would I play a single player survival game if I wanted to build anything interesting? What a massively pointless, absolute waste of time.  -Perhaps the only thing that has stayed original is the ridiculously complex inventory. Adding to the mess are countless new weapons and mods, which feels like a **** knock off of Borderlands. Trying to make up for a lack of freedom by adding a bunch of guns does not work.  Can't you just stick to your roots and give us a decent open-world experience instead of trying to add ideas other games are better at?

This is a HUGE failure and the single biggest thing ruining the experience. It's simply not possible to define your own character and personality anymore, you have two choices, both defined by Bethesda. It's like roleplaying with a GM who keeps telling you what your character thinks says and does. I know other games the the ""RPG"" label do it but to me this is at odds with the fundamental principle of creating a character and playing a role. Voiced protagonist's work in games like tomb raider or even Mass Effect because those are not really role playing games, they are story's they you watch and take over for the action bits. Fun but not what I was looking for here as all. -2 for the dialogue wheel, 4 options, often the same with what you are actually choosing wreathed in mystery. It's just bad through and through and is another sing that Bethesda wanted to make a cinematic action story rather than a role playing game.  That leaves me with a 4 which I'm going to stick with. I could add points here and there and I could detract points here and there but overall Fallout 4 is a game that could easily of been amazing but by trying to be a different genre and forcing a questionable story and personality on my undermines most of the ""live another life"" feeling that I look for in Bethesda games.

One thing many do not mention is is the sheer amount of magic they ported over from Elder Scrolls, as well as borrowing from Borderlands (random bosses) and Resident Evil (bosses mutate after being hit - WTF!?!).  When added to the magic re-spawn of the same enemies and items at each Point of Interest, after a few days, you will give up any pretense of calling this a Fallout game.  When you get a laser weapon that has the ability to magically poision or frenzy a target, you will forget this is supposed to be Fallout.  The total lack of immersion in Fallout 4 makes it very easy to stop playing and do something else (like write reviews).  Anyone that played F3/FNV cannot say the same thing.  Total list of lies that Todd promised at E3:  ""It just works"" - BS in every regard.  Not only for bugs, but for the lazy/haphazard design.  Floating platforms is good game making?  Settlement happiness arbitrarily dropping, or raiders that magically teleport past the walls and dozens of turrets to constantly kidnap settlers?  If this is working, you are fired.  Volumetric Lights - there is only one (the sun) and it is not fully volumetric, as it just has godrays  Volumetric Shadows -  totally absent  Physically Based Render Engine (PBRE) - The physically based rendering is mostly deactivated, leaving just a deferred render engine (the same thing they have always been using).  They are even using specular maps, which no functional PBRE ever needs.  Destructible Environments - A few pannels that fall off a few special buildings does not qualify as an environment.  When most of the pannels do not even break, just pop-off, it does not even qualify as destructible.  The best thing about F4 is that all the ""professional reviewers"" that failed to notice any of these aspects.  Whether they are incompetent, or shills, they just burned their organization/site.  You need to keep a list of both the reviewer and who they were working for, so that you are never fooled by either of them in the future.  This game will be worth $30 in a year after modders fix and finish most of the half-assed gameplay.  Until then, stay away from this toxic mediocrity and play FNV again (with mods).… Expand "

First off I want to talk about the controls and inventory system.  They should have taken some advice from the modders of skyrim and adjust the pip boy for a better sorting mechanism.  Trying the navigate the pipboy is terrible and un-intuitive.  Also the controls for speech are clearly not design for PC, when you hand is on WSAD, why would you want to lift and go over to the directional pad to make a selection??.  Tabbing to exit on some menu's, while having to press ESC and enter on others is frustrating and hurts the flow of the game.  Just seems like it wasn't well thought out for PC.  Bethesda always overlooks this, almost expecting modders to take what they give them and make it right down the line.  Besides those issues, i haven't had many bugs or crashes ... yet, but the complaints about story are a little over reacting.  When the story is broken up by hours of side quests, searching etc ...it will suffer a little, you have to know that going in.  The dialogue between characters can always be better, you have to go into a game like this understanding that you aren't necessarily playing it for the story but more so for the exploration and adventure (which doesn't mean they get a free pass but know that those aspects probably was not their focus).  I do not like the voice acting for the main character... just feels out of place at times, while i can't picture myself as being the person anymore.  Gameplay is great, shooting mechanics are smooth and response and feel are great.  Graphics are fine, modders will get them to where they need to be.  Open world ... is awesome, map isn't crazy big where i feel completely overwhelmed but its big enough to get a sense that is a lot do and places to explore.  The amount of towns, ""dungeons"", layout is well done and I thoroughly enjoyed stumbling through this world.  TL;DR ... world is great / controls terrible / story/dialogue ok / gameplay/guns are good  I gave it 6 because the controls are just a huge part of the game for me.

The game is trying to make me care about them, but I just don't. I've spent a total of 10 minutes with my wife and son and I'm supposed to care about them? There is no drive to complete the main story which is basically a copy and paste of Fallout 3's story only this time you're looking for your son instead of your father.  Most side quests are generic and predictable. Fetch x, save y and the reward is caps 95% of the time.  I also don't like how you become a Minuteman general and a Brotherhood of Steel member just because you didn't attack them on sight and instead helped them kill a few raiders and ghouls. All you have to do is complete a boring quest and bam, you're suddenly a goddamn general. It just doesn't make sense and it feels very rushed. You also get a power armor and a minigun with 1000 bullets literally an hour into the game.

I have grown used to bugs, sadly in many games in recent years, but legally now in the EU, a game which cannot play through the main quest is deemed not fit for purchase, who tested this? This is not a RPG, it is an OK FPS, and I will probably continue to play if possible, (as long as somebody cleverer than me can publish the console commands), but I do grow weary at these poor console ports, we deserve better. A concern I do have is that the professional critics score the game so high, i can only assume the scores are based on what the game may become if the mod's are made to improve it, but as it is, 6 is a fair score, and a generous one at that, as actually there are too many game stopping bugs.

Bethesda looked for a way to basically lazily use their old **** and slap a bunch of content on it, then market it to sell.  It worked.  Per usual, Bethesda releases a relatively broken product.  The bugs were surprisingly minimal, but the overall mechanics and optimization were terrible.  After a while I've managed to fix most of the graphics and bugs, thanks to the mod community.  Does Bethesda even test play their own games anymore?  It's not a terrible game, but it's not near what it could have been.  They have continued to 'dumb down' the RPG elements of the game,  probably for the console audience.  As many have said, it's a decent good open world FPS.  I'm playing with a GTX 780 and with a few tweaks the game looks pretty good, although their artists used some really dumb colors that make the world look ugly.  Again, the game is broken on release,  it's the EXACT SAME ENGINE as Skyrim, so at least modders and .ini tweakers can fix some of the issues.

The thing is this, Fallout 4 is not a bad game, but Bethesda is clearly losing ground with their fanbase and making the wrong decisions in their games.I'm having flashbacks to when Dragon Age 2 released and the game was flooded with mixed reviews, many of them angry Bioware fans feeling betrayed by Bioware's design choices. But DA2 wasn't a bad game. It's the same thing with Fallout 4. The thing is this, Fallout 4 is not a bad game, but Bethesda is clearly losing ground with their fanbase and making the wrong decisions in their games. There has been a disturbing trend of Bethesda continually simplifying their games. This started with Oblivion and now it has made its way to Fallout.  Of course, theres a bit of hypocrisy here from many fans. Skyrim was certainly dumbed down, yet has stellar reviews and has not received the hatred that Fallout 4 has gotten. Its as if all of a sudden the Bethesda fanbase has woken up to the fact that Bethesda has been dumbing down their games.  But F4 is not a bad game. The 1 - 4 reviews are completely UNWARRANTED for this title.  Both the Fallout series and Elder Scrolls are known for deep, complex immersion RPG games where player choice is supposed to matter. If you want to be an evil **** you can. If you want to be a goody two shoes, you can as well. There used to be a choice and consequence system that is sorely absent in F4. Its either friendly factions or raiders. There is little in between - there are a few notable quests that give you some choices, but in general you are forced to be the good guy.  Bethesda has also once again simplified the character development process, instead of working on both SPECIAL perks and skills from F3, it has now just come down to just SPECIAL perks, and that's it - you also gain 10 HP when you level up. Wow. What happened Bethesda?  Clearly the time Bethesda spent on development was the crafting system. F4 features a deep crafting system. As you explore, you pick up ""junk"", (which actually isnt junk at all) and use those parts to craft things, like weapon mods and upgrades, and your power armor. But this is where it gets funky - theres too much focus on crafting. Eventually, you are almost forced to get a ""Settlement"" - an actual town, so to speak. And you craft it from the down up, we're talking power generators, light poles, walls - etc. The problem is that I dont really want to do this, and clearly theres been plenty of time devoted to this sort of thing. You play Fallout for survival and exploration, not building towns and cities.  It becomes extremely grindy, because you are constantly picking up junk and storing it. And it gets crazier, because you have other parameters, like town happiness, food, water - this is some complex stuff. Is this a town management game or Fallout 4? What was Bethesda thinking? If they added the complexity of town building to character development the game would have been much better off. Actually, yeah, ok, I see where they were going with this. But it doesn't work for F4.  Another gripe I have is the fact that there is a bit of a Borderlands feel to it. There is a focus on combat, a bit too much. There are legendary enemies which drop super items akin to Diablo and ARPG suffix's (Pistol of Wounding). These items have special effects which cannot be crafted but are always superior to crafted items. This is cool and all, but adds another element of GRIND. This is not really Fallout. If I want to play Borderlands, I will play Borderlands.  But F4 is NOT a bad game. Yeah, it has the typical Bethesda bugs - Bethesda is well known for their bugs and glitches, and F4 has plenty of them. But F4's combat system works beautifully. Its thoroughly enjoyable sniping that super mutant or smashing that hound to bits with my sledgehammer. F4's combat is extremely well done, and VATS makes it all the more fun! It was really, really fun exploring the South part of the map, where combat gets really hairy and requires you to stay on your toes. This is where F4 shines.  F4's musical score is excellent and probably the best out of series and possibly the best out of any Bethesda game. 10/10 for music.  Overall, F4 is disappointing, and just shows how too much hype can kill a game. I just wish Bethesda would have spent more money developing their game than making cool ads. The disturbing trend of Bethesda dumbing down their games continues. I dont see how they can do go any further, but they might just find a way in Fallout 5.

Whutupribs,"Nov 12, 2015",6," I have played this game extensively, having logged four days and thirteen hours on one character. I wanted to start this with the things the game has done well, I really did. However, the more I wrote, the more apparent it became that I wouldn't have room for the short paragraph of good things I wrote about Fallout 4, at least not if I wanted to include everything they did wrong. ThatI have played this game extensively, having logged four days and thirteen hours on one character. I wanted to start this with the things the game has done well, I really did. However, the more I wrote, the more apparent it became that I wouldn't have room for the short paragraph of good things I wrote about Fallout 4, at least not if I wanted to include everything they did wrong. That alone says a lot about the game. So while I wish I could have included a few positive things, these negative things will have to suffice... The biggest issue I had with the game was the gun/ armor crafting system. At first glance, it looks as though there's a hugely in-depth system for customizing your weapons and armor. From the very beginning, Bethesda toted their weapon mod system, and how you could spend hours just setting your weapon up exactly how you want it. However, after a short time in-game, you start to realize that the weapon mods are all very shallow, and that every weapon has a ""best possible setup"" that can only be reached by dumping points into the associated perk. Rather than having mods that might, say, increase the rate of fire but hurt accuracy, you've got all the top-tier mods that are better than everything else. You'll find yourself deciding to not even mod a weapon until you unlock the best rank in the ""Gun Nut"" perk, because its a waste of resources to do so. There are really very few actual weapons in the game, which after a while starts to make things extremely dull. One specific, yet major, issue that I noticed is that sniper rifles are completely non-existent in this game. Sure, you can craft one and slap all the appropriate mods on it, but it's still weaker than most other weapons in the game. Considering how many people enjoy playing stealth characters, I feel like this was an enormous oversight. Another major problem you'll run into is the armor system. If you care even a little bit about the way your character looks, this is going to drive you insane. Every last type of layered armor is ugly and bulky, and never seems to provide enough protection. Couple that with the fact that you can't wear armor on top of probably 75% of the clothes in the game, and you get a constant struggle of looks vs. utility. On top of that, the Legendary armor you come across never really seems to be worth using. If you want to use the layered armor, expect to spend most of the game in your vault suit. This may be subjective, but I hated the way they chose to use Power Armor in this game. You're constantly worrying about running out of fusion cores (which power the Power Armor), and they're extremely rare, so you find yourself leaving your Power Armor at your settlement so as to not waste battery. That, in turn, means you never have your Power Armor when you actually want it. The settlement system, though I think it was a good idea, is completely broken. Its extremely difficult to build anything that looks halfway decent, and you find yourself building a lot of boxes and prefabs just because it's such a colossal pain to build anything the way you want it. It's almost as if the settlement system was left in alpha, like it was something they forgot about until the very last minute and then hurried to make usable. It could have been fun, intuitive and useful, but instead it is annoying, frustrating and unimportant. And god forbid you have more than one or two settlements, because you'll constantly be under attack. Every single time I've ""waited"" in the game, even if it was only for an hour or two, I failed at least one ""help defend (insert settlement)"" quest. Take that along with the fact that the settlements are unimportant and that there's no lasting consequences for letting one get wiped out, and it becomes more of an annoyance than anything. Of course, the dialogue system and the overall lack of a compelling story have been discussed extensively. The voice-acted dialogue breaks immersion pretty severely, or at least it did for me, and you never really actually have a choice. Dialogue is more or less just choosing how you say ""yes"". There's no karma or fame system, no lasting consequences for your choices, there are no medicine/repair/science/charisma-type dialogue checks (which makes the whole per system feel dumbed-down and unimportant), no real faction loyalty aside from the single point in the game where you get to choose who to align with. The story is bland and expects you to feel an emotional connection to your son and wife, even though you only spend a grand total of about 15 minutes with them. The fact that your backstory is forced breaks immersion as well. Long gone is the ""lone wanderer"" feeling, the ability to project yourself unto your character. There is definitely a lot more that can be said about the game, but I'm running out of space. This game is chock-full of great ideas that are only half-executed. You will get some enjoyment out of it, but it's not the Fallout game we had been waiting for.… Expand "

The game has a very short main story if you focus on that , and the writing is decent at best. The action is more streamlined then in the prior games , even tho they just facilitated things that mods already did for New Vegas like sprinting.  Base Building Game: It is VEERRYY limited , with no tools for teramorphing or angling buildings. The buildings have no physics , making a lot of funky looking houses that float or are held up by a staircase. The Settlement Build Limit is a very bad idea. While yea , putting something like that for defensive buildings might have helped in making the game more challenging with the settlement invasions , it has no reason to exist for things like walls or resource buildings. I litteraly built nothing in sanctuary apart from the Sturges starting mission and wanted to make the Starlight Drive In my big base. I hoarded 13000 steel and 8000 wood , and when i was 40% done i couldn't build anymore , even tho i had no uttilities in place , just the walls and that infuriated me and i had to search the internet for a cheat for their design flaw, as mats are not that easy to come by and you have to ferry everything back to base after each mission. Houses look like they're made out of squares , it feels like building with some cheap lego knockoff . Also , the ammount of settlements is to high , but hey , thats bethesda for you , QUANTITY/QUALITY.  Weapon Modding System : even tho it was advertised as "" There are over (insert high number for dramatic effect and getting the hopes up for people that enjoy costumizable weapons) diffrent combinations"" , but you will wave only 1-2 valid options that trump the others outright.  For instance , i bought a Legendary Sword for 3.2K caps , went back to the work station to mod it and all i could do was +20 normal damage , +11 Energy Damage or +20 Normal Damage AND +11 Energy Damage. Now , 90% of the players will decide on a build and will pick the perk that allows them to mod their weapons of choice , so the other 2 were obsolete from the get go. Also , the enchantments on Legendary items and the modding of armors are bland , doing **** all to enhance the experience.  Character Building: I don't enjoy that much the new perk system , allowing you to purchase special points , making all around builds better for the content at hand. I played 3 diffrent builds thus far. First one was a Stealth-Sniper build , that , while one shoting most common and named enemies , struggled against bosses , a stealth headshot doing 40-60% of their HP , vats taking way to much AP to be a viable hit and run strat and unzoomed shots would't be precise at all , leading to me waisting 1-2 magazine to down a boss. Now , i did invest in a decent revolver and the agility perk to make my build more viable , but still , one bad step and i was gone. Second build was a melee oriented guy , very ressistant and strong atacks.This was better , but towards the mid to late part of the game , the ammount of enemies out of reach forced me to get a long range weapon that did close to no damage. Third build was an all rounder luck build. I survived amazingly well , damage was up there , AP was insane and the OP luck tree worked like a charm , keeping me at Full AP , one shoting enemies , 1 crit every 2-3 shots that did 3.5 times the damage if i remember correctly.  All in all , it is a hyped unfinished product that i wouldn't have payed anything over 30$ if i didn't knew there was an avid modding community turning this thing around. Bang for the buck its fine at 60$ with the amount of content if you go for the completionist route , but if you just build a bit your settlement , focus on the main quest and a few side missions it wont take you more then 20 hours of gametime , but even if you go for completionist , the quests are so empty that you will get bored before doing all of them.  I highly recommed buying this game in 3-4 months when big mods hit the nexus , as for now , if you have what to play , don't waiste your money here… Expand "

Quest are bugged, ""restart the game, duh!""  At this day and age, I just don't find these things acceptable anymore. Bethesda might say they are a small company, but it's  because they refuse to hire more permanent employees. This company is taking it millions but refuses to do extra testing; as they said, bug testing does not come close to their millions of consumer testing the game out.  Is this the only issue? no!. The game has radiant(infinite) quest that actually punish you for not doing them. You can't ignore them either, it has a secret timer, so when it's nearly out of time, it will warn you. Do it, or you will pay. Settlement building was a nice addition...EXCEPT they rushed it. There is really no reason to actually develop your settlements, but again these things are forced on you. You can choose to ignore them but you still get those messages. Lets not forget how they managed to make a fallout game about rebuilding the world that doesn't give you an incentive to do it  At it's base, the game is fine. It has nice crafting/modding, it's a good shooter, and it's fun to explore. When you dig deeper, even these things are an issue. Crafting/modding is progressive; it offers and illusion of choice. Would you upgrade the armor you are wearing with 50 more armor point or 75? Clearly, it's 75! yet you feel like there are a lot of choice, but in fact there is a clear choice and the idiotic choice. Weapons too! You can get the short barrel or advanced short barrel. Guess which is better? Is there a long barrel? Of course, but you wont be putting that on your 10 mm pistol, right? Are you going ti put long range scope on your shot gun? No! Clearly it's meant to make players feel like there is an illusion of choice  In fact, the game is filled with these fake choices. There is a path and it will end a specific way regardless of what dialogue option you choose. There is a choice to explore however you want but the game makes it clear to stay in a particular place because it's gated by levels. It's good, it's linear but that illusion is always there.  The main story has a nostalgic feeling. You get out of the vault and you must find X person. Does it ring a bell? It should! It's identical to fallout 3. The game definitely feels like fallout 3. It doesn't establish anything new. This is not to say a sequel should not be similar to it's predecessor, but when it's too similar there is a clear problem.

RM8,"Nov 24, 2015",1," Fallout 4 is such a bad game, like really bad. BGS has become a dev with poor design decisions.  Witcher 3's quests have meaningful choices and consequences, the removal of armor & weapons breaking is dumb CDPR added it in Witcher 3 while BGS has it kept removed since Skyrim. Go figure.

Kept it gender neutral and classic Fallout at the same time.  Why they didn't I cannot quite fathom.  Then they put us in half-by-half pre-made characters - married with kids.  No longer a blank canvas for you to paint on, but either a war veteran if you pick the guy or a lawyer if you pick the gal (thought he gets the intro video, she, uh, indeed, a diploma).  Why not both veterans?  Or neither?  Or better still, a different story altogether that didn't try to force you into the roles they made for you, or half made.  Being born to 'random' parents is one thing (Fallout 3 and even previous games) is one thing, being given a spouse and kid another.  Dialogue wheel, oh how I detest thee.  It is like a guessing game what your character will say at times.  Voice acting is doing this and will do so until it can be replaced with natural sound synthetic voices (synths, ha, yeah...) that can express (user controlled) emotions.  As it stands now, it constantly sandbags you in addition to severely limiting the number of options open to you (after all, can't record dialogue for another three years just to add one more option to each encounter, and how would it work on a controllers directional pad any way?).  Voice acting has, since it entered the RPG genre, served to limit the options in dialogue, even when it was 'only' used for NPCs.  RPG sandboxes are not the best genre for it, whereas it works fine in games with a non-sandbox world and a completely pre-set character (by-the-rail-shooters, for instance).  Personally I cannot wait for 'alternative start' mods to come in.  Start as a single neighbour of this couple, or live somewhere else (a few other Vaults out there, after all), giving us this blank canvas again.  Or even as a ghoul, for those interested in that, perhaps trapped for 200 years (it happens, you know)?  But most of all, a mod that turns the wheel into a list with the full dialogue text displayed.  That alone would have made me rank this eight (8) instead.  The artificial 'care-for-me' scenario and shoe-horning into a role that not all may enjoy or desire cost it two stars.  The third is lost due to the obvious concession to controller support with half-hearted keyboard+mouse alternative seeming tacked on - and even lacking in clear controls at time (such as scrolling on the mouse doesn't show more text on the terminals, but rather the unannounced Enter key).  Bizarre feeling to it, and overly large text for a computer screen.  Again, mods will fix it, in time, but it is sad to see this haunt nearly all games these days.  Also wish I could assign more keys for functions so the did not share the same.  Support keyboards properly, please.  It is also a bit jarring to step out of the vault and turn from grieving to mass killing literally within minutes, yet later in the game you can feel sorrow over killing a mid-level henchman, albeit briefly.  Yes, it's Fallout, fighting is part of it, but it is poorly paced and feels jarring.  Like all those films where the 'hero' kills countless 'goons' and refuses to kill the Main Bad because 'there's been enough killing'.  I say.  I have not had many bugs, I must say, apart from once when I had to reload a save (save often, make it a habit, not just because of potential bugs) - mostly my bugs have been hilarious air-born bodies upon death and other harmless ones (shot a raider in the head, he launched straight up for, oh, 100 metres or so).  I came prepared for worse, but I might have gotten lucky.  Graphics are fine.  It does not strive to be ultra-realistic but to have its own style.  It achieves that.  What is clumsy are some facial animations, mostly.  All this said, I enjoy it and will probably keep playing for a long time (I still play Skyrim, with maxed out number of mods), I just hope Bethesda reverts back to the blank canvas and proper RPG dialogue interface.  I recommend it, with these reservations in mind.… Expand "

This is a low score 'cause for now, the game desearves it.  For the ones wanting simple pros and cons, there it goes:  Pros: - Locations are awesome, many of them having Quests or story on their own. They really managed to give life to this scorched Boston. - Light is the best I've seen in any game (including The Witcher 3) - It's a Fallout game. Live, explore, Kill/talk, get paid is rarelly a mix that fails. - Settlement system, once you have access to abundant materials, is really fun. - Some characters are really, REALLY interesting. - Map is so full you can't walk a straight line for 1 minute without finding something (even things not marked, Like the Bartender on the west end of the map) - Power Armor was boring to some people, to me it's like something I use when I prepare for some more difficult quests, and it REALLY makes all the difference (Like potions on The Witcher and Dragon Age series). - The modding system on Weapons is really awesome and creates character for every piece you buld. - Dogmeat. - There's a sattelite storm once in a while (like the one from Gravity movie - Look at the sky at night when not clouded) - Even with the low graphics, the game is beautiful. - Probably the best ambient soundtrack on any Fallout game.  Cons  - GTX 900 series owners: This game is your random fps drop nightmare. For bethesda, our GPU power souldn't give us better performance. - Remember I've said some character are really interesting? Well, the 4 choices dialogues NEVER lets you really dig on those layers not previouws games had. - Characters animations, except for some more important characters, sometimes seems worse than Skyrim (and sometimes worse than Fallout 3. - Hoarding everything gets boring really fast. And since you depend of it for 2 core mechanics of the game, you HAVE to deal with it. - Some enemies act as if they've came straight out of Fallout 3 (Supermutants, I'm looking at you). - Extremely boring loadscreens after some events of the game (Roof of the buldings for those who played the game already). - It's a Fallout game. JUST a Fallout game. Everything added to it feels like a mod. The settlements, the modding of guns, even the Power Armor. The new things are cool, but I often cought myself wandering how all of those things look like some early access to a mod. Not cool for a far from cheap game. - You'll see lots of bugs. LOTS. Not even on Skyrim I've got so many. Some are easy to ignore (being an oldschool Fallout and Bethesda fan), but some are completely dealbreakers: Cows walking on a road to the sky, companion vanishing, enemies stuck everywhere. - Quests often feel like the same of the same of the same: Go there, Kill, Get, Come Back. Ok when they are well scripted, not ok when you scripting doesn't compels you to do them. - Quests are really short. I wanted to just throw myself into them, but they are like a shot of tequila when what you want is a very degustating bottle of wine (Or 8 bottles of Sunset Sarsparilla). - For now I'm staying away from the main quest: I can feel it's going to be, like many others really short. - The modding system on ARMOR could have been beautifull and authentic. It's just ok. - As a PC gamer, I feel really betrayed for having more comfort playing this with my XBox controller. Poorly optimized interface (The previous games where not that bad now, hun?) and AWFUL mouse optimization. - The game feels flat: everything, every place seems to be resolved really, really lightspeed fast, and I have ADHD, things can get boring very often, but this game fails on making me feel like deep on that specific quest. The Frying Pan quest on The Witcher 3 or the Disarming Megaton Bomb in Fallout 3 felt deeper than any quest I've made so far. - Except for Charisma, none of your traits have ANY impact on conversations. I feel like I'm just playing a 'yes/no' game on reciving quests. No deeper relevance for any NPC. - Some quests seems to solve themselves, even really cool ones (U.S.S Congretional quest, for exemple). - It was cool when 'that fallout tune' played for the first times , but the really should put on new songs. Felt like a copy/paste of prewious Fallout games with some few additions. - Underwater Armor: BAD IDEA.  Please note that I'm liking the game, the dealbreaker here is performance. How can my naighbour get 60pfs on a lower end PC than mine? On every aspect I suprassed the reccomended requirements, but a GTX 770 with a I5 runs better than a GTX 970 with I7. Bethesda AND NVidia are guilty here, and I'm not recomending the game to ANYONE until those things are corrected.… Expand "

lonewolfevo,"Nov 25, 2015",6,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Well guys this is Fallout 4...  I really hope bethesda gets around to reading these reviews because this is a video game franchise fans are vet passionate about.  MY OPINION I think people are a little too mad about what this game ended up being I myself am not mad I'm just disappointed as a long time fallout fan I have to be honest with myself as a fan and as a gamer that I feel like fallout fell short of what I have come to expect from a bethesda game. Also I don't understand all the complaining about the graphics bethesda games have never been known for their graphics but the extreme death of the frame rate upon entering a city is unacceptable.  GAMEPLAY Here I feel like bethesda took a few steps forward but not in a good way. The gunplay is a vast improvement from what it used to be and is extremely addictive but I feel like that is the only thing keeping me playing the game and the fact that its fallout. The rpg elements of the game are really dumbed down the new leveling system isn't really anything to be impressed about but I appreciate the fact that there is no level cap. The new dialogue wheel didn't really keep me immersed into the experience of anything it hurt it. I didn't have a real sense of self in my character it kinda felt like I was just along for the ride. Also on you couldn't really tell the chances of successfully persuading anyone. There's also not a whole lot of weapons in the game you just happen to come across different variations of the few weapons that are available buy I do like that the weapons nodding allows you to make it your own. That goes for power armor as well even though there are oly 4 sets of power armor to choose from. I think the power armor was done right this time around though it really makes you feel well... powerful. I don't like the fact that there are now no requirements to get power armor you can literally get power armor 5 minutes into the game, and the fusion core thing is very limiting I'm not a scientist but I know that nuclear fusion would generate enough power for more than 15 minutes of use. The armor layering is also very vague I would find I set of armor and wouldn't be able to layer it like other outfits even though looks lt be able to accept layering the drifter suit is a perfect example. The town build was also very underwhelming after I would establish a settlement I found myself never feeling attached like the settlement truly needed me to survive. There building of settlements is often very finicky as well. There is alsoa total absence of the repair system which was the only thing that kept me hoarding gun and making them feel valuable breaking weapons down for parts for the most part felt like a waste of time so the basic just ended up being junk because of my custom weapons I never really needed the other ones. The legendary enemy's also felt very cheap I would be waking around and find I legendary enemy's and never really feel threatened. I could probably think of more things to cover but I better move on. Also the fact that there were only like 3 unique weapons in the game made me lose interest in exploring.  STORY I could go on all day about the story's short comings but it would be better just to sum it up. The story felt totally underwhelming and re-used. Never did I really feel attached to any of the characters nor did my choic es feel like they had any effect on the world around me. There is a no longer a karma system of a faction system when you join a faction you feel like are just there and not a part of it.  SUMMARY Fallout 4 no longer feels like the game I had expected it to be or what I hoped it would it fell extremely short from expectations. I expect better from bethesda hell we as a fan base expect more from bethesda. I love fallout 4 because it's fallout 4 but I'm afraid that that's the only reason I love it... At some point as a fan you just have to be honest with yourself was the game worth your well earned money that's a question you need to ask yourself. I think my money was well spent ONLY because I'm a long time fallout fan. The best I can give this game is a 6/10... Slightly above average... We all should have hight expectations from triple A game studios and triple A games like this I don't hate fallout 4 I'm just disappointed in bethesda for not delivering a Vetter product...… Expand "

Power armor feels like power armor in other fallout games it’s just another set of armor in no way special and requiring more to wear but not always being better, in FO4 it has great benefits and feels like heavy power armor. 2.	Shooting, in other fallouts you almost have to use VATS half the game because shooting controls are subpar, this has been greatly improved upon, I personally only used vats for spotting since enemies don’t show up on the compass at range like they used to. 3.	Every piece of scrap matters, you can turn almost anything into gear making it a real post apocalyptic game where you learn to turn fallen trees into houses and soda cans into submachine guns were as other fallout would have you collect lots of items you would never have a use for. 4.	Receive some benefit from your factions (except useless railroad), flares and mortars from minutemen, vertibirds from BOS, synth grenades from institute, although to be fair to the railroad the vertibirds aren’t very useful ether.  That’s about it so on to everything I personally found wanting 1.	Boring, this game simply fails to engage on any level, it starts with a strong open someone killing your wife and stealing the baby your wife stole from home economics class that you call your son and thus ends your interest in the game, from that point forward it somehow fails to interest you in anything that happens for the rest of the game, the only other fun or exciting thing that happens is in the very next town you visit, it doesn’t seem possible to do this but…yeah it’s just boring. 2.	Pointless, part of the reason people love fallout is the freedom, want to wander off in the wrong direction and help some guy with his math homework instead of saving the world, or **** the world nuke that **** again, that’s fine go ahead be the bad guy, not fallout 4 not matter what you do it pushes you toward the same goals, short of killing everyone you meet there’s nothing you can do to make anyone thing you’re not the hero and I’m not even sure that would work this makes almost all the choices you make in the game pointless but then lacking the detailed story of JRPG’s to make up for the lack of choice. 3.	Cardboard people, in other fallout game you feel the lives of the npc’s they feel like they matter they all have tons of back story most are involved in multiple quests, in fallout 4 that don’t even feel like zombies, they lack the personality to make it even that far, reducing my interest in them to less than zero. 4.	Settlements, it feels like most of the game was scraped for this feature and it’s not even that good, most of the most  interesting places in the game are not  connected to it at  all and the bulk of places you can build are places that suck. Add to that the insanely low build cap which seems to be a limitation of the old engine the game is based on that quite frankly can barely handle this game I don’t care about graphics or stuff like that but the game is so over burdened its barely functional. 5.	Companions also pointless, they can’t fight, only two can hide at all, they spend most of the time getting you spotted and lying on the ground, they have almost no background and don’t feel like people, they feel like equipment, the useless kind you junk. 6.	Weapon customization is a good idea but the last option on every menu is basically the best choice every time so there is no point picking anything else. In closing it’s not really an rpg at all anymore and not a very interesting FPS so there’s really nothing it has to offer if you get it on sale check it out otherwise don’t bother, it’s not a terrible game but it’s not worth the full sale price.… Expand "

А мимика вообще ужасная. Музыкальное сопровождение не изменилось практически со времен 3 части. Много песен мы слышали в ней. Поэтому лучше не стало. Диалоги нам обещали улучшить, вариативности в них добавить и персонаж говорящим сделать. Но лично я не вижу в этой части улучшений, а только хуже. Вариативность в диалогах условная. По сути всё сводится к 4 вариантам. Один из которых практически завершает диалог. Строчка сарказм в диалоге лично у меня смеха не вызывает. Уж больно всё примитивно. С учётом, что дублежа русского нет, а строки диалогов в субтитрах не все переведены или не всегда корректно, своевременно отображаются, то людям плохо владеющим английским многое будет не понятно. Я считаю, это вообще не уважение к русскоговорящим геймерам. Сделали перевод на ""отвали"", для галочки. Теперь о главном, о сюжете. Он как таковой глубокий отсутствует. Задумка может быть была. Да вот воплощение её подвело. А может быть и не было её вовсе. Так всё поверхностно. Хотя начало было интригующим. А вот дальше... Сюжет теряется в череде второстепенных заданий, в большинстве своём однообразных, однотипных. По сути, влияния игрока на сюжет нет. Нет в нём таких трогательных, волнующих, ключевых, стержневых моментов, в которых проявляется влияние игрока, в которых игрок участвует, которые заставляют задуматься, волноваться или испытывать иные эмоции. Всё как-то ровно. Системы отношений с спутниками или иными НПС нет. И еще, от сюжета сильно отвлекает боевая система. Она безусловно стала лучше. И это плюс и минус игры. Быть может, разработчики упор основной сделали именно на боевую составляющую, а про сюжет, ролевую составляющую забыли. Про разные баги, глюки не буду писать. Их поправят, думаю.

Overall it is fun to play and pretty much revives that Fallout 3 experiences we all have been waiting for! But is it enough just to create another clone - or should Bethesda have aimed for more?  Lets begin with the positive aspects.  ++ World and setting: I simply love the wasteland. Bethesda did - as expected - a great job at creating a beautiful world to explore, with a lot of humor and an interesting retro-futuristic-50ish look. The feature of being able to build settlements and own houses ingame may be a small one, but it really adds an aspect most Fallout 3 and Elder Scrolls fans have been waiting for, even if they weren't aware of that, at that point. In skyrim, the first Mods I downloaded and loved using were player abodes - now I can create as I see fit. Good Job, poorly introduced though, but good job nevertheless. ++ the perk system: In my opinion the new perk system is great. It is intuitive, easy to understand and adds a great level to role playing. Being able to increase stats is a nice thing as well + it may be a small thing, but Bethesda thought of it: you are able to change your face and hair ingame. And not just after a year of complains, fifty mods and five add ons, but right in the vanilla game. Its a small feature, but it shows Bethesda learned form experience, at least in that regard. + the VATS: is now moving in slow-mo. Some hate it. I like it. It forces you to make a decision and adds just a small degree of difficulty, in my eyes well done. + your character finally looks decent, the editor allows for handsome faces - well done. + the gunplay has been improved, it feels more natural now, not bad  But now to the reasons, why this game is not  a 10/10. - - The depth of story and the characters We are writing the year 2015. Had this game been released in 2013 the way it is, it would have been an 8. But now I have seen Dragon Age III. I have seen the Witcher III - I have seen how well a Role Play Game can bring life and depth to characters. Fallout 4 is missing that. The faces still look expressionless and the NPCs move around like puppets. Yes they have a few more animations, but still. That was okay when Skyrim was released, as it was the state of the art. But no more. And also the depth of the characters. Fallout 4 creates one dimensional characters, the story is predictable. Bringing life to characters is not a thing that requires modern game engines or graphics, it is a matter of planning and writing. Dragon Age III has done a superb job of that, it provided me with companions and characters I cared about. Baldurs Gate, Pillars of Eternity, the Witcher - there are many examples to show that Storytelling can be a thing that makes a game great. Here Bethesda failed as it relies mostly on its open world, neglecting a well written storytelling. - - Character Identification: Bethesda games like the Elder Scrolls Series or Fallout 3 always relied on the players imagination of how they see themselves in the game. Am I a ruthless rogue or a noble paladin, a savior or a villain that just helps for his own gain? In Fallout 4 this choice is taken from you as you are pressed into the corset of a Father/Mother seeking his/her son. During the main campaign all of a sudden you can only watch your player from a third perspective and think - wait - thats not me, who is this guy and what is he doing to my character. This discrepancy between ""I see myself as that kind of character"" and ""what on earth is my character saying there, I wouldn't act like that"" really bugged me. - the dialogue options: are now reduced to four answers that aren't even spelled out. So you just pick one of the few answers the game offers and watch what happens, for most of the time you don't know what that answer really is supposed to mean: Spoiler: ""maybe"" usually means ""no"" - - - - - The Interface I can't put enough Minus marks on that. This game certainly doesn't deserve a below 5 rating, but I can see, why people are tempted to give one. The interface, especially on PC is simply put: CRAP. I can see why the programmers liked that pip-boy-green-on-black-look - but it's useless. Bethesda - look at the Number one most downloaded mod for Skyrim: it is a mod for a new UI. Any idea why that is??? You obviously don't. The lists are annoying and don't do the game justice. ------ hard coded keybindings Also: I have to write it again, since I don't feel the developers have realized that fully: We are writing the year 2015. Why on earth didn't bethesda foresee players using esdf instead of that ridiculous was. (There is a reason why the ""F"" is always marked on a Keyboard!). The secondary bindings cannot be changed thus creating a mess once you change the primary ones. poor job. Not being able to control and maneuver as I wish really dampens the game experience A LOT and makes it feel like a flight simulator at times.… Expand "

Most of this play time has been spent doing the first handful of quests and generally wandering around on a high end PC with graphics set to ultra. FPS maxed out at 60 and it's lowest drop was 54.  Fallout 4 from Bethesda strikes out slightly from what people are used to in their Fallout games, the graphics in comparison to previous games are clearly a large leap. Compared to other similar games however it is is left wanting, but only by a small margin. The game itself has seemed to take a considerable step back from the RPG element in favor of a more action based theme, thrusting you into a a big confrontation early on.  On personal taste, this could either be a good thing or a bad thing, and as someone that has played Fallout 3, New Vegas, Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 this felt rather jarring. the fighting, whilst slightly more difficult than before, is messy and far from perfect though exciting. The movement feels almost a little too smooth, as if sliding rather than walking and the view point, though have I have yet to change it, feels condensed.  That's not to say that the game doesn't have it's positives. Fights are, again, exciting and each kill feels earned, the game looks far better when compared to previous games, the atmosphere can be effective and exploration is, as to be expected, rewarding. As I mentioned, this is an early review so perhaps there will be more to the RPG and story elements as I continue.  Nit picking, I dislike the four options in conversations, the list of options has always worked well and there was no need to change that. The early burst of action feels like it is going to prep the rest of the game for failure, especially, and spoilers ahead, gifting us the power armour and springing the Deathclaw on us so soon with no real warning. On top of that, the crafting system, whilst promising, made me sigh at the list of items required because now I know I'm going to have to scratch through the dirt to find the right amount of wonderglue. On top of that, the perk system feels dull when compared to previous games as well as being able to specialize and build the exact character you want with skill point placements.  All in all Fallout 4 is fun but falls short of being great. I have been luckily spared the technical issues that have plaqued many others thus far but that is not a positive, every game now days should be released without major flaws like that and developers should not be congratulated on releasing a game that is not a buggy mess. Fallout 4 is a fun action game but a good RPG it is not and that is a real shame when considering that has been it's main appeal.  In trying to give us more bang for our buck Bethesda have gutted Fallout 4 of what a this series of games has always gotten by on the most. Its soul.

While there are some great additions, the crafting system, improved combat, building etc. It's one step forward, FIVE steps back. The poor performance on all platforms, optimization and bugs are almost game breaking. The main story is extremely uninspired, and is almost a carbon copy of the story of Fallout 3, with a few minor tweaks. The voice acting and writing is extremely poor, for example the Boston accents sound like they were done from people off the street. For SEVEN years of development time, and with so many marks missed, I would not recommend this game, as anyone who has any respect for the RPGs of the past will be sorely disappointed with this.… Expand "

Customization on your weapons is a token gesture and a half hearted one at that. There is no love to the environment as in previous games and the dark humor carefully crafted into the world previously is also strangely absent. Hardly any optimization for the PC. This was very clearly created for the consoles and then dumped on a PC market. The settlement gimmick... Oh my god the settlements... when did fallout become the **** sims? I could go on for hours.

In every dialog you have about 4 options (4? how convenient..) and no matter how related or not related these options are, you can pick only one and that's it - dialog is over. No additional questions regarding your choices, not additional options based on your charisma or intelligence or strenght, nothing at all. You either say to that stupid robot that your wife's dead or ask him whether he saw killers - no option to tell him the bad news and ask about killer afterwards. I was like what??

My feelings toward FO4 went up and down. I found it rather boring in the beginning but it became much better after a few hours. But still…  Sure, the world is huge, there is a lot to explore, and it is fun roaming around, but the world somehow doesn’t attract me like in the previous games FO3/NV. Bethesda made some improvements here and there, like the fantastic crafting system, I even like the graphics, but still I felt more related to game world in all of the past titles.  I miss interesting quests, exciting stories and noteworthy characters. There are too many dead places in the world with no story or where the story hardly scratches the surface. Compared to its predecessors, the game makes a lot of things different. But I miss improvements in the important areas. I gladly would have traded the “base building” for a real big and interesting city. I would have liked more “Roleplay Game” instead of “Minecraft”.  FO4 doesn’t live up to my expectations and I must admit that I like FO3/NV more than this one. But the most important thing at last. It is one thing to compare this game to its predecessors but time went on and brought us a game like “The Witcher 3” from CDP which set the new benchmark in terms of open world RPGs. CDP showed that it is indeed possible to combine an open world with an interesting main story, complex side quests and fill it with hundreds of little stories all around. They showed that you can create remarkable characters who grow dear to one’s heart and become friends rather than being simple quest giver. They showed that you can have complex interaction with the world and its inhabitants rather than rushing trough. And they managed to create a game world that feels real and alive. It makes you feel like it could be existing whereas FO4 totally feels… yeah, like a game.  Bethesda said prior to the release of FO4 that the game would “set new standards in terms of open world RPGs”. I can only say, sorry but these new standards have already been set by CDP and their Witcher 3. And FO4 is far away from this new open world RPG experience.… Expand "

If anything, FO4 shows us how lazy Bethesda games have become. It lacks the spark that’ll keep gamers coming back.  I enjoyed Fallout 3. It sucks players in with a great intro and then throws them to the wolves. There is so much uncertainty after those beginning moments. Fallout 4 dumbed it all down. Everything is sped up so to keep the attention of impatient tween gamers. I actually had a laugh out loud moment just before my character stepped out of the vault. The sense of awe Bethesda captured with FO3, Oblivion, and Morrowind simply isn’t there. Even Skyrim does a great job instilling a feeling of adventure into axe wielding drifters. Fallout 4 never does that, which is sad given the protagonist’s dilemma.  The optional companions are hindrances more than aids. Stealth players are better leaving them at home. Companions possess no situational awareness. They walk into ambushes, give aware hidden positions, and pin players against obstacles. Managing them is a pain because there’s no quick menu for issuing commands. Players must actually look at companions, mark them, and then direct them exactly where to go. They habitually ignore orders, or get lost. There are no indicators on the minimap for companions’ locations. If players want to find someone, good luck. I only keep companions around to hold loot.  Companions don’t contribute to the story either. Unlike Mass Effect, the actions of one companion have no influence on another’s behavior. Dialogue options don’t reflect previous decisions. Conversations are shallow. For completionist, the romance options and companion perks are added benefits. It only takes an hour or two to max a companions affinity meter. Unlike well-constructed RPG’s, FO4 doesn’t emphasize loyalty among companions. I guess that’s a good thing since they suck anyway. Overall, companions are hardly beneficial.  Like every other Bethesda game, the engine is a wreck. Low framerates, texture pop ins, clipping issues, and long load times are just a few problems. Save often. My character has gotten stuck in midair, fallen thru map, and walked thru all the buildings of Boston Commons. These problems forced me to quit the game and reload. Now I save every few minutes. Bethesda is notorious for releasing buggy games, and FO4 is no exception. Despite using a speedy ssd, load times are slow when entering buildings and dungeons. Character interactions are sometimes delayed as dialogue is loaded. Witcher 3 has its share of problems, but it sets a high bar on performance. No loading screens and impressive frame rates create a seamless, immersive experience, something Bethesda should imitate.  Graphically, FO4 is unimpressive. Visually, Dying Light on Xbox One blows the PC version of FO4 out of the water. Perch on a skyscraper in each game and the differences are obvious. The Creation engine is unsophisticated and poorly optimized. The problems listed above are bad enough. But it’s also plagued by slow rendering, short draw distances, and muddy textures. Just inferior performance overall. Skyrim has several game breaking bugs that Bethesda refuses to fix, and the same will happen with Fallout 4.  The VATS system is back, but feels less important now. The SPECIAL attributes are nifty, but unbalanced. Except for Strength and Endurance, attributes primarily benefit VATS users. Charisma requires a hefty investment to be useful. Players must pump 8 points into it if they want to pass speech check or build settlements. Agility and Perception offer no benefits in real time combat. Bethesda offsets the less than stellar attributes by binding them with perks. No skills this time. On low difficulties, perks aren’t even necessary. Unfortunately, sneaky players will have the most difficult times because stealth mechanics are crap, as usual. Boss fights take a page from Dues Ex: HR. They cater to specific playstyles, namely brute force or heavy VATS usage. Other builds are at disadvantages.  Settlements require valuable upgrade points but offer debatable benefits. They aren’t necessary. FO4 provides zero information in game on building them. The mechanics are cobbled together, so constructing anything from scratch is painstakingly difficult. At best, it’s a shoddy level creator tacked on just before launch.  Fallout 4 isn’t a bad game. But it feels dated and clumsy. The thin story, shallow characters, and average gameplay remind me of Far Cry games. All the RPGness is gone. Terrible optimization is par for the course. Bethesda is cruising on autopilot and Fallout 4 confirms this. If you’ve played one Bethesda’s game, you’ve played them all. Hopefully its next release offers real innovation instead of pandering to casual kids.… Expand "

The settlements seem very fun at first, but then you realize that they don't get attacked if you have a good defensive score, so then what exactly is the point? I'm not really sure to be honest. I built stores but they don't seem to be making me any money, so I'm a bit confused on what the point of settlements are at all. They don't give you money, and they don't get attacked. After you get bored of building; which admittedly was fun for a while, the whole settlement mechanic just seems pointless. Also Building on slopes is a downright painful.  The game was definitely designed around the power armor and its a major improvement compared to other fallout games, but once you start finding or buying a lot of fusion cores which power the armor, it seems like you're in a constant state of overpowered mode. My companion is even able to use a 2nd power armor suit that I found, without a fusion core lol. I pulled the core and told them to go inside it and they have no problem running around and fighting in it when it has no fusion core. Nice one bethesda.  There isn't really any ""survival"" aspect to ""survival"". Unlike hardcore mode in fallout new vegas, you don't have any food/health or sleep needs. In my opinion Bethesda dropped the ball on that. That was a great improvement that new vegas added to the series and I really don't know why that isn't in fallout 4. I expect mods to fix a lot of the issues with food/water/sleep needs and the settlement issues.  Shooting has been vastly improved from the previous fallout games which is a major bonus, and I think a lot of people are saying that this isn't an RPG anymore because you don't need v.a.t.s to play this game now. You have way more options when it comes to perks and building a character compared to previous fallout games, and your character is actually voiced which I found an improvement over the previous fallout games as well. I haven't gone to deep into the  story yet but so far side-quests have been highly entertaining. The way they made ghouls crawl from random places in the environment is also a major improvement.  The graphics aren't as bad as people are saying. Yes, textures can be low-res at times but I expect beth may do a high-res pack as they did for skyrim. If not, mods will solve those problems over time.  I really don't understand all this hate. This game IS a vast improvement over new vegas and fallout 3. The only thing it didn't get right was the actual survival aspect of the food/water/sleep needs which isn't THAT big of a deal. The only thing they really messed up on here are settlements. They don't get attacked which is just boring and they aren't making me money so I don't understand what purpose they have, you don't have any escort caravan type missions either when you make supply lines between the settlements so I really don't understand why something like that isn't there either. I would have gave the game an 8 but these settlements just don't make sense to me so I gave it a 7.  It's a solid game. It has some problems and issues that may get resolved with mods or with patches from bethesda. It doesn't deserve this level of hate though that I've been seeing.… Expand "

First off what the game gets right - Shooting/combat, FO4 is light years better than NV or FO3 in this regard. HOWEVER, Fallout games have never been primarily FPS arcade shooter; Bethesda **** the bed on any RPG-like aspects of the game. Everything else is sadly pretty much a disappointment.  First off: Optimization. I play skryim with a TON of mods, and it still gets a smooth 60fps and it looks nicer than fallout 4. Why the constant dipping between 30 and 60? My PC plays pretty much any other game, including witcher 3, on ultra with 60fps.  Secondly - The controls are AWFUL. I gave up and resorted to playing with an xbox controller, as the PC controls were simply too awkward and clunky. This should not be happening with any game, period. Especially a RPG.  Thirdly - The gameplay. Please give Fallout back to Obsidian. The perk system / leveling up is more call of duty than fallout in nature, what was a fantastic system has been heavily reduced to this oversimplified, scape-goat of a leveling system. Voice acting, while heavily hyped by media, turned out (surprise surprise) to be a huge negative. Immersion is wrecked, and the dialogue choices are seriously **** pathetic. You're answers for pretty much everything is **** ""please, tell me more"" ""yes"" or ""no."" That along with a voiced protagonist more or less kills any immersion. In Fallout NV and Fallout 3, a lot of people, myself included, liked the role playing aspect. I would play first as a cowboy with a heart of gold, then replay as a savage heavy artillery warlord. Fallout 4 removed any aspect of this, and replaced it with... well... lazy voice acting at best?  Lastly, the story. Just stop Bethesda, please for the love of god, please just leave Fallout alone. Story has never really been Bethesda's strong suit, but this games lack of it is... well... astounding for a new AAA release. If they decide to continue making RPG like games, they need to REALLY hire some decent writers, or contract out the story part to another studio.  I rated the game 5/10 because while not a horrible game on its own, it stands up to absolutely nothing fallout has ever been as a franchise. Seriously, if you're a fallout fan, just wait and buy it on when its on sale. If you're a huge fan of meaningless sandbox FPS's, ala RAGE, then give it a try, sure, but be prepared to be disappointed.… Expand "

You are given a full suit of powere armor within the first 30 minutes ruining any sense of progression in the early game. In addition your constantly having to fast travel to your power armor just to kill an enemy or two due to the new fuel requirements of it.

Great strides have been made since Fallout 3 and New Vegas but with a terrible cost. With Fallout 4, some key ingredients that make a fallout game have been cut way back. If you are new to the franchise, you won’t know what you are missing. My first impressions of this game having played Fallout 3 and New Vegas were not great. Goodbye skillpoints and interesting dialogue options. And I’m no graphics snob, but early in the game they were rough. Having completed the game, it becomes apparent there is something fundamentally off preventing this from being a good or even great fallout game, while a few bugs aside it would otherwise be considered a good game. Its an attitude really, and a general lack of self consistency that hurts the game. For instance the radio DJ is no 3 Dog, and sounds like a wet blanket in general. That along with a largely filler perk tree, and a very unbalanced difficulty progression seriously hurt the game. The good: The central theme, at least in theory. Is it slavery if the robots are self aware and have free will? This could be an interesting idea to play with. But aside from the single mission where SPOILER OMITTED turns out to be a synth, it was largely a botched execution. Gunplay is much better than previous games. I focused on rifles for my playthrough and it has now gotten to the point where I would target someone in VATS, ~50% chance to hit, miss 3 times (happens) and then blow them away using a simple scope without VATS and never miss. Other than targeting hard to spot enemies, and the occasional crit I was often better off not using VATS. I also like that grenades could be equipped the same time as a gun. The explosives mechanic in general was much improved. There was more variety with enemies, compared to previous games. Fighting Behemoth sized creatures is more fun than it used to be. In general the gameplay was less clunky and a bit better streamlined than previous entries. Voiced dialogue and cinematic camera was also a nice improvement, even if it did hurt creativity. The first couple times you use power armor is great fun. Though its not uncommon to ignore it completely until you have a surplus of fusion cores at the end of the game and not much to do. The bad: A key roleplay element of fallout games was lost. In previous entries having a high enough stat or ability unlocked different ways to complete missions, yielding different loot and sometimes different outcomes. By folding that into a perk tree, all of the uniqueness was lost. And a lot of the perk tree felt like filler. More than once I had to spent a couple points simply to unlock the ability I was interested in. Settlement building was an interesting idea but the execution was terrible. Sims does it better. I was looking forward to building off a fortress and fending off raiders. But bad enemy spawn points, arbitrary settlement limits, and a really rough interface sucked the fun out of that aspect of the game. Additionally it hurts immersion as the settlements you can build look radically different from the rest of the game. The level design of interiors is clearly optimized for radiant quests. If you keep doing the radiant quests, great. If not, its a repetitiveness that would have been better left empty. At its best Fallout games could tell a story with a few messages on terminals, oddly scattered loot and a skeleton or 3. This game either hit you over the head with something simple, or had nothing to say with its level design. In general the world felt like loot and enemies got dropped into it and didn’t feel lived in. The plot of the game itself, is sci-fi B-movie material. Which doesn’t have to be a bad thing. I kept drawing parallels to the Old World Blues. A series of highly implausible characters were locked in an endless struggle, and it worked on many levels. In this game the institute causes all sorts of problems on the surface because ??? Best answer I have is because plot. Nearly all characters in this game lacked any kind of motivation. What little there was usually came in the form of exposition instead of quests or events. Legendary guns started out a great idea. Unfortunately some of the statuses are OP and immersion breaking, while the rest are largely useless. The random drop nature of the weapons was fun at first, but by game end you’ll sift through a lot of terrible gear for anything that might be an improvement. The ugly. The view of the ground from a vertibird. Object clipping got really bad. Also in my playthrough the dialogue on a few companion quests was bugged. Quests stalled just before completion. If it happens to you, replacing the companion and then talking to them at a settlement allowed the quest dialogue to progress. Overall, not a bad game, but not quite the great leap forward from New Vegas we were all expecting prior to launch.… Expand "

I spent so much time exploring because the main story is pretty awful and the insertion of repeatable quests makes the game feel tedious till you discover there's no punishment for skipping them or reward for completing them.  The main story, writing aside, is a mess.  I'm not sure who you're supposed to be in this game, but it sure as heck isn't someone who just saw their whole world nuked to hell.  Nuking everything seems to be your go-to for many major plot lines.  The few people that should just be executed are protected by plot immunity.  And much of the story is delivered through text rather than through objects in the world and interactions in the world.  A lesson in avoiding exposition is really needed at the Bethesda offices.  The plot is... strange.  At some point mid game you accomplish your story starting goal and are left sort of spinning.  At that point you have the option of progressing the game through a few different paths, all of which involve being the sort of evil born by stupidity.  There's no option to be a good person, there's no option to be an evil person, you can't really rebuild civilization, no.  It's you choosing which way to screw everything up in a dramatic fashion.  The world itself is also fairly inconsistent.  We have slavers who buy and sell slaves only after they reach our contemporary age of majority.  We have whole cars made with steel and no parts.  We have a secret group whose existence is doubted despite their easily identifiable minions wandering around.  All that said, this is the first game I've played where I can stuff a computer nerds home made girlfriend fantasy into someone else's hot new body and make sweet love to it, so it does get some bonuses for weirdness.

In fact, I consider Fallout 4 one of the weakest entries in the franchise, even worse than Fallout 3, but I will explain below why.  I will start of with the fact that Fallout 4 doesn't let you roleplay too much, if at all. You always start of as a concerned father/mother who is looking for his/her son. Now, having a set background wouldn't be bad if it was designed properly, but unfortunately it is not. The player is forced into being a goodie-to-shoes good guy or sarcastic guy. The game does not allow you to play as, for example: Crazy Maniac, Sir talks a lot (can avoid almost every combat, by talking), Evil Emperor, or something in between. You can decide to not do a quest, but that is it. Either way it is still waiting for you and you can pick it up at any time. Of course there are times when you can be little bit evil, but they are far and between. So replayability and roleplaying were cut down a lot, which for RPG fans is a great deal, especially since most of them prefer to play as a someone they imagine rather than someone designed for them.  Of course there are games that are exceptions such as: Mass Effect or Witcher 3, but those games have got preset protagonist, while Fallout franchise never had one. Of course you would be: Vault Dweller, Chosen One, Lone Wanderer, Courier, but those are just titles and it is up to player to decide who they are and how they act. In Fallout 4 we do not get that freedom.  Now onto the characters. Most of the NPCs in the game are boring as hell. Even companions are hardly interesting and the way the react to your actions and how long it takes is poorly designed. For example, there is Curie, who you can impress by being nice, siding with Railroad, etc. But even after I did many things like that it takes ages to romance her, so no easy way with it I am afraid. The only companions I like so far are Dogmeat and Cadsworth, but other than that I want to shoot some of them in the face.  And here we get to another stupidity of Fallout 4- essential characters, they are almost everywhere. Basically, You are connected to the quest, I can't kill you. It breaks immersion and is annoying when there are some NPCs, like Mama Murphy who you want to shoot in the face, but you can't. The only thing you can do about her is to build her a chair, somewhere where no one will ever find her.  Now let's talk a bit about character progression and how inferior it is compared to Fallout NV or even Fallout 3. In both of those games you had to pick your special carefully, otherwise your build would be flawed and you would suffer a lot. They were RPGs that punished players for making stupid builds and mistakes. You could not become a Jack Of All trades because levels and perks were limited so you had to be careful what to choose. In Fallout 4 though, there isn't such thing. You can become 10 across all special, or even 11 if you pick boobleheads just by leveling up. There are very few builds that will make player miserable, such as the one focused on Charisma so it much less punishing than previous games. It is more streamlined, which for me is not a good thing.  Anyway, as you level up you can either boost your special or take a perk, which sounds good on paper but in practise it takes away from the game, because the most important thing in this game is to get you damage and let you build weapons. Other builds are much less optimal. It wouldn't be that bad, but because Bethesda cut out Skills, karma and reputation there almost no alternate ways to do quests. The only instance that required high int and nothing more was found by me after 40 hours of playing the game, which is just bad.  Now onto the quests and main storyline. The main quest takes the player through the ruins of commonwealth in order to find Shaun, the son of the Protagonist. Unfortunately it is quite predictable, and does not allow too much flexibility. In the end we find him and we have to decide which faction to support. So the main quest is bad, but it has never been great in most Bethesda games or even the most important. Side quests were the most important part of playing Fallout games. For example in New Vegas, there was a quest in Goodsprings, where you could side with either the town or the powder gangers. Doesn't seem impressive, does it? HOWEVER, you could join one of those sides whenever you wanted or even back stab the one you supported, for example: Side with powder gangers, but lay mines on the road and kill them all before they come to the town or just murd… Expand "

Not to mention that the dialogues have only four (sic!) outcomes where three of them are always yes, no and I don't know... The story is boring, the side quests are repetitive, gun play is fun but again - what if I don't want to shoot everything? Not an option most of the time. Technically the graphics are okay. Nothing fancy but not horrible. I was able to keep the game at a stable 60fps most of the time. Few glitches happened, nothing gamebreaking. But the damned loading screens! They're everywhere! SSD is a must otherwise fast travel can be as slow as running on a lower spec PCs. The facial animations are a bit... out there. Music is there. Forgettable but fitting the game. Now... FOV is vomit inducing, thankfully it can be adjusted with a simple command prompt still it only reminds me that there's no options menu! Everything is set up from the launcher that has a very limited options to choose from. Also the default controls are totally counter-intuitive! Most of the time they require you to grow a third hand - one in WASD area, one on the mouse and third one near the Enter key.

dabbas,"Nov 11, 2015",0,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Fallout 4 is the 4th numbered title in the Fallout  series developed by Bethesda Game Studios. Fallout 4 is a single player, open world RPG(role playing game) set in a post nuclear fallout America. The game was released on November 10th 2015 after its announcement at E3(electronics entertainment expo). Fallout 4 provided much of the same aesthetic found in previous titles with washed out colors and destroyed landscapes, which was the backdrop to my adventures as a drug abusing, raging alcoholic using his powerfist to beat down any enemy in his path. This essay will explore the history behind the Fallout series, the genre of the game and the aesthetic, as well as the narrative developed for this game. Fallout 4 was developed over 7 years, with the full focus of the 100 developers starting in mid 2013 (game was released November 2015), or about 5 years into development. The team that worked on Fallout 4 was small in relation to other dev teams developing games on a similar scale to Fallout 4. What is more, Fallout 4 beat out the previous best selling game of 2015, Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, which generated $550 within 72 hours, while the more popular Fallout 4 sold 12 million copies and generated $750 million in sales within 24 hours. Similar to other its predecessor, Fallout 4  is a single player, open world, adventure RPG set in a post nuclear apocalypse landscape. Fallout 4 remains one of the few AAA single player games, providing the player a balance of action level and story level creating the sense of interactive storytelling; developing a sense of immersion which helps the player feel invested in the story. Furthermore, Fallout 4 provides an insightful look into the idea of a nuclear apocalypse, which seems to bear relation to the 1960s aesthetic and that time period being associated with the cold war and the fear of nuclear war. Throughout my playthrough I chose to ignore the main questline created by Bethesda Game Studios’ developers, choosing to roleplay; adding an extra element of challenge to my playthrough. Instead of playing by the game’s rules and playing the role of a concerned father looking for his son, I play the role of a man distraught by the death of his wife and kidnapping of his son so he chooses to suppress his emotions with copious amounts of drugs and alcohol. Additionally, Bethesda Game Studios provided a plethora of new content with DLC(downloadable content) such as Fallout 4 Nuka World, which adds a completely new map; which is a theme park turned city, controlled by rivalling factions. As part of the DLC you quickly become the ruler of the park, giving the player a sense of power within the world. This DLC provides the player with, on average*, 12 and a half hours of extra gameplay. Aesthetic, when used within the context of a video game, is used to describe how a game makes you feel. Fallout 4 provides players with a vast landscape, littered with adventures and items, giving the player a constant stream of quests and new experiences. Another aspect of the game, which is seen in many Bethesda, games is the ability to switch in between third and first person, each of which give the game a different look and feel; while first person creates a sense of immersion as you play through the eyes of the character, playing with third person allows the player to separate themselves from the character, providing players with the same narrative experience through a different perspective. In conclusion, Fallout 4 provided me with a true single player experience, where I was immersed in a post nuclear apocalypse world. The game provides a balanced mix of focus on the narrative and aesthetic, which provides an interesting story wrapped in a pleasing looking and feeling package.… Expand "

The graphics is really good in my opinion but it's full of glitches at least on AMD. In terms of performance the game is terrible. On a high end AMD system you need to decrease shadow draw distance and reduce tesselation to make it playable with the rest on highest settings. Still on places high up in the air the framerate drops dramatically. Clearly a lack of optimisation because there are mods that reduce shadow draw distance dynamically or mods that add distance fog. Both something the developers could have implemented. What shocked me most is the amount of game play bugs. Some quests are almost a year after release and many patches later broken.

It could be, if it wasn't plagued by countless of problems and had a more interesting story.  Settlements are a great idea badly executed. Your biggest enemy aren't raiders, those are in fact completely harmless. Your enemy is the interface. If you attempt any kind of resource/storage management, you will be doing things either very slowly or many times over. The overall impression is that their definition of ""settlement"" are four people living in a hut.  Fallout 4 has the most cumbersome and badly designed interface I have ever seen. It is clearly made for consoles, and I doubt it's any good with a controller either, but it has been ported to the PC without any regards for the inherent differences between the platforms. The game is controlled by a limited amount of keys, which in return all have many different functions, more often than not completely unrelated ones, with the appropriate action being determined by your current point of view, or the menu/mode you're in. There is also a difference between long and short key presses with the duration for activating the secondary function varying between keys. It's indescribably bad and turns any kind of settlement management into a major time sink. A nightmare. The opposite of an enjoyable game.  Fallout 4 suffers from many bugs of various kinds, the majority of which are annoying but harmless. They do however make it even less immersive. Especially non-story dialog is often ridiculous to a point where it would be preferable not to have the characters voiced, especially if you have to live through those few and bad lines every time you interact with a settler.  The story is ok. Nothing to get excited about, but generally enjoyable. Their zero to hero approach for the protagonist is not believable, which took away a lot for me. First day in the army? Go have a chat with the supreme commander! You killed a few raiders? All hail our new general! YOU KNOW WHO THAT GUY IS? HE KILLED A [spoiler]    ! HE IS SO HOT! I assume there is an age at which you wank to such things. One has to try hard to block out all the following ""dear leader"" praises.  And no, you have no choice. There is no choice in this game. ""No"" is not an acceptable answer. You shall accept this quest. You can walk away, but you cannot refuse. Though I haven't tried trashing the Prydwen yet. Maybe they'd take that as a no.  If you focus on one quest line, the story would probably work better. There are different paths you can follow, all of which seem to be largely unaware of the others (up to the point I have played) and pretend to be demanding 100% of your attention. It's a game, so urgency often must be faked.  That's cool, unless you do so excessively, until the player cannot satisfy all urgent tasks, and the situation can only be resolved deus ex. It's often the normal state of affairs, you will have conflicting schedules most of the time, most notably, there is always at least one settlement that needs saving from something.  The game has its strong points, one of them being that even a mediocre Fallout universe is still kinda cool. Of course, the majority of players won't get to see much of it, because there are so many fast travel points, one often has to zoom in to find the correct on in the stack. But if one makes the seemingly strange decision to just go exploring, one will discover an interesting world. The Boston area depicted is pretty big, so the density of hidden tales to be found is lower than in FO3, but still decent.  There is greatness in Fallout 4 and its mediocreness is a tragedy. Many of the issues it suffers from are easily correctable, it fits the profile of a badly tested and unpolished product. Though if engine stability permits, and that's a big ""if"" with Bethesda, modders will turn this into the great game it could have been from the start. In the meantime, play some Project Nevada. :-)… Expand "

The devs also made some bizarre decisions, like not allowing us to remap most of the keys, I had to use external software to do it which is ridiculous.  I've just finished the main story and I feel like I'm done with the game, there's still plenty more to do I just don't feel like doing it. I never really enjoyed Settlements, it just felt like busy work, I had the most fun when I was following the main story or major side quests and now that's over I see no reason to keep playing, but I definitely don't regret my time spent in the Wasteland.  The game has a lot of issues or well things I didn't care for but most of them can be fixed or altered with mods, without mods Fallout 4 would be a far worse game that's for sure. Mods allowed me to remove a lot of the tedium, for example hacking and lockpicking, I can't imagine anyone enjoying those mini-games after the first time, but with mods you can remove the time spent fiddling with them, I tweaked the game to my liking and enjoyed it much more as a result.  Technically the game was really bad at launch but it's in a much better state now, but far from perfect, certain areas still tank the frame rate and you'll need to turn down several settings to medium if you value smooth gameplay and don't wish to dip under 60fps. I needed to down shadows, god rays and draw distance using a GTX 970 which kept me above the threshold in most areas, but at times I still dropped down into the 30s, but for the most part it was smooth and you can really tinker with the game depending on your PC. I should also note the loading times which are atrocious, without exaggeration the worst I have ever experienced, and I'm using 16GB 2133MHz RAM and a Samsung 850 EVO SSD.  Overall I enjoyed my time with the game and definitely do recommend it when on sale, for the £9.99 I paid I'm perfectly happy with what I got, but I am left wondering how good it could have been.… Expand "

Fallout 4 manages to bring on board everything that was good about the franchise but cram some unneeded mechanics that just seem to draw the game out for a longer length of time. Things like repairing now have to be done at a station rather then on the fly and whilst it was a simple as combining two pieces of equipment together last time it is now much more tedious and complicated. Other mechanics such as the new crafting system seem forced and feel like they were copied and pasted from another survival game. The chat system has been modified to feel more like something Bioware would make and whilst it works I never got the feeling that I knew what I was going to say before selecting an option. Immersion has been ripped from the game with full protagonist voice acting which adds to my list of unwanted features to the game. Don't get me wrong the voice acting is good but in a franchise which has the main goal of putting you as the protagonist this just pulls us back from the experience. Colour has filled the wasteland like never before but whilst we have nicer graphics the areas are generic and forgettable at best with mere copies of Fallout 3's environment. The addition of having to run a town is annoying with its population constantly poking you to find materials in order to make their lives better. I always enjoyed the idea of picking up my things in Fallout 3 and finding a small settlement to camp in whilst I try to level up or hunt for a specific item however with the mayor like system it has you pinned down to the same town from time and time again so whenever I explored the wasteland I would always have to pop back and use my valuable resources instead of modifying my equipment I would have to waste it on beds and other useless scenic props. The companions have never felt more alive with them responding to practically anything that is happening however the game only limits you to having one. I hate this as now I have to pick between companions that could have been a great combination. In the end Fallout 4 definitely does not live up to its predecessors and feels like a step back from the franchise that was moving so well. The game is good and I would happily sink many hours into it however I would rather go back to Fallout 3 and New Vegas as I will probably sink many more into them.… Expand 
wordwaster,"May 19, 2017",3,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          so disappointing in so many ways.  the heart and soul of fallout have been cut out of nearly every aspect.  in a real rpg i wouldn't love my spouse by default.  i wouldn't automatically say ""i'm so proud of him/her"" when looking at their law degree or ""i'll make them pay for this"" when looking at their corpse.  i would have the option to resent or even despise them.  because guess what...i DON'T love my in game spouse.  i feel no attachment to them at all.   i'm not a middle class former soldier with a newborn living in the suburbs, i have no personal connection to these predefined characters.   I should be the one that defines my own emotions, not the game.  i should decide how i interact with the world.  without choices this game lacks everything that made fallout great.  this isn't fallout.   this is just a game painted to look like fallout.  with one can of green paint  ok.  so i have to judge this game as a non-fallout game.  best way to sum this game up is settlements.   huge part of the game.    settlement construction is obtuse.  settlement management is a disaster.   for all the talk of ""streamlining"", you would think that settlement management would be...streamlined.   it isn't.    about 13 settlements in, i realize i want to change the way my supply lines are set up.  so i just go to the settlement management window, where all the relevant settlement issues can be easily inspected and dealt with.  wait....no.  that doesn't exist.    instead i have to go to each and every one of my settlements, track down each individual provisioner, and manually change their destination.   keep in mind that provisioners travel between settlements, so in a game where it can be hard to find settlers IN the settlements, finding the provisioner between settlements is a time consuming chore.   ""chore"" isn't a word that should come to mind when ""playing a game"".    and be careful that you get the right provisioner.   you may want to change the one travelling from a to b, but end up changing the one going from b to c instead.  because they aren't labelled.   they are all just ""provisioner""  just like the settlers are ""settler"".    how is it that as the person that constructed these settlements i don't know the names of the handful of people living in the town that i built?  hell it would be nice if their names were all just changed to their assigned task.  would be a huge leap to rename the farmers ""farmer"" and the guards ""guard"".    as it is there is no way to know who is assigned to what unless they are at their station.    which is a real problem if you stop in to manage things at night or if you use the bell to gather everyone up.  i always wanted to build my own vibrant community in the wastes.    the settlements in fallout aren't vibrant.    they are tedious.    dull.  this game is such an unbelievable mess.    and i'm not even referring to the technical issues.   the actual game, when working correctly, is a total mess.  and not the fun  ""everything is blown up"" sort of mess.  i could go one about how my inventory is constantly cluttered with dozens of variants of the same worthless gun.   completely disorganized because of the new mod system applying prefixes.    selling all your pipe guns requires searching through every weapon, every time.   because streamlined.  but i won't do that.  if i went through every aspect of the game interface that defied common sense, i would be writing all night.   the game interface is just BAD.   it is like no one on the design team actually played the game.… Expand "

Aside from a reasonable upgrade to the graphics (it still lags behind other AAA games from 2015, but there are mods that improve it further), and the addition of more nuanced crafting and upgrade mechanics, not much has changed since FNV. Combat has been improved, but it still lacks the feel or finesse of games that place more emphasis on this aspect. But that’s okay, because this is an RPG with FPS elements rather than the other way around. I don’t much care for settlement building so I did as little of this as possible, but from what I gather this feature is quite popular. The story isn’t particularly inspiring but it’s robust enough to propel the game, as is the faction element. For me, the most appealing thing about the Fallout games is the opportunity to explore a large open world environment and do cool stuff along the way. In this respect F4 delivers in much the same way as the previous two games did. However, I would’ve liked to see something new, and this is where F4 suffers: it’s not different enough.

It's a fun action game, if you ignore every single quest of the game, set in the fallout universe but it is not a fallout game. It lacks what made the previouse games so good. The importance of player decisions, the character skill system, the game changing perks and the re playability. I don't think that fallout 4 is meant to be re played with different characters, i think it's just about grinding your first one the perfect status at level 270. I don't know.

You can hit M to bring up the map, but you have to hit tab to close it.  The keys for switching around screens in your pip boy are equally dumb.  You have to manually edit ini files just to change mouse settings.  4) The story and writing are meh, but this is Bethesda so I kind of expected that.  A voice acted main character is stupid, and so is the mass effect dialogue.  I want my lines back where I can actually see what I'm saying before I say it.

Many keys are ""locked"", meaning that if you have a particular preference for play (especially if you are left handed and use the number pad for movement), you'll find yourself struggling with an ergonomic disaster. I spent several hours trying to get the whole WASD thing happening, but in the end, trying to override decades of habit was a pointless, futile exercise.  On the positive side, I've had no crashes and am perfectly happy with the graphics running on medium. I like the brighter colours of the game world and the general look of the game.  I also liked the new VATS, rather much to my surprise, as I expected it to be one of the things I hated. It slows the game to the point where you don't feel completely rushed to assess and decide on your enemies weak spots, but not so slow as to remove any sense of urgency. Indeed, I think they hit the sweet spot with VATS, because whereas in previous games, was a useful time to go make a cup of tea, now it contains a welcome element of danger.  I thought that the opening sequence was well done and gave me a good sense of atmosphere. I didn't find it particularly hard to put myself in the mind of the protagonist and empathise with her experience of the end of the world and confused reawakening.  Sadly, the game failed to run with what could have been a really engrossing and RPG filled transition 200 years into the future. Almost as soon as I was out of the vault, I fully acclimatised with morphing from a suburban housewife and lawyer into a sociopathic killer. Within 30 minutes of leaving the vault, it was quite clear that I was just another FPS cardboard cutout.  Having abandoned a potentially awesome ""girl out of time"" storyline, for one written by hacks, the devs preceded to abandon the survival and life threatening danger that has made previous games great. The first mistake was giving the player powered armour and a minigun at the very start of the game. Now, if this was just a teaser for things to come, with a storyline removal of the armour and gun, that'd be kinda cool.  But it isn't. In fact after nine hours of gameplay in which I reached about level 6 I had found a total of three suits of power armour and had three cores to power them. Now, any difficulty is a fast travel away from being eradicated (fast travel didn't seem to use any of the power either). Power Armour is the peak of armoured perfection and should not simply be handed out on a platter. When you get it, you should feel like you've achieved something, not been visited by your drunk fairy godmother.  Forget roleplaying. Dialogue options in this game are atrocious. with only four selections and no real idea of what your character is going to say. Half the time, one of them seems to be ""sarcastic"", but you've no idea in advance if that means ""douchebag"", or ""witty rejoinder"". In previous games, you could actually see what your character was going to say and you weren't limited to only four options. In any case, most people aren't sarcastic, so making that the only ""role playing"" choice probably speaks to Devs with significant social and relationship issues. Kind, sympathetic, angry, joyful, or worried would have worked just as well.  Mind you, given the two dimensional nature of the conversations and NPCs and the fact that all conversations seem to lead to the same outcome, it doesn't really matter what answer you give. Your path has already been pre-ordained and you are going to get on that railroad!  With respect to NPCs, Fallout 4 lacks the humour and vibrancy of previous titles. Enemies seem generic with little to distinguish one group from the others. Don't expect to find a Moira from Megaton, Sunny Smiles, or even a Gob in this universe. The closest I saw was one character with mystic powers, but the potential was lost through poor voice acting, the crappy conversation wheel and the fact that she only seemed to exist as an accessory to the main story, rather than as a living and breathing person with a will of her own.  The dumbing down of SPECIAL and perks from previous games is really disappointing. If you want to be able to open locks, or hack computers (and you do), you want perception and agility 4, which means you've eaten up 6 of your 21 SPECIAL starting points.  While, a mere 3 points in Agility will enable you to take all the perks you need in order to sneak like a pro, many of the high level perks are marginal, (rooted, nerd rage, sniper, ghoulish and solar powered come to mind) or way too specific and pointless for almost any build (Idiot Savant).  To the extent that I used the settlement building simulation I found it to be tedious, counter intuitive and difficult to navigate. Some RTFM might have helped, but by then I was beyond caring, and left them to starve, while I gave up on the game.… Expand "

They need to do something about this since it has been true since Daggerfall and it seems to be regressing since new games are less RPG and more FPS which is exactly what RPG gamers dont want. I do like the city building albeit Bethesda did a horrible job implementing it in vanilla game. It has tons of modding potential as long as they didnt lock down all the functionality. City building seems to not work right as enemies somehow bypass defenses and walls... im guessing they spawn in the center of town or something like that. Plus there really is no reason to do it. This is not the Sims...  As a side note, all I did from levels 1 to about 15 is wander and it was an ok experience. I ran across quests on accident rather than on purpose and I did so on survival (highest) difficulty. The game is ridiculously easy which is not good and again, plays like a FPS. There is really no strategy at all in combat (or more accurately, there are only 3 strategies and that is all). I ran across a wandering super mutant as early as level 3 while wandering and even more when I got closer to Diamond City but they were all super easy in this game and I didnt even use any of my power armor. I also fought several legendary enemies but it really didnt matter, I killed them very easily to the point that I didnt even notice that some were ""bosses."" Like Oblivion, this game 'feels' very small and cramped compared to older games... I am not sure why or if that is even true, but it sure feels that way.  As stated above, this game does dumb down RPG elements, make no mistake about that. It definitely plays like a FPS and your perks really dont matter. In fact, I have not put a single point into anything damage related in my game, I just put them all into opening locks, hacking, and modding stuff which to me means that this game is not an RPG at all. Your build changes nothing and you dont need a build of any kind to succeed. In fact, you dont need any perks at all. You can win with just found weapons, and assigning perk points randomly or not at all. This is not good... its supposed to be an RPG.  Crafting is also not exactly innovative. Its basically enchanting but replace spells with found junk minus the variety but with the chance for more ""enchantments"" per item (especially on weapons). This is not new or innovative and it was still done much better in Morrowind before they started the dumbing down of their games.  Still, the game is very polished. I did not run into any bugs and I only got stuck in a corner once requiring a reload. The story is boring and the character interaction is very dry. Again, story is not Bethesdas strong suit. I think it is at least slightly above average. If 5/10 is the mean, then this game is slightly better but not great. It will need heavy modding to make it fun.… Expand "

Graphics are vastly improved and looks really good on PC, launch Fallout 3 and New Vegas then load up Fallout 4, character models look much better, there's some much nicer environmental effects and a much better draw distance, the texturing is weak in Fallout 4 which will get fixed (as they would anyway) once modding tools are released but they should have been much better for PC to begin with!  Weak points are terrible UI and UI controls, weak dialogue system which is quite limited and doesn't change much to the gameplay, bigger map but things feel more spread out so lots of emptiness inbetween awesome looking places (pro and con here), the story is so-so and questing is nothing special.  But once again Bethesda creates a stunning world to explore, an amazing atmosphere that pulls you in, great sense of wonder as you explore every inch of the map, tinkering with your power armour(s) has the same addictiveness as Mad Max's Magnum Opus! Crafting is much better in FO4 and building settlements is the icing on the cake. You can now play in 3rd person thanks to the much better animations. FO4 feels more like STALKER than Fallout as it's more about action and exploration with questing as a distraction and light RPG elements, but I'm a big fan of STALKER so this change to Fallout's RPG system doesn't bother me so much but would have preferred it if Bethesda stuck to Fallout's roots and they experimented with a new IP.… Expand "

Fortunately they've included a quick save feature in this game. Presumably because they expected it would crash a lot and players would need to save often.

The rest of the game is you staring at one of a million different inventory screens trying to decide which random junk in the world (and OMG is there ever so much of it) is worth waiting through the constant barrage of loading screens to bring back to sell/scrap/whatever.  I quit and left the game a terrible review with a clean conscience.  I couldn't be paid to play that inventory management game.  However, I decided to give the game another chance after finding out that there was a cheat that allowed your character to just carry everything.  Between that and ""favorite flagging weapons"" the tedium of the game has been reduced by maybe 80% (still constant and unnecessary loading screens).  This allowed me to get deep enough into the game to realize just how huge and dynamic the game is.  Truly impressive that they've made a game that is this deep and that functions (if limpingly) as a FPS on both PC and console platforms.  Ultimately, I'd say the game is underrated, but I absolutely do not blame the legion of players that didn't cheat, didn't give the game a 2nd chance, and just left a terrible rating.  Without cheating, the game deserves the rating.  A follow up recommendation for the game studio would be to have multiple difficulty sliders.  One for difficulty (functioning as it currently does) and another for realism (affecting carry weight, radiation exposure consequences, healing, and all of those other things that make post-apocalyptic survival a drag).… Expand "

(Винтовки – зачет, двустволка – отстой.) - дерганое прицеливание: прицел от бедра – резкий, прицел с мушки – медленный. - реактивные враги, созданные для остановки времени в ВАТС, но... - ВАТС - лучше им не пользоваться, она раздражает, выдергивает из атмосферы игры. А потому что это не пауза, а замедление. И т.к. враги постоянно двигаются, клики мышкой не попадают туда, куда ты ее навел пол секунды назад. И ладно бы он полезен бы, давая время подумать. Девиз F4: «Меньше думай, чаще стреляй» - 2 силовых брони - штатный годмод - пылятся на складе, т.к. это Имба в защите, быстрые, и можно еще больше таскать барахла. Больше хлама богу хлама! Собсно, как грузовик броня только и нужна. Но с броней играть скучно. Врагов, стОящих того, чтобы носить броню почти нет. - ИИ – его будто нет. Алгоритм робота-пылесоса – также противники тыкаются в стены, ломятся как леминги на смерть, ходят спиной вперед. И это я про стрелков. Хотя, иногда прячутся за укрытия, бывает. Противники же ближнего боя – как по лекалам скайрима. Но это кротокрысы, гули – они должны быть неадекватные и агрессивные… В общем, как и писал ранее – это скайрим с автоматами. - Псина (спутник), полезна как ходячий рюкзак и приманка; иногда раздражает, не давая проходу.  Мир подозрительный - За 200 лет сна все бы развалилось-сгнило: начиная от деревянных домов до бумажных плакатов(!), еды, микросхем, проржавело железо, скелеты в труху.

На единице выносливости, силы, восприятия, ловкости в обычном режиме сложности игра - прогулка. - Режим же Выживание бредовый - чтобы убить полуметрового комара - 5 пуль надо. А комар сразу смертельный. Усложнение ради усложнения - чтобы вообще всего боятся. И ладно бы адекватные враги были. - Из полезных перков мне были интересны: влом замков, хак терминалов, крафт оружия, брони. Все остальное шлак, чтобы занять место в таблице перков, и их можно оставить на 50+ уровень. Я читал описания некоторых перков и думал – нафига это надо?! Их будто делали для другой игры. - Харизма и, в частности, диалоги. Ну, сделали бы сразу кат-сцены как в КоД, чтобы без выбора. - Кач на умение использования видов оружия, брони - не нужен, т.к. герой сразу умеет из всего что стреляет метко попадать. Ну и что еще мне делать в РПГ, если все пухи доступны? [Сарказм]: «Общаться с НПС?»… В общем, остается учится улучшать пушки, броньку, собирать хлам по помойкам для их улучшения, да и учится вскрывать замки.  Сюжет -  Найти сына, покарать убийц супруги – лан, для галочки-затравки, думал, может мясо еще побочными квестами нарастёт, мир выпуклый будет… - Но квесты я походу плохо искал. «Надо лучше, не сдавайся!» - все также обещали мне критики… - На самом деле сюжет такой - это игра о «великой стройке». «Возродить страну – не шуточки, минитмен. Тебе, генерал, нужно провести геноцид рейдеров, построить дома, кровати, турели, заселить жителями, и посадить, наконец, карТошку» – фактически, говорит мне мой подчиненный.

While I can appreciate that it tries something new, it does not accomplish what it sets out to achieve as I had a hard time getting invested in those characters.  The gunplay is very smooth and responsive, a significant improvement from earlier fallout games. The character moves well, but I encountered graphical errors where my character was holding a weapon, but the weapon was nowhere to be seen in my hand. Some quality of life improvements like hovering over containers to see their contents was also something I enjoyed, but it did take away from some suspense. Character interaction feels gimped as your options are vague and there are instances where the playable character does not really say what I want them to say.  I experience some frame drops when there was too much going on, and found myself having to look at my feet to move through some areas smoothly. I don't play on the best hardware so I can sort of forgive that, it's a nuisance that detracts from my experience however.  Fallout 4 is an okay game, but does not feel like a very great Fallout game. If you've got the hardware to play it on full graphics the visuals can be a treat, but if you are in it for the Role Playing experience and enjoy building a character then it might be best to wait a year or three for the modding community to fill in the blanks.

I won't spoil except to recommend Goodneighbor and railroad.  2. Followers getting story arcs now and showing personality that is more than their previous skin-deep characterization which is a welcome change. They have unique dialog for many of the game's locations (not just major ones, either) As they interact with you you gain the ability to meaningfully change their outlook and methods in life... just one of many concepts Beth has skillfully lifted from Bioware/Obsidian storytelling.  3. The levelbuilding of this game is staggering, 3, sometimes 4 vertical layers...  4. A number of intuitive changes, quick-access grenades, enemies utilizing cover, the opening of containers has been streamlined so you can just grab what you want from a very efficient dropdown menu, which takes a lot of the hassle out of looting. You can tell they spent a lot of time with their hands on this game and wanted it to feel very crisp.  5. Crafting. I cannot tell you how satisfying changing the sights on a gun can be... or deciding between hipfire and aimed accuracy on your shotguns for example. Also the feeling of working hard to collect enough fertilizer for grenades and then tossing those bad boys during a fight.  Bethesda has given us another great canvass where we can paint our own stories and fill in our own blanks. Some of that will be done with rp, and some with mods and I look forward to both.

Gorycory,"Jul  6, 2020",5,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Let me preface my review by saying, it's mediocre, hence the 5.  Ok, so, I bought into this hype. I was on the hype train standing next to the conductor my dick hanging out the side wailing like an imbecile as we barreled down the track at full speed, not a care in the world. When all of a sudden we hit a bump, and that bump was November 10th 2015. All of a sudden the game was out and I was in it, a smile erupted across my fave as I began digging into it, like I do any good game.  I don't usually get hyped, I mean I do, but no this hyped. I was waiting like a 10 year old waits for Christmas, I was giddy and ready for the next installment of one of my favorite game series. I have literally loved every other iteration, Fallout 1, Fallout 2, Fallout 3 and New Vegas (Didn't play the other two). Suffice to say, I was **** pumped.  I'm now about 20ish hours in, which is a fair amount of game play, enough to get my subjective experience to the internet. So, here it goes.  I'm the kind of RPG gamer that usually doesn't do the main story first, I root around and find all the side quests first and work my way through them. I like to get everything I can done first. So, excited for the settlement system I tumble into the first town ready to dive into some of it. First thing I notice is scraping and how unintuitive it is, not a good sign but not horrible. I start building my settlement, a few random things here and there, work on that for about 2 hours. I am kind of enjoying myself. I mod my first weapon and I am thinking. **** yeah this is great!"" I saddle up and head into my first town. Immediately I notice that the combat feels A LOT better. There didn't seem to be skill checks anymore on shooting, so it felt more like an FPS than previous Fallout installments. Now I have read a lot of negative reviews saying it's an ""adventure shooter"" or ""It's an FPS with RPG elements"" I beg to differ, this is what we as a community clamored for, we wanted this. We wanted to be less reliant on VATs and to do that Bethesda made it so we could go without it completely, and we can. It's an FPS now, and FPS RPG. There's still stats, and there's still perks that still do pretty cool stuff. That being said, the game it's base is one of the few things I think holds up as a Bethesda game and as a Fallout game. The feel of Fallout is missing, the immersion is missing... It doesn't pull me in, the combat feels good and killing raiders and super mutants with my pimped out weapon rocks. But, where's my universe? Where is my atmosphere that I so desperately need and love about Fallout? They threw it out the window and instead gave us repeatable quests and lengthy ultimately pointless side quests.  EXAMPLE (SPOILER): I went on a side quest, an actual side quest they wrote and put in the game to retrieve a can of paint. A can of green paint, A **** CAN OF GREEN PAINT. Sure, the old games used to give you quests like this. But Fallout 4 just seems to have given up on the reason it was created in the first place, it's a husk of its former glory, nothing more than a shadow of a company that's getting too much money to remain true to the art form. We've seen it over and over, Bethesda, Blizzard, EA, and UbiSoft. With each moving decimal point the game loses quality exponentially til we end up with nothing at all.  I wanted to like this game, I really did, I even went to this very site and denied your reviews. I denied them vehemently with my friends, who agreed. We all boasted about how you didn't know what you were talking about and you just wanted to jump on the edgy I hate Bethesda train, but it's legitimately lost it's soul. The positive reviews are from people that don't much care about that, they just love the customization and combat. I really hope Elder Scrolls doesn't meet the same fate.… Expand "

But all the negativity aside, they did stick to what they did best and so far it provides plenty of exploration, gunplay, dialog and interesting stories to engage in.  The price in Canada was very steep for a AAA game.

You would think playing on a high end PC would improve the game, but since you need to lock the fps o 60 so you don't get bugs you also get stuck with long loading screens you would except from a console game. Controls are also wonky with keyboard and mouse which made me switch to using a controller instead.

You may be surprised that there are areas on the map I still haven't set foot on. Let's start with the graphics. They are perfect. Not only are the textures and shaders quite good, but the actual look of the game is spot on. I have never seen a Fallout game look this ""Fallout-like""(not even Fallout 1). The cars, the guns, the buildings, everything you see will only further immerse you into the retro-futuristic post-apocalyptic world of Fallout. The sound. People don't talk about sound in video games enough anymore. Fallout 4 has some of the best music in games to date, and certainly the best of the past few years. In addition, the in-game radio station plays some great 1950's music that fits perfectly into the setting, and the devs went out of their way to record original songs as well. The writing is excellent. Where Fallout 3 was too much based on a personal mission, and New Vegas focused only on factions and politics, Fallout 4 brings a great mix of the two to the table. The story is one of the best open world stories in the last decade, with actual consequences and a proper impact on the world. Side quests are quite satisfying as well, and often dosed with a healthy amount of humor. When it comes to the game's world, Bethesda never fails, and the team has outdone themselves once again. On the micro level, the world is rich and detailed. You can easily read the labels on cereal boxes, or enjoy some great art on the covers of magazines. On the macro level, the Commonwealth, and Boston are huge and breathtaking. Where New Vegas disappointed with a flat, boring world design, Fallout 4 intrigues, with every alley being a potentially rewarding route. The core gameplay is where it's all at though. And that's where Fallout 4 shines. The combat is amazing. Simply put, it parries that of FPS games, and pretty much stomps on every other guns RPG ever. Power armor gameplay is executed perfectly, and definitely makes up for the absence of vehicles. Crafting is possibly the best I have ever seen in any game, with every object in the game actually being useful as material. The settlement system is brilliant and limited only by your imagination, allowing players to create entire cities in the wasteland. The enemies are quite fun to battle with. Humanoids will use grenades to flush you out of cover while in cover themselves, mole rats will ding through the ground to attack you from the rear, Deathclaws will zig-zag to avoid your attacks while closing the distance, and so on.  So to conclude, this is an amazing game, and if you don't already own it you're doing something wrong.… Expand "

To improve a skill, you select the skill in the perk tree on leveling up rather than having points to spend, or having skills improve with use a'la Skyrim.  There is no karma and no in-game consequences for being evil- except you may lose traction on any romance you may have going.  The romance system is so rudimentary it falls to the level of parody.  Worst of all, there is no way to craft ammunition- the single biggest improvement in F:NV.  Have 2000 rounds of .38?  Too bad.  Sell it for 1/10 the  value and buy 20 rounds of .50 from a gouging vendor.  This is my single biggest complaint in the game- ammo is at a premium but 3/4 of what you find is of no use to you.  The good:  And yet, at the end of the day, the game delivers most- not all, but most- of what a Fallout game represents.  The world space is detailed and large.  There are many quests, both scripted and radiant.  They take you all over the world space.  Weather and other environmentals are well portrayed.  The interiors are well put together.  Probably the most radical new component is the settlement building system- you finally have a use for all the random junk you keep finding.  Combat is good and V.A.T.S. is vastly improved into a sort of bullet time rather than the old -freeze everything, place your shots like a game of Battleship, unfreeze and watch what happens- model.  If this had been the first Fallout using the Bethesda engine and design philosophy, it would be an exceptional game.  Problem is, it isn't.  And it's 2015, not 2008.  F3 was a great game that I still play to this day.  F:NV took the good things about F3 and gave us more and improved on the original.  Fallout 4 is a step backwards.  It feels flat.  It almost feels like they decided to put out a baseline vanilla game knowing the mod community would improve it.  It's the same disappointing taste I had with Mass Effect 3 though not as shattering.  Still, worth playing and once the GECK comes out, mods will address the shortcomings.  I'd wait for it to be on sale though.… Expand "

It's much more stable than Skyrim at release, that's for sure.  It's a fun game and certainly was worth it's money, but it's seriously lacking in every aspect, if you expect more than a shooter. I've expected the game to be dumbed down when I first heard about the fully voiced protagonist, but the dialogues are almost non present. You get the choice between three or four option and your player says something. But whatever they say, it has absolutely no influence on how your opposite reacts. You can outright insult them and they just go on with their dialogue, as if nothing happened. Same goes for quests. Refuse to do them and they end up in your journal nonetheless.  Which brings me to quest design, if you want to call it that. It's almost always, shoot, kill, fetch, repeat. It's worst with the radiants that are handed out in kind of a driveby shooting manner. Pass a questgiver on the streets and you got another one in your journal. They take you to locations, you have visited about a million times before, to kill the same bunch of generic enemies again and again and again. Bethesda never were great storyteller, but this main quest may be the worst attempt at drama they ever made. I won't go into details here, suffice to say, it creates a false sense of urgency without drawing you in emotionally. And it is mainly, you already guessed it, shoot, kill, fetch, repeat.  I would be hard pressed to point out even one memorable quest in the whole game.  So, companions. You can romance them now, if you want to call it that. It's mainly brownie point collecting to aquire the stat they hand out, if their disposition towards you is maxed out. They like and dislike certain actions you take, which is perfectly fine, since it adds to character. What's not fine is, that you can romance almost all simultaneously. You can set up a mixed harem, regardless of gender, since all of them swing both ways without any of them being jeallous of the other. I'm fine with miixed or gay, but it should be in character. Not everyone should be available to everyone, just because. And not everyone should be available at the same time. It breaks immersion in a big way and renders romances totally meaningless. Which is a pity, since some of the characters are really interesting. In fact, their design is one of the select few reasons why I'm not rating that game on the red scale.  Immersion is another big no no. I'm with Bethesda since Morrowind and they still haven't managed to create a reactive NPC environment. The ordinary NPC, even if you already met them about a thousand times already, treats you like the dirt under their shoes from start to finish. It has been that way with every Beth game. Regardless of your achievements, you end up as Johnny or Jane noname to be exposed to any snide comment.  Settlement building is a nice addition and another reason why I move the game slightly to the plus side. But, as everything else it stays half assed and is a pain in the backside to manage on the PC. It's so obviously designed for console that it's extremely clunky with mouse and kkeyboard. Nothing wrong with designing for console, but please don't treat PC as an afterthought without being arsed to implement a UI and controls that are manageable without getting frustrated.  All in all I had my fun. But now I get bored even reflecting on that game. I won't pick it up again until the modding community takes care of quest design, stories and UI. If that is ever going to happen, since I realize that voiced characters are just one of the stepping stones to make life more difficult for modders.… Expand "

It seems to be plagued with minor graphical glitches, mechanical inconsistencies, and a overall lack of basic features everywhere.  In a game about shooting, you would think a glitch that prevents you from pulling the trigger or being able to reload would be something the QA team would have caught and ironed out long ago.  The sad part is, Bethesda probably knew about every glitch and error, but chose to release it anyways, knowing full well that they would still make a killing from this game's release.  I could probably end it like that, ""Fallout 4: good enough to not hurt our sales"".  And that's truly what this feels like, a calculated game from upper management where the errors were left to the modding community to fix.  If they could get away with not putting it into the game, they didn't.  Why waste resources when you know other will do a better job and for free.  It's very difficult to explain why, for example, a player cannot see their own weapon holstered, like they could in fallout 3, New Vegas, Oblivion, Skyrim, etc. etc. etc.  Yes, the weapons are configurable and so you can literally start with a gun the size of a pistol and mod the thing into a full sized sniper rifle, which would look ridiculous if it was holstered on the leg, but you can't tell me they couldn't figure out some algorithm where the engine looks at what mods are on a given weapon to determine the size and placement when not in your hand?  Modders will figure that out ASAP as soon as they are given the tools.  And this isn't just a minor oversight, something where you can just configure a .ini file to show holstered weapons, it flat outs doesn't exist!  Bethesda didn't even bother to make the sheathing animations for characters!  It is ridiculous, for example, that on the character select screen there is no 'randomize' feature for the character creation!  Indeed it will ALLWAYS default to white male.  A few years ago, this would have been acceptable as the 'normal' for this industry, but in this day and age with this level of technology?  Really?  Can't do it?  I can't make the girl the war vet?  Ok, what about inconsistencies, such as if I step on a landmine and immediately reload my save, the trap is now gone.  What about basic game settings, such as a gamma slider in the options menu so I can adjust the darkness, so that I can actually see something at night? That seems like a somewhat major oversight, the ability to change the darkness/brightness settings in the game!  Maybe it's some setting in the .ini file, a number I can adjust?  NOPE, DOESN'T EXIST!  I had to download a retexture mod to overhaul the entire engine to make everything visible to me, because even at max brightness/contrast settings on my screen it was still too dark!  The most glaring of problems in this game seem to be the overall LACK of features, simple fixes and small changes that should have been in this game at launch.  Witcher 3 showed us that massive worlds can exist with little to no loading screens and Call of Duty plays smooth with weapon cycling and doesn't leave the player foundling air, waiting for a gun to spawn before being able to return fire.  If the old engine can handle it, make a new engine!  If this game had come out 4 years ago, would have been groundbreaking!  As a AAA game today?  It's sad.

Does Fallout 4 excel beyond its predecessors? No... Fallout 2 and 3 will remain as the highlight of the series. The reason it falls short is due to the stripped down RPG elements. The game feels more like a FPS action adventure rather than an Open World RPG. Dialog choices rarely have more than 3 words. You get longer dialog chat in Mass Effect 3 than you do in Fallout 4. The perks have been streamlined and it seems characters are less reliant on skills. The story falls short compared to the cinematic experience of Fallout 3 and NV. The game is also severely hindered by bugs and glitches (but that has always been a problem for Fallout).  Some good aspects would be the shooting, it has more action which is nice and all but the option to go without killing is no longer an option. Charisma is worthless cause you rarely get to persuade people and the story won't make you care much to want to see the different outcomes (if there are any). The weapon modding and crafting system is amazing though! You can completely customize weapons and change their ammo loads too. You can take a gun and tool it around to be a completely different weapon. The exploration is rewarding and the side quest are fun yet simplistic ""go shoot these people"" which can get repetitive. If this was called something else, if this wasn't tied to Fallout this game might even be considered a great game. But we're fans, we can't help but compare and Fallout 4 just does not live up to that comparison.  Graphics? Fallout fans should not be whining about graphics, Fallout has never been a series which delivers extremely high end visuals. The Fallout code is simply ""gameplay over graphics"" so if the gameplay doesn't compensate then yeah I understand.... but where were you all when Fallout 3 came out with rather poor visuals and textures? Didn't care about it huh? Cause the game made up for it.  This is NOT a 3 out of 10 or lower because 3 usually means a really poorly designed indie game like Day One Garry's Incident or Slaughtering Grounds. It's definitely not a 10 either. If you're a fan of Fallout you might not call this a great game but it still provides a lot of fun entertainment. If the game was bad I could stop playing it but I can't put it down.

To keep this spoiler free as possible I won’t go into the details but the main story is also poorly written and is not immersive.  Lastly despite the graphical and gameplay improvements the game overall seems unpolished for example the UI and settings for PC is horrible you will have to mod and play around with the ini files. But this is nothing new for Bethesda games (Wait for SDK to be released).  TLDL: Good Game, just not a good fallout game. Just wait for the MODS.… Expand "

And that is degradation due to taste. The thought and quality put into all the systems this game has to offer deserve more, but taste is a fickle thing.  Some fallout purists, who either can't move on from the original turn-based RPG, or those who wanted a tit for tat sequel to 3/NV where nothing but the graphic fidelity and performance changed tend to not like this game.  But if your someone willing to embrace the new, and give it a chance without sticking your nose up at the thought of something being different from a previous game- then it's worth your time to try it. If you've never played fallout before, I recommend trying someone else's game before you buy into it. This IP isn't for everyone, and while I think the game mechanically is a great one for any fallout virgin to break into, some people simply wont enjoy it. And that's their opinion. But their opinion doesn't deserve the right to assault the game with a 0/10.

The Witcher 3 did a much better job in thisHaving played both Fallout 3 and New Vegas, I began Fallout 4 expecting a great post-apocalyptic experience with memorable characters, enemies and weapons. Fallout 4 has delivered on most of these fronts.  The main story is somewhat disappointing since your actions throughout the course of the game do not generally alter the ending you get. The Witcher 3 did a much better job in this aspect. Of course, what makes a great Fallout game is the storytelling you find in the various sidequests. Many of the quests in Fallout 4 are tied to one faction of another, similar to how quests are structured in Skyrim (see e.g. the Dark Brotherhood or College of Winterhold chain of quests). Unfortunately, many of these quests are of the fetch item X or clear location Y variety. To be fair to Bethesda, there were some truly great moments, such as meting out justice to evildoers as a masked vigilante.  Graphically, Fallout 4 is rather mediocre for a 2015 release. Character models are clunky and facial animations are lacklustre. However, I must commend Bethesda's environment artists for creating a beautiful post-apocalyptic world, especially when viewed from afar. Just don’t look too closely at the textures.  Despite its many flaws, Fallout 4 manages to recapture the joy of exploring the wasteland, killing mutated beats and looting their corpses. Combat is much improved, making this feel like a solid FPS should you choose to play it like that. One key difference from previous instalments is the ability to build settlements, aka Minecraft mode. Although the UI is finicky, I found myself having quite a bit of fun trying to build the perfect accommodations for my settlers. Unless you’re a diehard, the novelty soon wears off after the first few settlements.  Overall, Fallout 4 is a solid entry in the franchise. Despite failing to reach the great heights of its predecessors, Fallout 4 nonetheless provides many hours of entertainment.… Expand "

Unfortunately, Bethesda really made this game for a casual playthrough. You won't see any hardcore RPG mechanics like karma or cool dialogue (which has been dumbed down to 4 buttons, each with the same outcome). Fallout 4 has more shooting aspects and less immersive role-playing as the sole-survivor. Quests feel linear and repetitive, and there is very little interesting NPC action. The story is predictable with twists that you can see pretty clearly. Characters are not very memorable. The game definitely felt like it downgraded compared to the other games.  But some people like the aesthetics brought out in this game. Bethesda improved some mechanics as well and made things easier. Albeit the same reused engine, the graphics and lighting look great for an openworld game. The atmosphere is clearly displayed in the ruined wasteland, and it feels like a fallout. Shooting things in the wasteland is actually more fun and smoother, adding an easy way to switch between weapons and stimpaks. V.A.T.S. feels less like a necessity now. The AI is not the best, but they feel more lively instead of running straight to you like in 3 or New Vegas. Crafting and modding weapons is actually pretty fun too, and it felt much less complicated and more easier to access.  You might wanna buy this game if you like an FPS/TPS with a spice of role-playing elements. Plus with survival in beta for PC you might have some extra enjoyment out of your time.

Particularly since many of those ""reviews"" are focused on whining about the graphics, FPS mechanics (in an ACTION RPG game) and a story that I feel these players did not understand. At the same time,I had the urge to register just to give my impression of a fair review given all the unfortunate 0/10 scores which make absolutely no sense (to be fair, some 10/10 are overly enthusiastic). Particularly since many of those ""reviews"" are focused on whining about the graphics, FPS mechanics (in an ACTION RPG game) and a story that I feel these players did not understand. At the same time, there is a total disregard for many innovative gameplay features like the weapon and stronghold crafting systems (which rightfully puts the DA:I crafting choices at a subpar level), a wonderful, huge map which I honestly never felt like it was boring.  In my opinion, the positives start with the fact that it feels like a Bethesda game. Plenty of places to explore, lot of little quests and fun side trips aside from the main missions, decent enough fighting and shooting engine for an ACTION RPG. This is not Call of Duty, nor it should be, and while it is indeed a bit flawed, it is completely appropriate for the type of game. Add up that Bethesda did learn something from Obsidian and decided to create an entire crafting system that actually makes you scrounge for junk in the wasteland (something could be expected in a postapocalyptic game). It offers many options to use your weapons and armor, combined with several perks in the leveling system to tailor your  ""class"" to your needs (I like the high INT, PER shooter build, but I see many are having a blast with the high END, STR tank builds and the high AGI sneaky dudes). It also offers the ability to create and shape new settlements, a feature that has taken me at least 20% of my time. This settlement feature granted its not for everyone, but unlike the Batmobile in Arkham Knight you can totally disregard it if you want your gameplay concentrated on other matters.  I am totally in disagreement with those who think the story was bland. Maybe because I have played plenty of Pen & Paper RPGs, but I honestly don't need 10 minute introduction concentrated in your background to get in character. I felt that the introduction was enough to become the Sole Survivor and make the quest for his family my quest. Given that, I enjoyed the story, the plot twist and the moral choices presented to you particularly in the final act. My impression is that the story was awesome, and a good way to measure is to ask which faction did people initially decided to side. The fact that many get the moral quandaries and/or can become outraged at other people ""wrong"" choices should tell you Bethesda played its cards right. The game includes several silly quests that can be highly amusing (""calling the Silver Shroud!"") and homages to Lovecraft, 1950s alien sci-fi, the Salem Trials, etc. The detail, IMHO is in the right places, even if in the end the graphics are not at the same level as EA's Frostbite engine.  As for the negative, the reason why I didn't give this game a 10/10 is because I dock one point off due to the outdated graphics and the many minor bugs, particularly with the AI scripts. I feel this is not a major issue, and honestly, the last thing I want Bethesda to do is to become EA and release a SW:Battlefront game that looks amazing but has a deficient gameplay and story. At the same time, we should not pretend this issue does not exist. I hope Bethesda invests in a new, true next-gen engine for future Elder Scroll and Fallout games.  The second point goes off due to the features that the previous Fallout got right and Bethesda removed in an attempt to copy Bioware (and for the life of me, I will never understand). I am talking about the godforsaken, awful, hateful dialog wheel for idiots (I despise it with all my heart and what it represents) and the lack of the karma wheel which really helped you choose an angel or devil path in the Wasteland (were they emulating Dragon Age???). The dialog wheel actually lowers your IQ, and as the Witcher has proved, it is not even necessary for full speech to your character. Honestly, Ultima IV had better dialog options 30 years ago with ""Name"", ""Job"" and ""Bye"".  All in all, this game is totally worth it for Bethesda fans and people looking for a fun, and immersive action RPG. If Call of Duty, Destiny and or SW:Battlefront are your thing, this game will probably bore you and look like it was from 3 years ago.… Expand "

Many people will see just how refreshing and different it is compared to older titles and be delighted. Many will have a knee-jerk ""Pepperidge farm remembers when an RPG would kick you in the balls for no reason"" reaction.  The irony is that those accusing this game of dumbing down RPGs just haven't put the time in to discover everything Fallout 4 has to offer. There are thousands of stories, ranging from complex ones you have to piece together detective style whilst exploring an entire location, to equally powerful stories told in a single frame. After 150 hours of playing this game, I still haven't discovered them all.  So what has it lost? You can no longer repair weapons, or craft ammo. Instead ammo is scarce, making it foolish to stick to the same gun for any length of time. Karma is gone - no more binary choice between being sickeningly good or hideously evil with no reward for nuance or moral complexity. Instead, your companions react differently to different events. Some like you helping people, others like you stealing. If they like you enough, they will give you a unique perk, giving you a genuine reward for pleasing them.  Conversation options are more limited. Instead, you can only have the same conversation with an NPC once, so no more endlessly trying out different options till you get the result you want. You have to make split second decisions, just like in real life.  Immortal companions - somehow Bethesda decided that constantly reloading the game every time one of the stupid idiots died killed the immersion and made them irritating to the point most people didn't  travel with them at all. If that's your idea of challenging game play then I'd suggest just going the whole hog and taking up self-flagellation.  Here's the big one though: you can't be whatever character you want. You have to be a father or a mother, looking for their son. Some people really don't like this. Instead though, you get a cohesive story, meaningful quests that make you feel invested in completing them and realistic companions and NPCs that react to almost everything you do. Fair trade off I would say. There's no way to make a game this big, and still allow people to play as whoever they want. And is it really that different from most other RPGs? You HAVE to be a amnesiac courier looking for his killers in New Vegas. You HAVE to be the Dragonborn in Skyrim. You HAVE to be a Witcher in the Witcher. How is this any different? Fallout 4 may give you a pretty concrete goal to achieve, but it gives you endless ways to achieve it.  Does it have its problems? Hell yes. Bugs ranging from hilarious to game breaking. But then that's what you get with a game so monstrously big that the world's biggest QA department couldn't possibly find them all. The control system is legitimately awful. Not for moving around, or combat, but for crafting and inventory management. Again, there's just so much you can do, this was bound to happen. You get used to it though. Whilst the settlement building mechanic is revolutionary for an RPG, it is far from perfect and you will need to invest a lot of time to get the hang of it. But a quick Google search will show you what is possible and what others have created, only two weeks after the games release. It also gives you a legitimate reason to collect almost every bit of junk you find. In terms of role playing, searching across an irradiated wasteland for a desk fan just so you can upgrade your rifle is about as immersive as it gets.  So no, this game is not dumbed down. In many ways it is closer to Fallout 2 than Fallout 3 and New Vegas, in terms of how much it expects you to work out on your own. No it is not Call of Duty. Call of Duty fans will likely hate this game for not holding their hand and providing a solid 8 hours of mountain dew fueled racist carnage. But it is different. Those who only want the same classic RPG formula they have experienced a million times before, but on a larger scale will just have to find something else. But those hoping for a game that tries to push the boundaries of the genre rather than slavishly adhere to a tried and tested formula, will find endless novelty, unprecedented freedom and total immersion in a world as beautiful as it is heartrendingly sad.… Expand "

Still, many Bethesda fans or just players who enjoy exploring unfamiliar worlds will be satisfied with it, as it has one of the richest, most detailed game worlds ever created. Lore is presented to the player in different ways around every corner of the game world. Together with the masterfully crafted sound design it will help immerse even newcomers in the interesting world of Fallout. The game also has a lot to offer to gun nuts as the game features improved shooting and an expansive crafting system that takes resources from the clutter in the open world.  However, Fallout 4 is a big departure from the franchise in terms of its way of storytelling and RPG mechanics, which will most likely disappoint long-time fans of the franchise. It is apparent that BGS have taken inspiration from other popular games. It seems to me that in the beginning of the development cycle of the game, the developers asked the question “can we” too many times and didn’t ask the question “should we” enough. As a result the narrative of the game suffers, as the actions of the player often contradict with or completely undermine the meaning of the main story of the game.  For the first time in a Bethesda game, the protagonist is given strictly defining traits that force them to follow a linear path towards an endgame goal. This not only limits the possibilities for role playing, but it creates a pseudo narrative dissonance between the actions that the player makes during the main quests and the rest of their journey in the open world. On one hand the game tries to be an emotional story about family and difficult choices. On the other, it tries to tell a story about hope, building a new healthy community in the post-apocalyptic world. Unfortunately it does not spend enough time on any of these two sides and fails to tell a coherent story as a result of their inability to exist in correlation.  This new way of storytelling is totally uncalled for and it betrays the philosophy of player freedom that BGS has always had. Fallout 4 is a lesser RPG in almost every aspect, even compared to Fallout 3: The removal of the karma system (and the ability to role play as an evil persona); The new “dialogue wheel” which only gives the illusion of choice but ultimately lacks any consequences; The voiced protagonist with defined traits and goals; The removal of skills making your character inexplicably proficient in any kind of weapon and power armor from the very start of the game; The overall lack of choice in quests or the illusion of such. All of these aspects were hallmarks of the franchise and, in my opinion, made the previous Fallout games one of the best RPG games of all time.  Moreover, the quest scripts themselves are repetitive, uninspired and boring. In terms of their mechanics, the quests of Fallout 4 could very well exist in an MMORPG, just in bigger numbers. All quest objectives can be narrowed down to: Acquire X item, place X item, kill X NPC, talk to X NPC, escort X NPC. Inexplicably, 95% of the population of the Commonwealth consists of generic, respawning enemies to kill in an attempt by Bethesda to bring the franchise to the mainstream audience of action hungry FPS players.  The lack of innovation in the mechanics of the game might very well be due to engine limitations. Unsurprisingly, Bethesda decided to use an upgraded version of the engine that they used for Skyrim. This is not the first time that the Fallout franchise receives this kind of treatment as Fallout 3 used an upgraded version of Oblivion's engine. It might have made sense at the time, as Fallout 3 was Bethesda’s first try at the IP and there was a certain amount of risk involved but it cannot be justified after the huge success of both Fallout 3 and Skyrim.  There has been an argument that the team behind these games is considerably small and they like to keep it this way because they are used to working with each other. This is possibly the biggest lie that Bethesda’s PR team has come up with and anyone with even a little knowledge about the game industry can pick it apart. I am totally fine with BGS keeping their artists and world designers and writers as they are. However, the choice by Bethesda not to hire more software engineers and graphics designers is a purely business decision since those types of employees rarely have any influence on the overall theme of the game. It is unforgivable for a AAA title in 2015 to have so many bugs, to look considerably worse than other games that came out in the same year while running poorly. This is not the quality that we should expect from the company behind some of the best selling games of the decade. As long as the community shows that they are willing to forgive poor mechanics, ugly, not optimized textures and game breaking bugs, BGS will keep releasing games in an unfinished state.… Expand "

Fallout 3 was released 7 years ago while Fallout: New Vegas was released 5 years ago. Having played both games in the past I was expecting 5 years to give the game new life with many new things to do but this is where Fallout 4 falls especially short.  Fallout 4 is almost identical to Fallout 3 in every way besides a housing system that this game introduced. The main difference is the graphics which doesn't cut it for many people. As always Bethesda's games are filled with both game breaking and simply immersive breaking bugs at launch that the community will have to fix on their own.  This brings me to their mod-system. Bethesda has been incredibly lazy this time to fix small errors in the game that anyone can spot through playing the game. The way Bethesda handles this with their given release date for the game is that they simply give the community the tools they need to correct the errors that Bethesda made. This is an incredibly cheap way of solving problems given how large of a budget this company has for making games, which is one my viewpoints when I'm making the final score.  The gameplay is very repetitive with most quest involving ""Get to X and bring back Y"". The combat which is arguably the most important part of an RPG shooter is identical to Fallout 3, which is undeniably very dated at this point.  The graphics on par with similar games released in 2015 given that your PC is powerful enough to run it on high settings. The game isn't very optimized on PC at the moment which often causes even the most powerful gaming PC's to drop heavily in framerates at times.  Although Fallout 4 some parts of its soundtrack from previous games it overall has a superb soundtrack. The music feels carefully placed and does a good job of setting the right tone for the given situation.  The story is what you would expect from a modern Fallout game. It has some memorable characters and while the main quest is almost always the weakest part of the story there are some parts that are really memorable, but still quite few in regard to how many quests there are.  Summary: Fallout 4 is a very bad sequel to Fallout 3 that was released in 2007. It doesn't bring many new things to the table and its gameplay doesn't line up with its competitors. Anyone can play the game for around 10 hours and make a huge list of things that could've been fixed prior to the game's launch. I think it's arrogant of Bethesda to expect the community to fix their problems that they without a doubt has noticed themselves.  If you're new to the Fallout series or RPG's in general I have faith that you will enjoy the game very much where you might even give it a 9/10 or 10/10. If you're a seasoned player you'll likely find this game to be incomplete in several ways and you'd do best to either rent the game or wait for the game to receive the mod support it currently needs to add to the depth of the game, and frankly speaking fix this broken game.  5/10… Expand "

Some of the animations are janky. Some low resolution textures. Companion ai and path finding. Dialog options and ui. Performance in built up areas.

Choices could affect the world more, but it's not really a big deal.  The settlement building is awesome. It sort of takes what was started in Skyrim's Heartstone DLC and makes it much much richer and more complex. That was my favorite part of Skyrim and I'm sure building homes and settlements will be my favorite part of FO4.  Gameplay is as you should expect it to be. It's not quite an FPS and it's not quite an RPG, but straddles the median well. The soundtrack is absolutely stunning. The crafting is incredibly deep. And the world is beautiful. I really do feel like I'm scavenging in a wasteland to get my settlement ready, and that's absolutely amazing to me.

I stop regularly to enjoy the scenes. Something like that i had with like 100 mods installed on the previous games. The sounds are superb, everything just fits here. The Powerarmor steps, the rain on the rooftops inside buildings, the weapons particularly the laser sounds, the announcements in subway stations and so on... really good.

Everything is possible and some traits are now build into the perks... so you didn't loose them.  You can clearly see how Bethesda has taken a lot of ideas from the modding scene and Fallout 4 really benefits form it! I just love the way you can mod your weapons and armor and that the power armor is becoming something like a ""vehicle"" which needs ""fuel"". It feels just right and is set up perfectly immersive. Just go on a diving run with your power armor, it's amazing. And i'm really happy that they finally got a spot flashlight! That's one thing that bothered me in the previous games. Now you have really creepy experiences.  Sure it's not all perfect... the dialog system could have needed more attention. But i can live with that.

First being that I hope this game opens up later on with new lore and enemies.  I say this because within about 3 hours of playing I've already fought every enemy from previous fallout games, I've been recruited into what has been the most secret of societies (the one you might find 70% into New Vegas, I have a set of power armor (FROM MY FIRST MISSION), a minigun, a missile launcher, a fat man, a junk shooter, a syringe rifle, and almost everything I had at the end of New Vegas. This both worries me and excites me. Worried because I'm afraid I've already seen everything already; excited because there's so much more of this game to go and I'm hoping they've added some new lore/enemies.  My biggest complaint is that I feel like I'm playing a written story instead of creating my own. From the start you become the general of the minute men and start building settlements. This is a cool feature, but I didn't really have a choice. I have yet to be faced with difficult decisions, like blowing up or saving Megaton, siding with slavers or wiping them out, joining the NCR, MR house, Caesar's Legion, or yourself. It's very clear who the good guys are and who the bad guys are and you're the good guy.  Settlements take savaging and crafting to a whole new level. Part good part bad.  Good because there is so much you can do with settlements and it's a lot of fun playing with the robust building options (forcing you to keep enough beds, food, power, water, defense, and electricity; all while bringing in new members).  Bad because literally everything has a purpose. You won't be sifting through loot to find goodies, you'll be picking up everything that's not bolted down, trying to keep enough oil, copper, steel, ceramic, fiber optics, wood, plastic, acid, concrete, rubber, circuitry, glass, crystals, aluminum, nuclear material.... (it's a bit overwhelming and leaves you more excited to find a microscope or a lighter than a new weapon). You can assign settlers to scavenge for you, but because what they find will be deposited into your workplace bench, you'll never know if they're even finding anything let alone what.  Some skills are forced open you. If you want to build settlements, you will need 6 charisma in order to activate the perk that allows you to set up trade routes and build merchants .Trade routes are not an option they are a necessity.  The combat is more fluid and a lot of fun. Weapon customization can turn a pipe pistol (10 to 13 damage using .38 rounds) into a .45 cal headspliter with a 45 round drum (24+ damage). You will still find legendary items that add a special ability (my favorite so far is a shoulder piece that slows time when I reach 20 health and the ax that knocks enemies down for an easy finish).  It's cool how you shape the world in an effort to build the minute men (you even get a flair gun that calls reinforcements if they're near by). It's just too bad that I had no choice in the matter.  While I miss the freedom of the last 2 games, I am having a blast with F4. To everyone complaining about graphics, the game looks great on ultrra settings (it's not 4k but still looks great) and wait a month and you can install all the texture packs you want.  Though this review has been on the critical side, I still give this game a 9 and would recommend it.… Expand "

They are especially enough for one of the best parts of the game: The Atmosphere. It's really amazing how the dynamic weather really manages to change your mood. For example standing on a high place while a radiation storm takes place and just watching the streets feels just so epic that you could forget that this is not part of a cinematic, but actually a dynamic part of the game.  Most of the quests are great too, even the plain ""fetch something for me"" quests mostly have a rather well thought out and unique backstory. I think I never had more fun in a videogame than in the questline about the Silver Shroud. In this game you really enjoy to read all the notes you find and talk about everything with the involved characters. The voiced protagonist actually helps in this because it makes the dialogues so much more lively. Although I can understand why some people might not like the summary based system, which is not very clear at times. For example at one instance there was the option just labeled ""Violence"" and it wasn't sure if that meant to ask the other character why he is so violent or to resort to violence yourself. Meant to do the former but it turned out to be the latter. Glad I saved beforehand.  Can't say much about the settlement system, because that seems to be more like endgame content. But the weapon crafting system is really fun and intuitive too. It even makes the scavenging useful and exciting, which was just a pain in Fallout 3. Now you can give your favourite weapon a name and watch it grow with you over the course of the game instead of tossing it away once you find a better alternative.  All in all I would dare to call this game a masterpiece. Maybe not from a technical standpoint but for sure from an artistic one. And that's what really matters in a game like this.

There were a lot of complaints about Fallout 4 which I can't agree completely. I think lots of players hate Fallout 4 because they're expecting a better version of Fallout 3 with all Fallout 3 features included.  For those that are open-minded and ready for new different type of role play games Fallout 4 would be a very good choice! So lets take a look at the most common criticizied topics  1. Old karma system is gone -> a new one is on its way: Yes, the old karma system isn't the same anymore. In Fallout 4 it's a little bit hidden. The descisions you take play a hidden role within the story line and the behaviour and interactions with the npcs.  2. Repair Mode of Weapons is gone -> but modification of weapons and armor is increased : The old repair mode was redeveloped into the new modification system and crafting mechanics. Instead of 'weapons are bad because they broke' the concept of 'weapons are bad because they aren't strong enough'  3. No seperate Skills, Perks and Skills were fusioned -> is that really true? I think thats too fluffy. The Perk system is similar to Fallout 3. You need to increase your S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes first to get the better Perks. Only difference: Perks and Attributes are melted into one menu/ grafic. In my opinion thats perfectly arranged to get a better overview about your characters skill matrix.  4. Role Play Gameing is shrinked to a minimum ->  its well balanced The role play gaming in Fallout 4 is compromised to the point. You've got dialogs, you've got a skilling system. The drifference is, that the role play game is more group oriented. Its more about building up your character through interactions with npcs and clans.  5. The crafting and the colony system is difficult to handle and useless -> but minecraft nerds will love it Seriously, the best moment in Fallout 4 I had so far was discovering the crafting mechanics by randomness. You are able to collect all that crap from the wastelands and use it to build up your own base incl. npcs! If you ever dreamed about cleaning up Fallout 3 and building up your own estate to show and store your valueable weapons and amor - then I have to say your dreams come true!  6. time in V.A.T.S. mode progresses -> [._°] whats new about this? I think the time in V.A.T.S. mode also progressed in Fallout 3. I don't know if it was in the main game or if it was a game mod, but I don't see that big disadvantage about this. The only thing to mention is, that speed the time in V.A.T.S mode is progressing increases the difficulty of the game. And thats a plus for advanced gamers  7. the dialog system is simplified -> hell yeah, I love it Honestly I love this feature. I remember how often I clicked away every dialog in fallout 3, because every the NPCs said was ther in the text box. Bethesda decide to remove this redundancy. Very good choice in my case. Also the dynamic camera in dialogs increases the game feeling.  8. Flat story, lame dialogs, bad voice acting -> didn't recognized that I've played the german version of the game so far and have to say that its flawless. But we will see...  9. Graphics are bad -> ... well actually thats a point I agree The graphics are little bit better than in Fallout 3. But the compositum of everything fits perfectly together. And who knows... maybe there is a graphic update patch on its way ;)  Also I was very impressed of the detailled character creator. I've never saw I better one. I also like the weather system very much, which creates a very apokalypsed athmosphere. And Soundtrack is awesome too...  To conclude:  In my opinion the best game so far. If you love sand box gaming with role play charakter such as crafting and colony system  then Fallout 4 will cost you a lot of free time hours ;)… Expand "

I'm running it on medium on a slightly above-minimum spec'd GPU but the world looks great, the places are unique enough and are now filled with stuff. Unfortunately, the game has limited support for 4:3 aspect ration and I have to run it in a window (otherwise the UI gliches). I experienced frame drops when enemies are numerous, the environment too complex or having too much fire around me. The UI is acceptable and finally I can use the key E to accept a dialog (which requires a mod in Skyrim?!). I also like the fonts are big and the environments are bright (unlike Witcher 3 where I once failed to exit an Inn because I couldn't locate door in the darkness).  The economy seems to be scaled back, armor and weapons sell for tens of caps. When I clear out a location, it yields only about 400-900 caps which I usually spend on ammunition and relatively expensive Rad-Away. However, about 20 hours into the game and with the right perks, ammo won't be an issue anymore. Big positive property is that crafting has now real impact; I pretty much liked improving my armor and weapons and cook my food and investing in the associated perks proven to be rewarding. In addition, cooking now removes rad from the food, however, I don't think classical food such as Pork'n'Beans can be cleaned this way and as such are now useless to me at this point.  In previous games, you had to earn the right to use a Power Armor whereas here you get it as part of the main quest. This may seem odd and non rewarding but I think the game is balanced around it acceptably. It runs on fusion cores which are rare so you won't try to use it all the time except in hairy situations. For example, I run into a pack of Super Mutants of which 1-2 were way over my level. Returning with a Power Armor leveled the field nicely.  I don't mind the radiant quests either because of the XP reward helps reaching the next level much quicker. Otherwise, I didn't invest to much in the main quest line so far so I can prepare myself for it (hope it doesn't level enemies). Indeed, side quests so far are a bit uninspired: kill or fetch, not boring but not exciting to me either.  One negative thing about how the first few hours and levels I've spent is the fear of the environment. You are at a low level with simple guns with which you can't properly hit a Bloatfly or a Ghoul running at you 2x as fast than in FO3. I was afraid to take any of the starting quests because of the ""show-off"" with the Power Armor in the beginning: what if I run into a pack of Supermutants or Deathclaw with my little pistol? If an early quest sends you across the map, who nows what the intended levels are? But one has to go out to get XP to get perks to be able to upgrade stuff and once I got over the start, now I'm more confident and whenever I see some location, I go in without any fear by now (and get back in a Power Armor if necessary).  Given the new dialog wheel, I liked the previous list-based conversations (modded to show more lines) better as I find it a bit difficult to hit those small arrows on screen (are there keys for those?). Big positive thing that you don't have to open the transfer dialog (which was becoming quite slow to show up in FO3 and FNV) for containers but just point at them and loot them directly and immediately.  I haven't experienced any quest/game breaking bugs yet but had plenty of the ordinary bugs: Pip-boy and weapons invisible, stuck in rubble, CTD. Enemy pathing is sometimes buggy and they get stuck on things (which of course makes them easier to kill).  Perhaps the worst technical problem I'm facing is the loading time when fast traveling or entering/exiting a building. It can take up to a half a minute until the game loads up despite it runs on a 500MB/s SSD. I know this game is like 4-5x of Skyrim but Skyrim transitions rarely take 2-3 seconds on the same SSD. (I utilize this time to check my emails and social network sites...).  Bottom line is that this game is indeed more intended towards those kinds of people who want to experience a game without limits in a streamlined fashion (i.e., who have a daily job and/or family) and don't really want to spend time on too many branches and replays.… Expand "

Two: the gamers leaving complaints about glitches and graphics that justify a rating of six or seven, but they leave it a zero instead. Think about the scale of what you're doing before you do it. Does the community really think this game is on par with Ride to Hell Retribution, Big Rigs, or E.T.?  Fallout 4's community ratings are an atrocity and I will never trust this system again. Now for the review. World: Fallout 4, to me, represents freedom of choice, maybe not to be able to respond with a variety of things, but to be who you want morally. The faction system left me satisfied with my ending, and with a feeling of uniqueness like I shaped my world. The graphics are stylized and done well aside from some texture issues, but there are games held on pedestals despite having the same, if not worse of an issue there. The interactions and companion system feel real and, surprisingly, I prefer the voiced protagonist over the previous quiet ones. Overall, I would not go back to an earlier world system and I'm saying that having played through Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Gameplay: The gunplay is a remarkable improvement, as is expected with the amount of time between Fallout 3 and 4, and the two best words to describe it are modern and fulfilling. Every gun has a unique feeling and purpose and everything functions so fluidly; better so than you'd expect of a game of this scale. The crafting system compliments the scaling of the game and it's rewarding. You won't want to stop crafting until you're in the best gear in the game, which takes tens of hours to accomplish. The settlement building aspect is a fun side-project that will take up a few hours and you'll be rewarded with random or induced Minutemen ambushes in the real game world, along with some resource production and shops. The economy is as good as its ever been, but, like always, there are exploits. To summarize, the gameplay simple doesn't get old. I speculate that, before it does, I'll run out of places to explore, and we all know that these games have insane amounts of that. Summary: Why should Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain be let off with a lacking story, but Fallout 4 is so harshly critisized for solely its voice system's role in that, despite having a far superior and deep story. Why should The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess be massively acclaimed despite having textures that are way after its time but Fallout 4 be scrutinized for the occasional muckup in a massive world? Fallout 4 has been meticulously crafted to offer over 100 hours of entertainment, yet the majority of its players get hung up on the small stuff. If we let it, Fallout 4 could be the next half-a-month-straight of entertainment that it was meant to be, but half of the playerbase seems to disagree on loose grounds.… Expand "

I question whether if the people who gave bad reviews have played more than 20 hours. If game should be judged based on the first ten hours, then I'd agree with the bad reviews.  All in all, the first  15 hours was bad experience for me and could easily point out the negatives comparing to other triple A RPG games.

A PC port lacking fundamental options (I had to edit 2 separate .ini files to change the FOV and turn off Mouse Acceleration), a UI optimized for consoles, and a LOT of bugs all try desperately to make it so you won't have a good time. In my first 6 hours of play, I lost at least an hour of progress due to a mixture of bugs that locked up the game (always quicksave before using a terminal), and a horribly sporadic autosaving system. Additionally, the movement feels extremely dated. The AP you use to activate VATS also serves as a stamina meter that you use up while running (a la Skyrim). That's right, a stamina meter that gates how long you can run, in an open world game where 90% of your time is going to be spent running. I didn't like the mechanic in Skyrim, and I like it even less now.  But despite all of that, I find myself about 10 hours in, and wanting to play more of it, once I finish writting this review. The fundamental exploration is solid, the crafting system is interesting, and actually gives me a justification to pick up literally everything I possibly can, and the settlement system seems to have a decent amount of potential. The shooting is actually serviceable, compared to Fallout 3, but you'll still likely find yourself going into VATS on certain enemies with erratic movement patterns to try and conserve ammo.  Basically, I think that if you didn't like Fallout 3, there's almost no way you'll like Fallout 4. If you wanted to like Fallout 3, but couldn't because of the shooting mechanics/VATS, then you'll probably have a good time here. If you loved Fallout 3, and want more, then this is the game for you, but just know what you're getting yourself into. This is not a perfect game, or even a fantastic game in the year 2015, despite what many reviewers have said. Go back to 2011 or 2008, and my opinion would likely be different, but in 2015 I think this is a really solid exploration FPS/RPG with a lot of problems. If you're on the fence about this game, then don't get it now. I don't think I'd have a hard time recommending the game for $40, but $60 is just a bit steep (imo) for how many problems it has… Expand "

Seriously, get a life.  I also do not agree with all the 0's and hateful comments from players who supposedly own the game.  Ratings are used for comparative purposes, and to give a game a zero rating is to imply it's the worst game you've ever played - which frankly when said about a Fallout title is just stupid.  That being said I will say that I was giddy with anticipation when this game was announced and couldn't wait for the day it came out.  Even getting into it, I really liked it.  Sure I immediately felt that it was perhaps not as grand as advertised, but still pretty ambitious.  So I started exploring, gearing, building, scrapping, all the good stuff Fallout offered.  For a time it was fun.  I even went out and bought a brand new graphics card and a 2k gsync monitor to enjoy the game better.  But then all of a sudden I lost interest, not sure how or why, though I do have my suspicions now that I think about it.  Here's what I think went wrong 1. The game - quickly I realized that this was a Fallout 3 do-over.  Not to insult the game but even F3 was a bit hollow for me.  Perhaps because each game tries to remake F1 and F2 as opposed to doing something different.  Yes the locations are new, but the progression feels weird and well, the shiny factor gets quickly lost when you know what the next upgrade will be (pistol, smg, shotgun, laser pistol, plasma rifle, etc., you get the jist).  So like someone else wrote, it was an odd feeling of de-ja vu, but not in a good way.  The other thing that failed to captivate me was the story.  It felt incohesive and rather bland.  I get that Bethesda tried to draw some powerful emotions with the start of the game - the baby being taken, the parent shot (sorry spoilers but it's been out for a while).  As a new parent that struck a cord with me.  But then it was quickly forgotten and when it came up again I found myself telling my character - guess what, you've been frozen, your kid is probably an old man, get over it and move on.  Somehow these 2 parts of the premise really clashed for me (frozen for 200 years and emerging into a completely different world, and oh-noes my baby is kidnapped). 2. The mods - so with all the initial hype that followed the release of F4, quickly news spread about the community mods for the game.  One thing led to another and quickly I found myself with a couple of inocent enough mods (weather, texture, etc) and then boom - unlimited power armor mod and max SPECIAL exploit.  I could've resisted, but the temptation was too great.  Next thing I know I'm a super badass babe (ditched my guy after the newly discovered exploit) pew-pewing my way through anything in sight.  Deathclaw, whaat - 2 shotgun blasts to da face and bye bye. You get the gist.  What I had inadvertently done is killed the fun of combat.  So then what was left was exploration and story, and guess what we're back at problem #1.  My own fault though for cheating in the game - back in Doom 2 days I promised myself to never cheat, hack or otherwise try to manipulate game mechanics because it just strips away all the fun of trying to survive, beating the odds, being ""good"".  So, lesson learned.  When all is said and done, I keep thinking of going back and finishing Fallout 4 but I just can't prioritize it high enough with the limited amount of time I have to play these days.  And if I do, can I really live without my power armor and max special? Probably not, now that I have a taste for it.  So what's the bottom line here.  Perhaps it's that Bethesda tried too hard to capitalize on a cult franchise by giving the fans what they think they would want - an open world sandbox, flying limbs and full mod capability.  Perhaps it's that they keep trying to recapture the magic of F1 and especially F2, but let's face it - you can't discover the moon twice, once you've discovered it you know it's there.  So either build a moon base or go find another moon (like Phobos - hint, hint)  Anyway, a great game that I really want to give a 10/10 and I would if I never played F1,2,3 and NV.… Expand "

God it's PSOne quality textures. And when you're out in open world prepare your fps to drop to the single numbers. Seriously, it almost froze my PC (and I'm with a 980 GTX Ti here). - Even thought some quests are fun, the game becomes really repetitive after some time.

The biggest flaw is the leveling system/character adjustments, a major downgrade from previous games in the series, where the 'skills' have been completely removed and replaced with more perks, including 'tiers' of perks to accomplish what skills once did; instead of having skills in lockpicking, you need to buy levels of the lockpicking perk. In addition, level gates on these 'skills' mean that you cannot focus on sneaking, or shooting, or bargaining, for the first few levels to attain mastery; you have to be a jack of all trades.  Overall; flawed but okay. New Vegas and Fallout 2 are still my favorite games in the series. This may change as DLC and mods come out.… Expand "
TromboneSteve,"Nov 10, 2015",7," I'm enjoying the game. I recommend getting a console version of the game because the PC version has a lot of technical issues. My biggest issues with the game so far are: The X and Y sensitivities are different and cannot be changed independently. I don't even want to look up or down because of the excessive mouse movements required. After I use any computer terminal I can't move and II'm enjoying the game.

There's some weird mouse smoothing and acceleration thing going on. There's no FOV slider, and the default FOV is low. I don't mind the look of the graphics, but how can framerates be so low compared to games that look way better? There needs to be more useful keybind options. Also, you can't re-bind the dialogue keys.  While I have enjoyed the game so far, the poor implementation as a PC game just leaves a bad taste in my mouth while I'm exploring the wastelands.

People that cry about it being a Skyrim with guns and **** obviously are the new brand of dumb Skyrim players that haven't played any other Bethesda games before that. The game is what you'd expect, I got to the place where I can ask someone ""Super mutants? What are those?"" but I already killed 200 of them, because I explored so much more before just rushing to the main quest. I might say it's not completely worth the price, but which game besides Attila Total War and Witcher 3 were worth the full price this year? So just get it on a sale. If 60 euro was for the whole game, DLC included then yes.  Still, don't buy into these butthurt reviews, the game works at 60+ fps on a 980Ti and an old i7 CPU and I'm not even trying. I have barely seen any bugs or glitches. I'd give it a 9 because I'm not a great fan of shooter-RPG games and because the dialogue could've been much better but a 10 might even the scales a little more considering how many idiots gave it a ridiculous grade.… Expand "

MAINSTORY: This game has a great main story line actually the best one Bethesda has ever made. CRAFTING:  There is crafting, customization of amour and guns like you would not believe this is a truly perfect system that allow you to be who you want to be. BUILDING: The settlement buildingBest game I have ever played. People these days are just so demanding in games and can never be happy. MAINSTORY: This game has a great main story line actually the best one Bethesda has ever made. CRAFTING:  There is crafting, customization of amour and guns like you would not believe this is a truly perfect system that allow you to be who you want to be. BUILDING: The settlement building is my favorite part it even gives Minecraft a run for it's money and they give you so many options and settlements to take ownership of and if you don't manage the settlers they will leave. They also provide support to you in the wastes like flare signals to alert the minutemen you are in need of help or providing artillery support for you it's an amazing system that really makes you feel like you are in control and have to work to have a successful Clan. GRAPHICS: The graphics have been controversial between gamers but in my eyes they are step in the right direction for Bethesda I never once felt like they were bland or boring, the game really has a great color and feel to it. SHOOTING MACHANICS: Oh boy they are greatly improved in Fallout 4, never once did I grow tired of shooting people because the gore and V.A.T.S system is so well done. SIDE QUESTS/ WORLD: Fallout 4 has the best map Bethesda has made yet. It may look small but it is very dense and unique, every area is interesting with some story to tell or a fight breaking out or maybe someone in distress. The side quests are fun and often more fun then main story quests with tons and tons of them this game is almost endless. DIALOUGE: The dialogue system worried me at first with there only being 4 options and a few words to predict what you charter would say but I almost liked it more then the old dialogue system in Fallout 3 because I don't have to scroll and read different options for half a minute, never once did I choose an option and the charter not say what I thought or wanted him to say. CONS: On the PS4 and Xbox 1 the frame rate dips when you go into the main downtown city but it's they are not   extreme just enough for you to notice them. However when you are out of the downtown city the frame rate is a solid 30 even when in combat for the most part but I am sure Bethesda will patch it for better performance. Now I am a console gamer but I noticed that on PC the game still had multiple use keys so it made for frustrating moments when you would try to loot something and instead throw grenade. OVERALL: Overall Bethesda really hot home base with this one its very challenging I have died over 40 times just on normal mode and the game has a great main story, great gunplay, on par graphics, great voice acting and over all an amazing game with a few minor FPS problems and PC configuration problems that will hopefully get patched soon. 10/10… Expand "

You may think they're cliched but the reality is, there's some rather inspired writing involved here. The visuals are great, not astounding but certainly a leap forward. There are occasions where the immersion is lost, things like hanging vines and some of the floral textures are grainy and weak but overall the graphics are decent. The game runs well on ultra, there are frame rate dips on occasion but nothing that ruins the experience. I'm not the type that demands 60fps at all times.  The mouse acceleration was a mistake from Bethesda - as was the FOV but they're editable if you find the .ini files. Not something you should have to do, but bear in mind we have had a game delivered we didn't really expect in a short time frame. Expecting absolute perfection is juvenile.  I'm a fan of the series, found myself enjoying the outcomes of the missions, the visuals are strong without being game changing, the sounds are good - usual Bethesda bugs such as raining cars, companion blocking and people walking away when talking to them about the mission, but overall a good solid game.… Expand "

The story is again good, maybe great, but not excellent. There's a few plot twists that I didn't see coming which was a nice surprise, and they didn't seem tacky. The gameplay itself was fun, I sunk 50 hours into it before I finished the game story and started to get a little bit over it. The settlement building is a brilliant idea, but the execution leaves a bit to be desired. Most of these problems can be fixed by modders and bethesda patches so I give it a solid 8 despite all these mostly minor flaws.  Worth playing, but don't set your expectations too high.

It is not as good as people hoped but it is definitely not a dog or an abomination. Wait until the GOTY comes out or it is a bit too expensive at this time (November).  I am up to about 10 hours of gameplay, and 2/3rds through the story. I backlashed against the backlash against this game, which is partly a reaction to the overhyping of the title and the disappointment felt by fans. Personally, this is a better title than Dishonored which I feel IS overrated, and while Its definitely not a better title than FNV (Fallout New Vegas) or Fallout 3 I think it's debatable to say that it is worse.  First:  A lot of the irritation caused (myself included) against the game are because of the bugs, the poor UI and some of the banal dialogue. I don't dispute any of this although the bugs will fly off over time and the UI will hopefully be modded quite soon.  Features: The storyline is decent. Is it replayble? Well maybe once, giving two run throughs but there are additional areas of exploration and hidden easter eggs.  The world is nice, on my value for money machine, I enjoy running around looking at funguses and getting attacked by glow in the dark mole-rats. There are some nice touches like a garden run by gardening robots.  There are in-depth interesting characters, and the AI on companions works reasonably well. Most of the companions are more interesting than Skyrims, which were particularly bland but less interesting than for instance, Mass Effect, FNV, or more character rich RPGs.  You...get used to the lack of skills, the poster with the perks is sort of un-needed. Like Skyrim, you aren't tied to particular builds but that also means that there is a bit of a 'meh' feeling with character development, it is like there is really only one character anyway, be it the male or female protagonist.  The customization on weapons - one of the lauded features. It's actually irrelevant. They drop so often you don't need to craft, and as you don't need to craft, why bother. Similar to Skyrim you can invest your time in this or just look for legendary weapons one of which you see at the start but can't access. Again, the fact that the choice doesn't matter means that having an open choice is kind of ruined, if the choice is of no consequence.  The base building. I saw this and went, ""yup, minecraft"". I have Subnautica which I prefer and haven't tried this feature...because I don't care. I may try it on a replay. So far I haven't needed it for the storyline.  Puzzles, challenges; Navigating some of the buildings is interesting, in a FPS way, in terms of puzzles about the hardest is mixing green paint (it's yellow and blue kiddies). They do indeed feel dumbed down.  Conclusion: People that like FPS with role-playing elements will probably like this, people without pre-conceived notions (i.e. new to Fallout universe). Hardcore role-playing types, fanatics, probably move along. I fall in-between. Enjoyable but I too could've pictured a better sequel.… Expand "

ValueI've been reading quite a few ""User reviews"" on Metacritic.com for Fallout 4 and I can't help but feel the need to defend Fallout 4, because I found the user opinions on this particular game are ridiculous and unwarranted.  First off I would like to note that i've put about 100 hours on the game and can safely say that this game deserves to be recognized for its ambitiousness.  Value of the game: I can understand in some cases why some people don't get the hype surrounding the game when they have not yet played past the introduction and put at least 5 hours into the world of fallout 4. The creators were smart about not presenting all the features and content of the game up front, they allow the player to discover it all for the first time on their own.  Believe me there is more then meets the eye when it comes to what this game really offers.   Some game developers like to tease everything you can do within the marketing of the game and when it comes to actually playing the game it can leave the player a little underwhelmed. but Bethesda on the other hand takes the risk of players missing out on certain content in the game and allows the player to discover it all on their own time, this makes for a more surprising game, full of content and things to discover.  I'm 100% sure that the reason why people are so unimpressed with the game is because they have not played enough of the game yet to realize how massive it is.  Graphics: I have to admit the graphics are clearly running on an older engine. However the Lighting and Shadow effects make up for lost detail and I prefer the artsy style over realism if it means It will run great on my machine. That being said, does it really matter that much when all the game-play mechanics are improved and run just fine.  Story: When people say that the story is no good, I have no idea what they are referring too, because Ive encountered plenty of story character stuff in the game and I can honestly say the dialog and characters are some of the best i've ever seen in a game. I'm always excited to find the next quest characters, because the quality in writing and story is engaging.  Gameplay: This is not Call of duty, so you shouldn't be expecting a fast paced shooter like that.  This is an Action RPG and a very good one at that.  I my self could not even begin to complain about the gameplay and anything else ive talked about thus far..  My one complaint is that there are some random bugs that bother me, like my companion sometimes require a little more then a simple command to get them to go where I want, but these kinds of things can be fixed through patches.  Over all experience of the game after 100 hours is that I think Fallout 4 will go down in history as one of the greatest open world RPG's ever made.  If I had one thing to say to those who gave the game a 0 rating, which is just stupid to begin with is that they should really give the game another shot because the game is slow to open up to you.  also post your reviews after you have finished the bloody game.… Expand "

Overall, this is STILL a great game! And in many ways its an improved version of Fallout 3. Its addictive, the looting is faster, and there are numerous subtle improvements. But the dumbed down dialogue system and the general lack of new systems, (the lock picking, hacking is virtually the same) makes the game feel too familiar is some ways, and lacks the awe inspiring freshness that was present when Fallout 3 released.

This allows you to create characters that feel unique even early on. -VATS combat: it enjoyed a makeover and is much more useful now. Lots of perk support.  Cons  -optimization: given the unspectacular graphical fidelity, the performance is generally too low. There are extreme slowdowns in certain areas where you wouldn't expect it.  -controls: by default the mouse sensitivity is considerably higher when moving the mouse horizontally than vertically. This however can be fixed by tweaking an ini file. Incredibly low ADS sensitivity, with no option to customize it. No ADS toggle. Cannot bind functions to the numerical keypad. Hotkeys are remappable but retain the original mapping in certain cases.  -UI: very obviously designed with a controller in mind. When using a mouse, the UI is cumbersome and inconsistent. Mousewheel can scroll through items in some screens, but not others (ie. works when looting items, but not in the pipboy inventory). Favorites bar uses WASD hotkeys for navigation but doesn't pause the game, meaning you can't flee from NPCs whilst fumbling for a mine or some other favorited item. Even rotating items during loading screens is limited with the mouse, as the invisible cursor quickly hits the edge of the screen and the rotation stops even though you're still moving the mouse.  -dialogue: the voiced protagonist is weakly implemented. Dialogue choices are too terse and often do a poor job at hinting what the PC is going to say, leaving the player feeling even more disconnected from his character. Some lines are reproducibly cut-off or spoken with no lip-sync.  IMO, this is the worst game BGS have ever released. It is extremely rough around the edges, and does not have the charm of their previous titles; instead, it is a mash-up of ideas taken from other popular games rather than a coherent design. If I had to sum up the game with one word, it would be mediocre.

The story is not the greatest I'll admit, but I prefer it to Fallout 3 in that regard.  The fact that they give you a preset, pre voiced character was also a bit worrying, until I started to treat it as more of a CRpg, then it made sense and I grew to like the character that you play, while still having freedom to make your own choices.  Gunplay is massively improved, and the weapon and armor customisation is great.  The settlement management is new and a great deal of fun, it's great to see your own little version of shady sands grow into a thriving settlement.  The world map is a bit small, but it makes up for it by being superbly detailed.  This is also the only modern Fallout to do power armor right, in the first 2 it was big and bulky and made the wearer 7 feet tall, it felt imposing, in Fallout 4 they manage to get it perfect.

This is fallout for the Middle East, afraid to offend anyone or challenge anyone with strong interesting characters behaving in character in a setting of this time. It is like global nuclear war never happened and I just popped into town for a Cappucino.   I think this fear of doing anything at all for offending anyone at all (the ladies in this game either look like they are just going to church or are the children of good people being a little bit rebellious. Hardly the aftermath of generations of struggle in a post nuclear world   Sure people do shoot at you a bit but even that is so random that there is nothing to connect with or make you care.  It is hard to put a finger on it but the game feels smaller in 2015 (though the total KM simulated may even be the same as FO3 (which I also thought was too small) but it feels smaller in 2015 when I was expecting, more and bigger.  OK.  Lets get the obvious ou This engine /  environment does feel quite dated now and I think it is time for a new engine.  Physics does weird stuff, quest dialogues are fiddly and can be easily bugged.  Many people report performance issues but personally, I haven't had any (playing on a machine with multiple Titan X's however, SLI is not engaged as it is not an option and I havent yet been running it on my Gsynch enabled 144hz monitor.  There are a lot of reports at massive bugging at ""high"" frame rates. Coming from a console background, that could be any number of hz from 1980 on to the present day as TVs have not changed much in this regard. .  Not going to list all of the bugs here, suffice to say, there are a huge amount.  It is fallout after all, much of the game is based upon getting through a section without a bug stopping you or saving enough in different saves so you dont have to start out again.  Keybinding is a notable disaster.. AI - erm, what AI? It can barely get enemies through a building from one side to the other, forget the need for any clever strategy here.  It is as dated as the rest of the engine.  Let us be honest though, we bought this knowing that Bethesda have not been able to make a game for PC for a decade.  So no wonder their engine seems frozen in time as that is the nature of the dinosaurs it has to run with.  So, why am I still not unhappy?  Modding is still wide open. So while Bethesda cant actually put together a bug free game they have enabled another world builder that is pretty accessible for those  with the will to make it alright.  Fix the fps limit, fix the field of view, upgrade the graphics, add content and textures and it starts to come together.  One of the few really tangible and interesting additions is settlement building and development.  It is an extremely welcome addition though it doesn't have a much to it as I would like and feels half implemented.  and seems to have been implemented in a hurry.  For example, the options to build anything bespoke involves some very clumsy components from a few very limited choices greatly limiting your creativity. However, I suspect modders are already hard at work, potentially making this a much deeper addition to the game that at first appears.  Fully voiced dialogue.  For me, it doesn't add anything to the game in terms of immersion but I know many people found it odd that it was never in Fallout 3 so I suppose it is a matter of taste.  It looks as though the Fallout series has run out of Steam. *no pun intended, oh ok,  just a little one.… Expand "

Pro's (8/10) - Graphics are good for the engine and they are not too demanding even on mh GT 630 2 GB DDR3 card at a modified Ultra. - Storyline while spaced out is decent, and there is plenty to explore and discover as well as a lot of side quests. - Crafting system and settlement building system are great additions, and I think they nabbed some of the people who worked on New Vegas for the crafting system. - Interactions are more human and the animations are far better than previous games. - Power armor, it works so much better and feels much more realistic than before. - Weapon and armor variety, and armor system. - Map, size is nice and locations are really well placed. - Gunplay, much improved and more intuitive. - AI enemy tactics, they are smarter and more adaptive than previous games. - Cleanest release on my end, I have run into very few major bugs and most of them are minor and not game breaking.  Plus no major CTD issues too, unlike 3 and NV which CTD randomly on me without warning even after mod based fixes.  Now for the negative points (2/10) - The odd bug that gets in the way but nothing too serious, except for one quest involving MacCready where he will not move. - Game UI in some places is clunky, especially in settlement building mode - A lot of troubles assigning settlers to places in settlement mode, again the clunky settlement UI - Horrible companion AI, can they please STOP blocking doorways and getting under foot! - Too addicting and taking up too much of my time!  KIDDING, this is not a real con this is a joke one, dang you Fallcrack!

I don't believe it is Bethesda being lazy as all the graphics kids seem to think. Yes they could be better but already an HD texture set is available just needs one of the highly skilled modders to be able to apply it to the game. However, the brightness of the Fog is annoying, but good old mods will fix that. There are already some wonderful presets which make the game look vibrant.  My FPS throughout has been between 50/60 even the larger battles. However the large battles generally hit your processor quite hard, so a good one is essential.  The gun play is so much better now, they nailed that and the melee is just as easy too.  The game is by no means perfect, but what game is? And before you say anything comparing this to TW3 (which everyone seems to do) is irrelevant, also that game is not perfect either.  I am sure all the haters gonna call me a fanboy or whatever, but in my eyes the game is good and really handy that it is pick up put down especially when you have a family. It's also nice to be able to use a female protagonist rather that the generic middle age man (yawn).  I am still trying to work out why people complain about the controls which are fine to me and yes I use a mouse and keyboard.  So overall the game is good, but needs a little work (like most), the AI can be rather dumb, followers included. Anyway disappointing score on here, but highly rated on steam… Expand "

Some of the changes aren't welcome ones, like the new perks system, but other changes feel like a solid step in the right direction -- the excellent and varied romanceable companions for example, or the sheer wealth of customisation options.  There are bad things about it, such as the limited options you get with which to reply to people, the OCCASIONAL bugs, and the fact that the world doesn't feel like a wasteland anymore due to the changes in the colour mood and the insane amount of enemies (which seems intended to appeal to FPS fans, but is boring for people like myself who is more of an RPG fan).  But these issues are FAR outweighed by the brilliance of the game, seen quite often during all types of gameplay. The world feels alive, the freedom feels at a new level, it's tough as nails, it's mostly quite pretty, and it's absolutely rammed full of excellent content and interesting characters, missions, and places. So much love and care has gone into designing every aspect of the world, and it all really shines through. The story is also very solid compared to Fallout 3 and Skyrim; I'm actually amazed that Bethesda were able to write it, and though by no means a literary masterpiece, the game narrative makes up for this fact with some great conversations you have with your companions.

This was one of the definitive power armor mods out there. -Weather effects, including radiation storms. -Custom variants of already included weapons. -Settlement building (Real-time Settler) -Layered armor And a ton more...  In regards to the perk tree... It does feel watered down, but it also feels like, just like with the dialog, choice matters more. Instead of arbitrary skill points that add simple multipliers for you to work towards, you're instead given half your usual SPECIAL amount from previous titles, and perk options that carry a lot more weight. Instead of stat raising for combat and picking more diplomatic or resourceful perks, you're left with only the option to either invest in combat that level, invest in resourcefulness, or raise your SPECIAL to work toward something. The system actually feels a lot more unforgiving than the previous iteration, so I can only see it as an improvement.  Same with dialog. While there may not be a defined karma system, karma is still technically there with the weight of conversation choices and your actions in general. In this game, it's less like karma is needed and more like it's completely redundant. This game just doesn't have a need for a system that was already sub-par to begin with.  Overall, this game is a beefed up Fallout 3 with a significantly more immersive experience, more intuitive controls, and vastly superior graphics (which actually look better than the newest Call of Duty, yet people say they're garbage for some reason). I recommend this title to everyone. It is perhaps the best Fallout title to date. It is by far the best Bethesda title to date as well.  If you want a stat management game - a genre that's been on it's way out since Mass Effect, go try Pillars of Eternity or Wasteland 2. Leave your shallow and dated statistical elements out of our immersive RPG experiences.  I thought I would edit this to include two things:  1) I play on survival difficulty.

Only the most fickle, graphicHere's the basic rundown:  Graphics - Above average for a Bethesda sandbox. Nothing stand out, but more than enough to get the job done for presenting the world of Fallout, which is filled with detail. Creature animations in particular are much improved over previous games, looking quite smooth compared to the jerky motions of Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Only the most fickle, graphic obsessive types would find much fault here.  Sound - Solid music that sets the atmosphere well enough, though Bethesda does lose a few points here due to reusing old songs on the radio from previous games. Voice acting ranges from decent to a bit below average, but still leagues above Skyrim's voices, and about on par with New Vegas. All ambient and environment/combat sounds are solid.  Story - Could have been worse, could have been better. There are some solid points held back by a somewhat limiting dialogue system and not as many chances to really make a variety of choices to roleplay various solutions to problems. There is some good environment storytelling with various holotapes and bits of text on terminals revealing interesting details about locations and people, while the main storyline's focus on the synths does have some good moments and lots of potential. Characters from NPCs to your numerous possible party members are all possessing of distinct personalities and while a few may be more stereotypical than others, each offers some amusing lines or has some engaging bit of backstory to learn. In some ways its more engaging than New Vegas' rather slim (pre-DLC) bare bones story, and is certainly better than the straightforward main quest in Fallout 3, but Fallout 4's story still falls a bit short here.  Gameplay - Butter smooth combat combined with a massive world filled to the brim with things to explore. The crafting system is pretty robust, with plenty of ways to mod up weapons and armor, and the need of countless items to do said mods provides good motivation to explore even if there weren't cool pick ups like the bobble-heads and magazines to also track down. Combat feels better paced than what was found in 3 or New Vegas, with VATS new crit meter adding a little extra control and punch to the fighting. Power armor is gained early, yet fells more important as it takes time to modify it to be stronger and a limited fuel source makes it feel more like a vehicle than a mere suit of armor.  The new method of folding most character customization into perks a bit wonky at first, but does well to streamline upgrading one's character. Skill points are gone, but are redundant at this point, as a perk can be used to upgrade yourself in any way you want from increasing your ability to pick locks or sneak, or do more damage with a particular type of gun, or gain access to better mods. Finally there is the settlement building. While completely optional it is possible to sink a LOT of hours building up the various settlements, connecting them with trade routes, and benefiting from the additional access to resources doing so provides. For those who like to tinker and build, this aspect of the game alone could provide a lot of entertainment value.  Final Conclusion - Fallout 4 does a lot right, far more than it does wrong. It provides a huge, interesting world to explore while engaging in fast paced, fun combat. If it had a more robust dialogue system and more options for ways to solve quests this would go from being a good game, to being a brilliant one. As it is the game is a worthy addition to the franchise.… Expand "

The customization of weapons and base building lets me love hoarding even more.  The bad: The game has some bugs but what i have experienced is minor. Switching weapons my gun will disappear and have to switch from 3rd to first and back again. Nothing game breaking though. The graphics are not the best. Yeah witcher is better etc but mods will take care of that. The game has the same feel to it just like skyrim where your player doesnt feel attached all the time. Like destiny everything feels sharp and responsive where this feels more floaty and sluggish.  This though is still an excellent game. Its not perfect but it does have a ton of time availble to be sunk into it. Have over 30 hours still havent beaten main questline; theres lots of other stuff to do. It has lost some of its rpg style being able to be good or bad, but i never really got why you would be bad anyway? Walking into areas and people hating or attacking you gets annoying. Swtor being bad obviosuly has a purpose but this game it never really made a difference to me. Also the perk tree is simplified and gives less room to exploit levels. Skyrim, NV, you could just walk into a wall for an hour and have max sneak. This way makes it more difficult and also lets you skip perks you dont want is your SPECIAL is high enough.  Lastly complaining that they give you the power armor and see a deathclaw to early? Why does that matter.

Dialogue is about as uninteresting as FO3, and the dialogue system is exceptionally irritating (it definitely isn't placating that it looks like the bad system was due to making it relatively usable on consoles), but the voice acting is substantially improved. I've only experienced one CTD in ~35 hours of play, which's kind of shocking for a Bethesda game, and I have only experienced minor glitching (mostly occasional missing textures, which is my own fault for trying to use Ultra textures on only 2GB gfx RAM). Optimization is also surprisingly solid -- I have an old A8-6600k I was worried would severely bottleneck the engine, but everything's going well, with utilization ~70-85% on 1080p Ultra (but shadows on low).  Didn't get into the crafting system -- begrudgingly collected a bunch of litter for the essentials, but that's always been the case for me in Bethesda games. Bethesda took a page out of the 2000-aughts (or someone there really liked Path of Exile) by giving a %chance of enemies being legendary. They're typically unimpressive, though, largely because there aren't mods yet to limit the absurd quantity of health items drowning the player at any given time -- the game really needs a reduction of ~95-98% on Normal, and still ~60-80% on Hard. Especially once you're reasonably pleased with what you're wearing and holding, and given your health rapidly restores to 100% with any one of your 500 stimpaks if you should ever run in trouble, there's no joy in finding legendary enemies unless the item they drop has a funny name, like the furious rolling pin. -But that only accounts for maybe 1% of legendary drops... and they all involve the rolling pin.  Speaking of procedural generation - Bethesda did some really cool stuff with it, most noticeably (well, for most, probably unnoticeably) with procedural generation of minor locations. I once fell to my death, and on my way to that death, I noticed a safe which I picked and looted. On reload, in this safe's place was a bartender named Mac with a little wooden stand... in the middle of the street, in the middle of nowhere. Cool!  Unfortunately, the major locations range from dull to outright frustrating in boredom caused. Level design's typically great and varied, but the stories involved feel like rehashings of everything in FO3+NV but with slightly altered details. I did indeed sigh out loud the moment I realized I'd 1) be at a military-owned airport, 2) be investigating supplies going missing, and 3) everyone thinks it's an inside job (and, yes, again, it is - and yes, there's another twist at the end - BUT THE TWIST'S TWISTED DIFFERENTLY THIS TIME). They feel well-made, but they're not fun. Having the game ask you to revisit these locations after you've already appreciated the nice little design touches by doing a World of Warcraft style of awful repeated fetch/kill/escort quests is THE WORST.  Music selection's initially irritating since it's all repeated content, but the game starts throwing in some new (and original!) stuff as you progress, which is a nice touch.  The game almost look like it was built from the ground up for modding. The number of dictionaries and other forms of pools in place are going to lead to a 10/10 game - no doubt - but for now, it's just too flawed and dull to blindly recommend, and I actually think the game would be substantially improved by CUTTING OUT a lot of the uninteresting content currently littering the game - but at the same time, I'll probably spend ~100 hours just in vanilla before I'm ready to put it on ice for a year to come back and see what modders do with it.… Expand "

Nothing revolutionary, of course, but quite fit in Bethesda's game style (story level for mentally retarded, dialogues level for complete idiots and ""wooden"" characters without spark of life in them). For those who like an ""open world"" in general, crafting and building and don't give a **** about story it seems to be a decent find. As for the others... For me the last Fallout was Fallout 2. The ""things"" which are now called by the name of «Fallout» (starting from the 3rd and including NV) are curious misunderstandings. From this point of view F4 is primitive SciFi Skyrim shooter in the ""open world"" with crafting and ""minecrafting"".

TLDR FO4 is a major disappointment for a me. I expected a lot more from a 2015 game, coming from a veteran in Open world RPG.  Graphics: 6/10 - very low resolution textures, occasional bugs, not @ 2015 level. Audio: 4/10 Really good at times (when entering areas for the very first time, but rehashing radio songs is no good). Lipsync is utterly unacceptable for a AAA game. Story: 3/10 - Absolutely lack of pacing and emotions in dialog and voice acting. The UI for the dialog system has been butchered into 3 words or less, and is always to same formula. Good, bad, Sarcastic, more information.  SPOILERS alert!

You find out its 200 years later when you get out of the vault, and you're just adjusted right into killing hundreds of human beings + monsters.

I expect it from a normal white 30ish male who's lived in a suburb and just woken up from cyro sleep, instead of a killing machine. I literally killed an entire building full of raiders within the first 20 minutes out the vault, and my guy shrugs it off like it's no biggie.  Gameplay: 6/10 Here is where is earns some points. The FPS system is more fun and engaging then previous FO3, but the Inventory management is the biggest ****ing cluster**** I've ever seen. One of the design constraints of a console port on PC, the UI looks good in principle, but **** when picking up a lot of items and trying to find the ones you need to sell. Still, it's a game engine they used from 7 years ago, a lot of mechanics are copy paste from FO3. Even if it's a sequel, it needs to be improved. Otherwise why don't I just keep playing FO3.  World building: 5/10. World feels dead, the Cities feels dead. A lot of stuff just doesn't make any sense. For example, the insane amount of ammo that you can loot in the game, versus actually having to scavenger like the desperate wanderer/survivor you are, you never have to buy ammo in this game. I know ""it's just a game"" but for a 2015 RPG, it's not good enough. I expected an experience, not just a FPS.… Expand "
Schlapatzjenc,"Nov 16, 2015",7," I feel like this game deserves an honest opinion from someone who actually spent some time on it.

To address some of the issues people have pointed out:  1# Comparing this game to Fallout 1 or 2 is utterly pointless. It works differently, as did New Vegas and 3. It's not your classical point'n'click adventure type RPG and you can't divert all your focus into how well the script is made. There are other important factors that REALLY take a ton of time to take care of. It's not the same type of the game, and as much as I love F2, I would like to stress that most people perceive the game as better because of nostalgia/lack of certain mechanical expectations. It could very well receive a similar amount of criticism on various aspects.  2# Combat is more dynamic, which is a good thing. No, it's not Call of Duty, unless you pay no attention to what type of enemy you're facing (different resistances) and don't use V.A.T.S. at all. New Vegas was exactly the same. The animations given to Ghouls, or Deathclaws actually make the game feel more immersive, aside from being fast-paced.  3# Difficulty system is done poorly, the enemies simply becoming bullet sponges at higher levels. Fortunately, there already are mods to address that.  4# Main quest indeed is boring and predictable. I felt literally no drive towards doing it and I still don't 80 hours in. That being said, certain sidequests (mostly tied with exploration) are really interesting. Naturally there are some ""fetches"" or ""exterminations"" that seem bland, but at the same time, all you have to do is dig deeper to find something really good. I feel like most people here didn't.  5# THE GAME IS PRETTY. I don't know if you are comparing it to Mirror's Edge 2, or Crysis 7, but there really isn't much room to complain. It's much prettier than all Fallouts before it and does live up to expectations. The only thing I found annoying was discrepancy between resolutions of textures on certain surfaces. But hey, that will either be patched or modded very very soon. Contrary to a popular belief, animations are actually made well enough, some surprisingly good (certain enemies), some disappointing (lip sync). They average out on just about what you'd expect from another Fallout, looking at F3 and NV. Models are flawless. Don't like the color palette? Download re-shading mod, like I did. 2 minutes and the engine gave me exactly what I wanted.  6# Performance isn't horrible. The game on my PC runs better with high settings than NV. Certainly could be improved, certain areas are prone to stutter for no apparent reason. Are the graphics justified? Arguably yes. Please consider the amount of assets placed in each location. And frankly, if you can't meet box-requirements, you have no right to be complaining about FPS issues. Some 'reviewers' here are.  7# Developers' choice of timing on introducing certain things (Power Armor, Minutemen) is horrid. It does not break the game, but makes you feel like you missed a few episodes of your show. Deserves reprimand.  8# UI is just as usable, as it was in previous titles. Frankly the only annoying part to me is how slow the scrolling is. Dialogue wheel... it's worse than box was. Not much worse, just worse. It doesn't make talking a pain, it doesn't make your milk go bad. It's an understandable choice considering chaotic writing of dialogues (otherwise it would be sometimes impossible to tell which answer is sarcastic and which outright negative) but that shouldn't be a case in the first place. Building mode is made well, though could use some things like TUTORIAL or being able to run and open doors while in it. If you're not an idiot, you'll get it in a couple of minutes. Still, could use polishing.  9# Bugs. A lot of bugs. From A.I., through sound, up to some quests. Personally haven't encountered anything game-breaking, but most are outright annoying. The game clearly did not receive enough testing before release, but I'm willing to forgive Bethesda, as they are known for releasing massive batches of bugfixes every so often.  To put it as simply, as I can...  Is the game a piece of fecal matter, deserving 1/10? No and you'd have to be high to give it that. Anything below 5 is a result of finger cramp and missing the right mark. I strongly believe 6-7 is fair at this point, before changes are made.  Will you have fun with this game? Yes, you will, unless you are a game-fascist. All it needs is a little bit of brains behind it and patience for devs to release patch. I was disappointed at first, I am having fun after giving it some time.  Do I work for Bethesda? I'd wish.  Should I pay [original retail price] for it? I'd wait until it drops to New Vegas initial level. You won't feel like you overpaid and the game should be much more polished by then.… Expand "

Especially NPC characters during conversations look off. Their animations are stiff, facial animations are non-existant and lip-sync is most of the time wrong too. - Voice acting: Most NPCs deliver their lines in a monotone, flat voice completely devoid of any emotion. - Bugs. Not the buggiest game I ever played, but it's still pretty bad. - Performance. While the game runs at 50-60 fps most of time, sometimes, for no apparent reason it drops to less then 20 for a bit. This doesn't happen often, but enough to be annoying. - Inventory management: Way to much time is spent sifting through your bag, making sure your not encumbered, looking for crafting components etc.  Overall it's a good game (I'm over 50 hrs in to it atm), however the various problems and bugs keeps from reaching it's true potential.

If you take Mass effect system as a comparison, that would be an ideal far beyond. It's true what people say: you really have to guess what you are going to say. I thought this is an exaggeration, but it's not.  I feel very mixed about writing. At some points, writing does seem silly at the level never experienced before in a Fallout game. Your protagonist feels like a child: naive and inconsistent. In case of this game, the main story is forced on and you have extremely little part making choices here. That's where voice acting and a strong (by default) character would come in (like Mass effect series), but here it results in a disastrous sense of controlling and watching a complete imbecile. I do not want to bring spoilers in, but voice acting and your character's comments usually seem absolutely ridiculous and out of place during major events and plot twists.  On the other hand, some characters are pretty good even compared to Fallout: New vegas. Their background is interesting, motivation is interesting as well, so it's a job well done in this case. Their texts (dialogues) are much better as well and are interesting to follow as well. Side quests are decent too and they keep you playing. Attention to detail is great and satisfying. Old magazines, notes, terminals - that's very well made and provides you with a perspective on a lore and the old events that took place.  NPCs usually have a few interesting things to tell as well. Random events are very rare, I have encountered just a few during my playthrough. Exploring buildings without quests was not rewarding, there is a slight chance you would encounter something interesting quest or story wise.  About RPG elements.  The new SPECIAL system could have been a good move if made properly, but it's not. With this, the game feels like a shooter. You can comfortably shoot your way through the game without investing points in combat related stats or perks. And it's a disastrous thing in a Fallout game. If you make a shooter, why do this and keep VATS, other related elements? At this point (gameplay wise) it's a poor shooter AND a bad RPG. Betheseda should decide where to take this, and a proper way would be to improve on the old system, making it more logical, deep and accessible.  This game lacks atmosphere and deepness of the old games, but everything stitched together, it still manages to make you want to play this. But it's a dangerous way, making gamers feed on nostalgia and mere references. This time I can enjoy that game, but if the next Fallout comes out like this, I will probably pass and look elsewhere.… Expand "

First off, is Fallout 4 a flawed game? Definitely, this is Bethesda we're talking about, some bugs are lingering, though speaking only from my own experience, my playthrough has thus far been more stable than my first run at most other Bethesda games in recent memory, so make of that what you will. The graphical fidelity is also below what many would prefer or demand, but this isn't really an issue for me, they make damn good use of what they have, the aesthetic design makes up for any losses in raw power, though your mileage may well vary.  Fallout 4 is not a zero-star game, this page and the trolling scores inspired me to make a metacritic account, because yes, some things have been streamlined, weapons no longer degrade (something for which I am actually grateful) and stats/skills/perks have been revamped substantially (which I have more mixed feelings on) but ultimately I feel that what has been lost is more than made up for with new things.  For example, the town-building system may be fairly rough, but there's still enough nuance, interesting systems and purpose to it for me to be engaged, it is a weirdly Zen feeling to clear away tree stumps and house debris so that I can make new crops and buildings, and the ability to set up shops in these places means you have greater options for unloading your surplus gear, you really do feel like a community leader after a while, even if most settlers are too gormless to figure out how to help themselves.  Another new system that I very much enjoy is the weapons and armour customization, almost all modifications alter the appearance of the weapon in some way, and many dramatically affect performance rather than just staple on a few extra points of damage or range, there are the expected scopes and stocks for sighting and stability, but there's also adding a lens to your laser pistol to turn it into a sawn-off laser shotgun, or wrapping your Minigun's barrels in barbed wire and blades.  But at the end of the day, it's the little things that make me love Fallout 4, the way Feral Ghouls move disturbingly, charging and tumbling, playing dead, instead of just screaming a bit and swiping at you, the way that they've made Power Armour a lot more than just top-tier standard armour, the way that pipe weapons exist, these cobbled-together improvised weapons that raiders prefer, because they don't always have access to pre-war assault rifles.  People may be sad that Fallout is different to what they've enjoyed previously... but that doesn't make it a bad game, just a different one.… Expand "

It's entirely subjective what one person enjoys over the other, but I, as a fan of the series since the first game, keep finding myself unable to stop playing it. I do hear that some people have had bad experiences with the game, not getting it to run, frames dropped and stuff like that, but I have not experienced anything of the kind, so it seems I've been lucky, I guess.  I've put a total of 120 hours into the game. (I received my copy about a week ago, Friday the 6th, due to some shipping error)  This is the true wasteland experience. The graphics are beyond description. While it does not have the fidelity of other modern titles, it manages to still be aesthetically pleasing in a way that really reminds me of the old, isometric sprites. The guns feel and handle like guns do in a modern shooter. Normally this wouldn't be impressive, but combined with an extensive crafting system, a deep and interesting armor system, settlement building, side quests more memorable than any of the ones in New Vegas (Looking at you, Silver Shroud, I'll never forget you), interesting morally gray factions and voice-work way beyond anything else we've seen from Bethesda, it's hard to not enjoy this game.  Every level you progress makes you feel like you have a big decision ahead of you, because the perk you pick can entirely change your play-style for the next level. They're unique and dynamic in fantastic way, sans a few examples, but with 70 perks, at least some must be boring, right? Well, the one that makes you find more ammo, for example, is really boring. Useful? Sure. But definitely boring.  The removal of karma and reputation and inclusion of companions being the ones judging you was a stroke of genius. Karma did not affect anything in the previous games either way, it just gave you some insight on whether or not what you did was morally acceptable or not. Reputation did the same thing, but to a smaller scale and with actual impact. Now, this time they've chosen the best option. The real option. The option that says ""Oh, you want to steal? Steal, as long as you can get away with it"" Of course, your friend might tell you they dislike what you just did, but who cares about what they think? You probably need these resources more than the people you steal it from anyway! This is a perfect example of how morals cease to exist when the world has no government.  The game in this package is impossible to put down. It consumes you, drags you into the world and doesn't let you go. For this reason, as a video game, Fallout 4 is a nearly perfect 10/10. I am reminded of the first time I picked up Dark Souls. It was so new to me, the entire way it dealt with combat and the world building. Now don't get me wrong, there's only a few examples of this game being subtle about it's lore, but when it happens it's usually heartbreaking and depressing, because it does indeed tell the story of a nation put to ruin, and the lives taken from this.  Most of the negative reviews I find simply complain that it's not like New Vegas, and I am thankful. New Vegas was outdated, and could never have come out today, even if the graphics were improved. It's on my list of favorite games of all time, but that game has had years of modding to allow it to become something better than it initially was. At launch, New Vegas was a mess, but time helped it and made it a wonderful game. Fallout 4 however, has at least to me, been a wonderful game, and I suspect time will only make it better.… Expand "

Just because you could theoretically max out special and access all the perks doesn't mean you have to.  As a personal opinion, having also loved 3 and new Vegas, I really love playing this. I think what's been culled and unecessarily streamlined is outweighed by the improved gun play, the modding system, the base building and the wealth of tightly designed side questing. Specifically the dungeons that aren't even scripted quests. One of my favourite examples was clearing out super mutants from an office building. Whilst doing this the computer logs, audio recordings and dungeon design told an entertaining story of a dispute between the partners of the company. It seems to me that there's a story everywhere and quite often the story told outside the quests is more entertaining than those in the quests.

Akrabra,"Nov 13, 2015",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          A Masterpiece in its own right. Fallout 4 might be a little rough around the edges, but when the world opens up and welcomes you into it, then there is no turning back.  Detailed world - Simply put the details in this game will put many developers to shame. Every object in the world is placed with care and though, every object has functions and animations to perform these functions.  Game-play - A huge step up from FO3 and New Vegas. Gun play is vastly improved to give the game a good weapon handling feeling. Though easier to hit enemies without proper stats, it is still tied in nicely with weapon crafting, armor crafting and SPECIAL/Perks. Keeping it grounded as an RPG with the stats doing its magic in the background. Other crafting also includes a cooking system, and a chem system.  Story - The story is quite solid and actually has some twists and turns you won't see coming. The characters you meet in the world are interesting and unique. Dialogue is better than ever and every dialogue choice made might move the conversation forward in unexpected ways, so weigh your options carefully. Factions are present in this game and they are all well presented within the setting. Having their own motivations and ideology. Will you save the Commonwealth from itself? Will you turn it into a state for human hope, or take it down a dark path? The choice is yours and it works well.  Companions - Interesting individuals might join you on your journey, and they are a fancy bunch of misfits in true Fallout style. Each individual joining you have their own motivations, backstory and preferences. Dialogue is tied to a like/dislike system which works very well. Unlike other game with companions you can't have everyone liking you because of the choices you make in the game. Their combat AI is abit rough, and they can grate your nerves, but the positives outweigh the negatives on this one.  Atmosphere - The new colour palette, lighting options, water graphics and weather system all lends the game a much needed lift in the atmosphere depatrment. The world is beautiful, and scary. The music does it part to keep you hooked, both inside and outside of combat. Every small detail adds to this atmosphere and keeps the world fresh throughout the game.  Exploration - The exploration is top notch in every aspect. Assisted by great gameplay, atmosphere, and the attention to detail no two locations are the same and every location has a story to tell. It might lead to a new quest from a note, holotape, computer or just an npc that needs your help. Every time you go around a corner something new is happening, and it keeps you hooked for hours on end.  Graphics - As atmosphere is part of this, the graphics are in its way great. Though the engine is now very old, and it is sadly a console port. Textures range from amazing to very poor. Character models is a huge improvement compared to Skyrim, but lacking compared to other RPG's out this year, same goes for animations.  UI - The UI quite bad, or it is easy enough to use, but it was built for console. This has however been a problem with Bethesda since Morrowind, and TW3/DA:I also had these problems. I don't see this changing for any huge RPG in the future, seeing as consoles are the main market.  All in all to me this game is not perfect. It has its rough edges and some things that i wish were different. To me though those things just evaporates when i start exploring and taking part in this amazing world Bethesda has built. This is the masterpiece i was waiting for, and got. 10 does not mean perfect, it just means i enjoy it that much.… Expand "

System Requirements: Before writing this review I saw some people complaining that requirements too high ... . . . Really?! I found only one ""high"" requirement: 30 Gb on hard drive. Done! I'm assuming that no one trying to run game on old Pentium with 32 Mb of GPU memory... And there is a nice Metacritic review, telling us that guy has  rig for 20 000 Euro and he has 10 Fps in game ... Nice joke. This review has to be deleted.  Gameplay: I like Fallout 3.

Before you take their word for it, have a look for these phrases ""not what it's supposed to be like"" ""Not what I was expecting"" ""not what I want from an RPG"" or ""The worst game of all time"". Does this sound like fair and balanced criticism to you? Or the sheep-like whining of cynical, overly entitled gamers who talk of old games in hushed tones, with a tear in their eye and anything that came out this year in a manner usually reserved for infectious diseases?  But never fear - this game is actually fantastic.  Lots of bugs, but mostly just funny little quirks that'll get ironed out. For the $60 price tag, you get at a minimum 100hrs of gameplay, even if you don't really deviate from the main story. All of it enjoyable and varied. One minute you'll be a caped-crusader tackling organised crime, the next a bank robber pulling off a daring heist. You can explore countless buildings to discover the fate of their previous inhabitants, or get to know their newest residents. Just don't be surprised if they don't all like you. I'm not exaggerating either. In the largest settlement, there isn't a single building which isn't populated.  Some features from previous games are gone though. Imagine, a game company attempting to try new things and innovate. The sheer audacity. You may have noticed the same 'missing' features come up time and again in negative reviews, so lets run down the most popular:  Karma: In Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, you were only rewarded if you did everything wrong (stealing, lying, intimidating) or everything right (helping, healing, giving). You were Pol Pot Or Gandhi. Martin Luther King or Adolf Hitler. So what's your motivation now? Your travelling buddies. They all have different morals and will reward you with a helpful perk if they like the cut of your jib sufficiently. I can only assume those criticizing this are basement dwellers to whom friends are an alien concept.  Repairing stuff: The most IRRITATING feature added in New Vegas by independent developer obsidian, thankfully not carried over to this game by Bethesda. For the sake of 'realism', this meant every gun and piece of armor got steadily worse until it broke or you repaired it. So tough luck if you're stuck in a dangerous area without your chosen weapon, you'll just have to reload an old save. How very immersive.  NPCs can't die in this game: They can take enough damage that they will no longer fight for you until the battle is over though. Bethesda have given a good reason for this. In play tests, they noticed people getting frustrated with their companions constantly dying. They kept reloading old saves until they could get through tricky bits, eventually opting to just travel alone. This compromise makes them more useful, less irritating and more fun to be around. But 9 times out of 10, if you're getting your ass handed to you, so are they, so don't expect them to win the fight for you single-handed either.  Character backstories/ lack of RPG elements: This is one criticism I can't get my head around at all. Apparently all RPGs up until this point allowed you to play as any conceivable character. Just think about this for a second. Can you think of any RPG where you weren't at least partly expected to accept a certain amount of backstory? There you go. But you can decide if you want to be a super genius, or a simpleton. A charismatic Lothario, or a socially inept recluse. Do you outsmart your enemies or outgun them? Charge in head first, or sneak around through the back entrance, picking a lock or hacking a computer terminal?  Lack of conversation options: The onyl difference between this and New Vegas is you have four distinct options, rather than five ways to say the same thing. No, you can no longer see exactly what you are going to say before you say it. This is actually quite fun. Choose to intimidate, be sarcastic or persuade and you are treated to a unique bit of dialogue for every option (something which was entirely missing from previous games in the franchise).  Story/voice acting: Possibly the strongest aspect of the game. Better than any Bethesda game to date by a mile. I have no idea where the hate is coming from on this front. You won't be spoon fed anything though. You have to hunt the best stories out, which only makes them more rewarding. You tend to find out more about stories as you venture further into locations, often only discovering the full story at the very end. Avoiding spoilers as much as possible: find a lake in the southwest of the map. Find a cabin. Access the terminal. One of the saddest tales in gaming will greet you.  By far my favourite thing though is the visual stories. There are just so many, some hilarious, some sad and some disturbing. All entertaining.… Expand "

The Mod community will absolutely add a phenomenal amount of fantastic content to this game, which is what made Fallout 3, Skyrim, and Fallout NV so incredibly fun and long-lived despite the vanilla games being rather ""eh"".  It really is just Bethesda planting a seed and the community taking off and helping it  grow.  I'll address the potential of mods at the end, but until then it's just the base game as it is with mods I'm using now mentioned.  Dialogue: It's had me in stitches for 80 hours.  When you click to interrupt someone on an important part (i.e. them talking about  their dead kid or something) and you just go ""Uh-huh"" or ""Hmmm"".  Funny as hell. Story: Didn't even beat Skyrim, and don't care to ever beat Fallout 4.  Apparently it's crap, though, but I'm only gonna give it half as much weight as usual since I don't care for it to begin with.  Gunplay: VAST improvement over Fallout 3  Customization: I'm a huge fan.  Lots of options, lots of fun.  Well done, in my opinion.  Power Armor:  I wish there was more mysticism to it, really.  I wished that deathclaw in the very beginning smashed the **** out of my armor and I didn't get another set for 30+ hours.  that would have been better.  Difficulty:  Total mess.  AI is smarter, but for Bethesda, ""Hard mode"" is literally doubling their damage and halving yours.  Nice job, idiots.  I'm trying various damage mods, and found 2.5x for me dealing and 3x for enemies dealing evens things out a little more.  Can be done to 3x and 4x I guess.  Might try that later.  Those multipliers with the damage mod do a decent job at that, though.  As it stands now, buckshot to the face will kill even a Super Mutant my level as it should (though some wildlife has way too much health), my power armor can take a good beating before I go down but I still need to stick to cover usually, and even a raider my level wearing just some crap metal will get demolished from a couple laser blasts to the chest or one to the face, usually.  Again, as it should be.  When I'm out of my power armor I still take a considerable amount of damage, though, but then again I haven't fought much outside of raiders out of my power armor.  I'd like to be about as fragile as all of the other enemies with ARMOR and what type of enemy it is determining how much it takes to kill, and not level.  I'm getting close to that with these damage modifiers alone, for now, and I'd recommend them.  I can also smoke a Deathclaw with a few blasts from a fully modded combat shotgun.  One to the face should kill pretty much anything, but I wish it would take more to kill them as they're not frightening anymore with the mods I have.  They can kill me pretty quick, but again the damage mods only multiply what damage is done, and I can't really change the balance between enemy types yet until GECK comes out.  Still, look into those mods.  Base Building:  I see many, many hours of my life being lost to this.  AI:  In combat they're solid.  A lot smarter than before.  Watching the robots, bugs, and deathclaws juke my shots is nice.  Except for the deathclaws.  It's just horrifying in those cases.  Companion AI pathing makes me want to scream.  It is awful, atrocious, and whoever wrote it deserves to have their hands cut off so they can never do something like that again.  End of story on that.  Graphics:  Throw on some ENBs and it'll look presentable.  Again, these Bethesda games never looked good vanilla, anyway.  Map size:  Not sure if I'm greedy after TW3, but it feels small despite being of relatively respectable size.  Final:  The unspeakable amount of fun I've had playing the game minus the quite considerable flaws grants it an 8 in my book.  It's good.  Not what we hoped for, probably, but it's good.  It'll do.  Let's hope Bethesda can do better next time, though, because there's a fine line  between me loving and despising this game.  Luckily it's holding.  Mods:  This is where the magic happens.  Already there are some fantastic mods out that greatly improve the game.  From more balanced fusion core draining, to these damage mods I mentioned, to sound and texture/graphic and enb mods...  There's a crapton within two weeks.  Once the GECK comes out it'll be unreal.  The weapon mod system, base building, and settlement system are PRIME for mods.  One of the first will be to build settlements ANYWHERE, I can guarantee you that.  Hopefully they can expand the map as well.  Bethesda made a decent framework that's great fun as is, and for that they get a good rating, but certainly not GOTY with The Witcher 3 reigning supreme in that regard.  Now the community will be what makes this game a truly fantastic 10/10.  They deserve ALL of the credit for that.  Can't wait to see what lies in store for Fallout 4.… Expand "

And similarly while I understand people want to raise the metascore it is also no way a 10/10 and both are misleading and do no justice in helping people make a decision to buy this game.    Its worth mentioning at this point I am not a die hard fallout fanboy although i have played both 3 and new vegas. I Hope this will help give any reader the impression i can deliver a fair review.    Ill start with the bad and get it out the way!    As others have mentioned the graphics are quite poor and more importantly the performance and frame drops should be better considering they are not up to standard. While i agree graphics are not everything we are indeed consumers and in no other industry would you pay top money for an out of date product ( think mobile phones etc )    Bugs- during my 16 hours I have had no game breaking bugs or hard crashes . However they are present and can at times break immersion or be frustrating.    Dialogue wheel - A great device in bioware titles where games usually give you a defined character . But Bethesda titles are usually more about creating your own character with motives and so it just doesn't fit in well here. The topics are extremely vague so it is also hard to know what your character is going to say.  The mediocre    Story telling and characters. - While i have not completed the main story I have played enough to not feel emotionally attached to the centre plot. The character voice acting to go with it is also neither bad or good and just rather does it's job then actually impress.    The good.    Combat- Improved over previous titles without losing that fallout touch. VATS is even better now that it does not freeze time. Depending on the situation this can be a blessing like as an enemy dives out of cover. It can also be a curse when your forced to make decisions quick. In all it adds more depth to the combat system.    Perks- a marmite subject atm. Some believed the new system has been dumbed down. I Disagree which I will cover in the next point. I personally felt there was a alot of trash perks in the older games. The new perk system gives you a good amount of freedom to make your favourite arch types but enough restriction to make you invest points carefully.    Weapon and armour modding- Not only do both weapon and armour mods have cosmetic changes, they drastically change how your character plays. Thus still having strong rpg elements. How you build your armour and guns should reflect your play style and if they dont. You will notice your combat abilities suffer. The entire crafting system across the game is fantastic and there is alot of variety for making grenades , food, and the meds etc.    shelters- The new craftable towns amd shelters does not really serve a purpose at the moment but that doesnt stop them being fun to use and building on an all ready good sandbox game.    Environment- The strongest thing about this game. Tonnes of areas to explore, you will want to spend a lot of time just wandering  the wasteland! New dynamic weather  affects are cool like the radiation storms!  If you want to see what a 1 out of 10 game is. Watch angry joes review of ride to hell. Use this to learn what a really bad game looks like.… Expand "

When I initially started the game, I was a bit disappointed in the toning down of some of the rpg elements like the skill system and dialogue options.  After a bit of time playing however (level 22 atm), I have to say I'm really enjoying the game it is.  There are tons of things to do and while the map may seem small at first, it's really misleading because there are many underground areas, areas inside buildings, and even an airship.  There's been a big change to power armor, which makes it a powerful limited resource.  I do wish there were more trash mobs and random happenings going on in the world as you travel.  The gameplay is much more fluid than past games.  My PC specs are (I7 | 3.2ghz |12 gigs of ram | geforce gtx 750ti card).  Not a super powerhouse machine, but I've have had no crashes or any type of graphical issues so far.

It is one of my favourite series. I didn't particularly like Fallout 3 AKA Oblivion with guns, but i enjoyed it for what it was. New Vegas was a vast improvement, technical issues aside. Still, Bethesda seems to lack basic understanding of what made the Fallout series great, and they seem to want to turn it into a Farcry-wannabe instead of a proper RPG.  Fallout 4 is not a bad game, but it is not a great game either. It is first and foremost a Farcry4 type shooter, with more dialogue and minecraft elements. That's about it.  My problem with Fallout 4 is that it feels empty, tedious, boring, lifeless. It has no soul, it is just a ""product"", not a work of art. Sure, shooting mechanics were improved, looting is faster etc, but those are only minor improvements and don't make up for the loss of unique settlements/npcs/questlines. Most of the quests are randomized, most NPCs are just randomized, game is a repetitive grind. It is perhaps the only Fallout series game that i struggled finding the motivation to keep playing, i had to actually convince myself to play it, to try and have fun with it.  There are many things that grind the game's pace to a halt. The loot system is bad overall. Junk are more important than proper equipment now, since your craftable mods are better than whatever you find or buy. You also need tons of junk to improve your settlements (the map has few prebuild settlements, you have to create most of them yourself). So wherever you go, you just have to loot everything, and there is only so much space in your inventory... Having to make multiple trips back and forth to base is not uncommon, to transfer all the loot. This gets boring fast. Sure, you may argue that you can choose not to get all the junk, but that means that by the time you need to craft a mod, repair armor, or just improve your settlement, you won't have everything at hand.  The story was ok-ish, for a Bethesda game. You don't play Bethesda games for the story after all, but for the sandbox. But it just doesn't offer you much of an incentive to keep grinding. You never feel like you need to get to the end to find out about the lore, you just don't care, it is something that just exists.  All in all, it is a by the book Bethesda product. It has no ambition, and no character. You can have fun with it, assuming you are not bored to death with Bethesda's recipe already. You aren't missing anything if you never touch it, no important lore or really good gameplay. You can skip it. Witcher 3, this is not.… Expand "
GolovA,"Nov 16, 2015",6,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Well, first of all, people, i don't get u - y u giving 0, 1, & 2's or on the other spectrum - 9 & 10's? I mean 0-3 score is basically an abomination to avoid, and 9-10 is perfection itself. And FO4 is neither. The funny thing is that 1's balance the 9's at the end and the mean average is not really affected. But come on - giving a game a 1 just because ""the graphics sucks, man!"" is not helping anybody, plus the technology is not moving at a lightning fast speed. It is still gradual, although i agree the graphics in FO4 are behind - mind you, most likely because the game was designed for an outdated console. Giving it a 9 is also obnoxious - the fact is, it is far from being a masterpiece.  Having said that, i will not dwell in depth on the topic. What i'd like to do is to share a few observations in defense of my rating. I am currently playing Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 4 and can compare the two. Now i have to admit, i am playing FONV with mods such as Nevada Project, EVE, Weapons Mods Extended, and Nevada Skies. However, even though they greatly improve the atmosphere of the game, they don't have any effect on some of my criticism of FO4. Also, all of the mods are almost as old as New Vegas.  First thing's first - bugs. Yes, there are many many bugs in the current release. Are they destructing? You bet your sweet bb gun they are! Annoying? Bull's eye too. But the game is still entertaining enough to get that Save reloaded and start over. Just pray your last Save isn't an hour old! :D RELOAD!  Lip sync. Lip syncing in FO4 is quite atrocious. By comparison - NV is like a lip syncing marvel. What does it tell me about developers of FO4 and their mentality towards gamers? /:) yep. RELOAD.  Dialogue. Man, this latest trend to streamline everything that doesn't need to be streamlined is bugging the **** out of me. All dialogue is watered down to 4 choices most of which are very obscure since all of them are limited to like 3 words! Are you crazy!? Sentences such as ""Give Money"" make no sense, and plenty a time i had to find out that behind a remark was hidden a line of dialogue i did not wish to follow. Give money to you? Are we talking about giving money? Will you be giving money to me? Is there a catch? By comparison FO3 and NV dialogue trees are extremely prolific. RELOAD!  Combat. I don't know, man. I don't know. I guess combat is a little better and more dynamic? I don't know. Just slightly. I don't see it anything to be raving about. It's ok. Not gonna give the game a 10 because i can throw a grenade (finally!) with a key.  Character development and skill tree. Oh boy. It's new. But i can't bring myself to like it. Basically, in place of skills (all skills) you now have perks. Again, streamlining something that needs not be. In FO3 perks were unique and depended on your characteristics, and you could put points in any skill you wanted. So if u were an Intelligence 1 Village Idiot, you could still up your science or repair or whatnot, but would never get perks that depended on intelligence. In FO4 you only get perks, so, using the example above, you cannot become a master hacker with Intelligence 1. It's kind of more realistic, yet also so limited and even degraded. Can't there be an Imbecile Savant (u know wat i'ma talkin' bout!) who can hack computers at a whim but like unable to get dates?! :D come oooon!!! RELOAD!  Side quests.  Ok, ok - my friend who finished the game testifies that i am about one-third in.  At this point i can say a few things about the main story line and side quests.  Some side quests are pretty involving and fun, while others (such as ""Build me a Village"") are plain boredom.  Sure, it is fun to recycle old cars and broken fences in order to built some houses for the nomad Minute Men - but that's precisely where the danger lies - while being fun IT IS NOT FALLOUT!  Damn it, what's next - ""Fallout Settlers"", ""Apocalyptic Minecraft"", ""LEGO Fallout""?!  Dude!  My husband was just shot, and i am searching for my kidnapped baby!  You want me to build you a shack, you lazy ****  I'ma shoot you in your foot for dat! Yes, i do like building - but, man, when i start playing FO i am as far from wanting to build as North Pole is from Jamaica.  Call me Paradigm Dave - but i don't like my white wine in the same glass with the red.  RELOAD!  Main Story - it's pretty decent, and has its own twists and turns.  Sure, it's not elaborate, but come on - the main story is ok.  And if the old dialogue system remained it would actually be pretty damn good, i reckon, if only too linear.  But you know what, i am playing NV right now, and the main story line is too - kind of linear.  Compare to Fallout 1 & 2, where, for example, you could play with INTELLIGENCE 1 and play a different story almost.  Oi! :) can i recommend Fallout 4? No. Not at this stage. However, after the bugs are fixed, and Mods come out from the loving community - this will be a nice solid game. But don't expect anything specia… Expand "

The game sets out by introducing the player to a time before the war, where tensions between america and russia is at an all-time high, as you'll immediately hear it on the news. You're allowed to play either a male or a female character, (a tradition of the Fallout franchise), the husband or the wife. Shortly after, you're introduced to your infant son, in hopes that you'll bond with him. You won't. After a few minutes of exploration the alarms are set off, public service announcements are sent out on the radios and you make your way to a vault, shelter for humans to outlive the radiation of the nuclear bombs and the wasteland, for a while.  This solidifies the suspicions that the writers of Bethesda fundamentally do not understand the concepts and themes the previous installments explored. It's meant to be a morbid but comedic insight into the reestablishment of society, where various ideas on how it's meant to be done are tackled. Yet Fallout 4 chooses an on-the-nose approach without much conceptual exploration. You escape your icy prison back to the surface 200 or so years later. Only to discover that not much has happened for two centuries and people are still stuck culturally in the time you left behind. Odd, given that we as a species develop and establish fast. Do you remember what happened that long ago? Chances are you don't. At the very least, Boston is a joy to explore and the attention to detail is what sets it apart from other games, and unlike previous titles in the franchise, it features a lot of vertical exploration.  Boasted as new features to the franchise, settlements and customization of armor and weapons, albeit only to consoles. PC players has had these features /since/ Fallout 3, thanks to the modding community. Albeit, Bethesdas implementation is much more elaborate and /workable/. A common thing you'll be seeing throughout the game for all new additions to the game have been previously available as a mod.  A staple of the Fallout games /skills/ has been removed, in favor of solely focusing on perks and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats. A total of 70 perks are in the game, each of them can be expanded upon by sinking more points into. Yet, one will find that the perks are by-the-numbers and that the developers lacked imagination when it came to shaping your character, as gameplay features are entirely taken out with some, and other simply give boring damage increase or reductions.  Now, let's talk about dissonance between player and character. For there is a -lot- of it this time around, due to two new implementations. A voice for the character, and the popular but hated dialogue wheel. The VO is often overacted, lacks emotion and subtlety, and the stale facial animations rarely expresses the topic at hand. The wheel, clearly /taken/ from the Mass Effect franchise and solidified by the works of Telltale, reduces the broad set of options one would have in previous Fallouts, and dialogue /used/ to be a big part of the franchise, now taken a backseat in favor of the more guts galore combat. Rarely are the choices given to the player representative of what the character will say or do.  At the very least, shooting bullets, scrap and lasers, chucking grenades, planting mines and firing of mini-nukes has never been this satisfying in a Bethesda game. The developers obviously drew inspirations from Destiny - last years noteworthy multiplayer shooter, a highly criticized product. You'll be get to obliterate humanoids, beasts, mutants, robots and all manners of foes. Most notable addition the the array of target practices, are legendary foes. They're tougher, and deal more damage - but they always guarantee you a unique drop. You'll waste a lot of resources taking them down, shooting them in head or heels /over and over/ while going through your stimpaks (healthpacks) quickly, unless you're exploiting the ridiculously dumb AI.  In a year in which The WItcher 3, developed by a much smaller studio than Bethesda and for an even lower budget, comes out with highly praised graphical fidelity, it's inexcusable for a triple A game developer to come out with such supbar looks. Fallout 4, as quoted by Miller himself, looks like how you /remember/ Fallout 3, behind a veil of rose-tinted goggles, even so, it is a massive improvement over previous games, just not up to modern standards. It's subjective, however, and I found myself enjoying the aesthetic, which seemed to be a mix of retro Fallout and recent Bioware products.  Something that must be noted, and to be expected by a Bethesda game, is the state in which it was released. It's riddled with bugs, broken quests and performance problems.

Tilde_Gunderson,"Nov 15, 2015",7,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          Short Review: If you liked Skyrim, you'll probably like Fallout 4.  This game is not a perfect 10/10, but it's not a 0/10. It's a 7/10 game.  CONS: The game has issues. The story is not exceptionally interesting. Saving your son seems like a worthwhile goal, but once you find him, things don't really progress that much. You're just doing some kind of checklist after that.  (If you want to avoid spoilers, don't read the next paragraph) I joined the Institute, and the final mission felt somewhat empty. I was hoping to board the Brotherhood of Steel airship and kill the command from the inside. Instead, I just hacked Liberty Prime and it did the job for me (which didn't work until I used console commands). When my son died, I felt like there should've been more to do in the Institute.  The conversation wheel is vague, but I think everyone knows this. Why didn't they just use the Skyrim conversation choices? I know voice acting in the game is an impressive addition and adding more choices would mean more work for them, but even if they just stuck with four options, allowing you to see what you're about to say would be nice. I found myself constantly autosaving during conversations.  Graphically, the game could use some work. The frame rate's garbage, despite looking like Skyrim.  Locations aren't are interesting as New Vegas' locations. There isn't much of a variety of location types beyond coastal location, urban location, or outside the city locations (I'm sorry if that's vague). Even Diamond City, the biggest settlement in the game, is really underwhelming and not much happens in it. I just wish I could kill the people in the upper bowl stealthily without the security getting on my ass about it. If you thought Nazeem from Skyrim was bad... well, don't venture into the upper bowl of Diamond City.  I feel bad for anyone playing the console version because too many times did I have to fix a problem using console commands. I can't list all of the glitches I faced, but when I had to use a console command to complete the most important mission in the game, something's up.  PROS: However, there are some good aspects of it. The combat has been decently improved over Fallout 3. Fighting without VATS feels doable, and using sniper rifles is even more effective than before. Weapon customization and armour upgrades makes collecting scrap a worthwhile endeavour.  And most of all? NO WEAPON DEGRADATION!  I don't think one person enjoyed weapon degradation... and if you did, I... I don't know what to say to that. Congratulations, I guess? I think when most people see their favourite weapon starting to wear away and you have to continuously repair it to keep it in perfect condition, it doesn't make them feel good.  Companions are now more of a thing and the game rewards you for having them with companion-based perks (that stay even if you kill them! Hurray!). They don't hinder stealth anymore, and are generally well characterized.  NEITHER HERE OR THERE: There are some things that bother me, but they aren't exactly pros or cons.  In terms of equipment, I wasn't impressed with the power armour. I didn't like it when it changed my HUD, making it a little busier and changing my HUD colour. But I don't call this a bad thing since I primarily used sniper rifles and long-ranged weapons to fight, so my opinion on this matter is relatively moot.  Still on the topic of equipment: I never changed my equipment from the first few items I got in the beginning because the game stopped giving me SPECIAL-boosting equipment after level 15. But this could just be my own experience with the game.  Graphically, I actually liked the visuals. I don't think AAA games need to look photo-realistic. I just wish the game performed well and never really dipped in frame rates. Not entirely a problem, since this may be fixed later and it didn't hamper my gameplay too heavily.  Overall, this is a fun game that's well worth your time and $80 (depending on where you buy it).… Expand "

Visually, the game is decent looking. It won't compare to The Witcher 3: WIld Hunt, or Mad Max but the open world is atmospheric and gives the aura of dread, sadness, and dark colors that the Fallout games are known for. Textures are muddy and characters look like plastic dolls but that doesn't stop the game from being entertaining. As this is a review of the PC copy it will be a key note that modders will eventually patch in graphical tweaks and enhancements as every other Bethesda game has had before it.  The gameplay is the same fun mix of FPS/RPG elements that Fallout fans will love, but if you are expecting smooth transitions between firefights as seen in Call of Duty, Battlefield or Destiny you will be disappointed. The gunplay is solid but there are a few kinks here and there that make it slightly annoying but the V.A.T.S. mechanic helps to alleviate these issues and in my opinion adds to the gameplay when trying to find that sweet critical hit spot on a raider's head or sever a limb off of a suicidal super mutant running towards you with an armed fat man shell.  Speaking of V.A.T.S., this time around you don't have the benefit of the time stopping effect as seen with Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Time slows, giving the player a sense of urgency when aiming for specific body parts or figuring out if they want to queue their critical strike, which is also a new feature. Filling the critical meter allows the player to make a guaranteed critical hit this time around.  The dialogue is your usual rehashed cast of voice actors that every Bethesda game has and will win no awards here. They did do a good job of adding Bostonian accents this time around to make the game feel more authentic but expect to hear the same voices between chats. The main character has also received a voice this time around so it may or may not be harder for some players to imprint themselves onto their characters. I have had no issues doing so but I could understand why some people are annoyed with the idea that they can't give their own voice to the main character this time around.  The crafting system is a double edged sword. What could have been the perfect addition to the franchise has instead been marred with many difficulties. There is no standard tutorial and many players will find this frustrating as they flounder around with the different parts they can craft and place in their settlements. Want to know how to give power to a certain building? ""Figure it out!"" The game may as well be yelling at you with a smug look on its face.  Once you sort out all of the issues with the system it becomes a blast to place structures, power generators, lights, and even beds for your settlers. One major issue I noticed is that if you want to place anything you will have to manually walk to wherever it is you want to do so. There is no fast style of movement to speed this up and it can become a chore and hopefully that will be a feature the developers can add in later. Bethesda has made it clear that they plan on adding features as well as planned DLC for the game and that they will listen to the community to see what we want as far as quality of life changes are concerned.  The game is amazingly fun and is a very rewarding experience for any who choose to play it. It's not without its fair share of bugs, gameplay issues, and odd little quirks that players have come to accept with Bethesda games, not that this should be respected or praised, but it is a good game and one that every fallout loving gamer should play.… Expand "

So I've been dropped into Fallout 4 and 30 minutes into the game I'm immediately reminded WHY I hated New Vegas so much. Look at Fallout 4's Lexington or downtown Boston. These environments are extremely pleasing to look at, varied, and fun to explore. You can't walk around Fallout 4's wasteland without finding something you want to explore every few minutes. There's no unnecessary wasted space.  Having played Fallout 4 for 30 hours by now, I can say a lot of the criticisms in the user review section are obvious trolls. I've seen complaints about missing factions, well they're all there and then-some. I've seen so many new and insane enemies when travelling the eastern part of the map I was shocked by the sheer variety of things I've run into.  The gunplay is obviously improved. Modding guns is a new addiction. They've simplified the level system down to perks, an what experience points contributed to in Fallout 3/Vegas turned into perks with multiple levels themselves.  Overall everything is improved. This game is great. There are so many games I can't play for more than 10 hours total because I lose all interest in them.

Hopefully I'm not single by the end of my first run.  Main Character: I'm not the best at using these types of character creaters, however I feel I was able to make a decent looking chap to be my avatar in the wastes of Boston. The system, imo could have done with better hair options (both top and face) but that is fixed with finding books in game that give you more options.  Voice acting is good imo and for me gets me more involved in the character. While the old style of Bethesda having the silent hero worked I have always preferred the main character having their own voice ever since Mass Effect. Really gets me immersed into the world.  Game Play: The run and gun aspect isn't as solid as most FPS games out there, however VATS makes up for that imo. The controls are easy and for the most part the same as the previous games, which I like because it means muscle memory kicks in and allows me to just fall right back into the groove.  The radiation damage system change is actually very good. In FO3 and NV it didn't seem like something to really worry about at all, but now it actually has more of an effect.  Weapon crafting is by far a great improvement over the last two titles. Instead of using repair as a sing for extra weapons in the game, it is now a sing for upgrade parts that allow you to adjust your weapon to better suit your game play needs.  Settlement Building: This is really in depth with what you can do. However I haven't gotten to far into it because it has one major issue that causes it to be a huge pain, no birds eye view building system. If the building mode just allowed for different views and a freedom of movement within the boundaries of the settlement it would me leagues better than it is now. Still using it though.  Quests: The quests in this game vary. Some are just run of the mil clear out area X of X bad guys or go here and retrieve X item. But some of them are very special and are well worth putting the time into this game, can't say more because I want to keep spoilers down.  The World: First off, I agree with a lot of reviews in saying that the world feels smaller than the previous games. I get it, I get a sad feeling when I realize the size of the game world. However there is so much in the world that even though it seems small at times, it can feel huge. And one of the main things that makes it feel like this is all the random events that happen between point A and B. Makes the game feel lived in and that stuff is happening without you being there, though it really isn't the case.  Another great thing is how the world reacts to you. You do make an impact, people will say different things to you walking down the streets of Diamond City because of it. Raiders might even take notice of you taking out rival Raider groups. The impacts are small and big at the same time, which gives life to this game, gives the player immersion into the world and makes me as an RPG player feel pretty darn good.  Be warned, this is just like all the other open world Bethesda games, in that I mean there are bugs/glitches abound. But if you take them in stride and realize that you can't make a game this big without pitfalls then you'll be able to ease past them and enjoy the game. Plus updates and mods will always be there to fix that.  All in all I really like this game. Is it the best game ever made? No. Is it my favorite game of all time? No. But I didn't expect it to be, so I'm ok with it.… Expand "

Don't mind the circlejerk hate brigade about this game, it is fantastic. The new perk system really makes you choose how you want to play your character, a lot more so than previous fallout games where you could literally become master of everything relatively quickly. The story also has you make some hard choices when choosing your faction because they all have valid goals that can not overlap. The gun modding system is by far the best addition to the series though. I'm constantly looking around for scrap items so I can customize my guns. Combine that with the legendary weapon perks and you have an extremely fun way to hope for an amazing gun. I personally got lucky and got a hunting rifle with the perk ""Does double damage if the target is at full HP"" and I modded it to becomes a .50 sniper rifle with a silencer so I can sneak around picking off full HP targets stealthy from a distance.

The crafting is... weird. I suppose maybe it doesn't seem that much different or unusual for those who used the crafting options extensively previously. I didn't and it's mostly all new to me. I am enjoying the ability to mod my guns and armor as I see fit for my play style. The building and managing settlements may be a bit much. I don't dislike it exactly, I just think it may be a little overkill.  I have a lot of mixed feelings about the changes to the power armor. I understand how it makes sense. It needs to be powered, and that power is limited. It makes even more sense since the power armor is available so early in the game. So I do understand why it is like it is. I simply preferred the slap it on and be awesome of previous games.  So far the actual gameplay seems pretty standard. Kill raiders and mutated crap, collect piles of junk and useless crap and become a hoarder on a level to contend with those on reality shows. Make friends. Make enemies. Plenty to do on the side while focusing on a main goal. In the end, I've enjoyed Fallout since I played the first one and am enjoying it still. As long as I'm having fun, I'll keep on playing. And the one thing I think is absolutely best so far is the soundtrack. The way the music fits whatever your doing is perfect. And the first time it launches into the theme is very epic.… Expand "

The building system almost wants to build the whole thing for you and wont let you use enough creativity in the project to make it blend, not to mention to look yours in the commonwealth. The armor system wont let you take apart special armor and stack that onto something else which was disappointing. Another disappointment was the limited amount of armor that looks ok on your character and the layering system seems to also make you lose appreciation for customization.. no matter how cool that one part looks or is modded, it'll always look stupid with the other parts..

InfiniteYT,"Nov 16, 2015",6," Fallout 4 is a mixed bag, in it there’s an adventure around every turn and someone's story that you can uncover though the commonwealth, there are creatures a people that want nothing more then to see your dead body on the ground and to survive in the wasteland, and there are is a city which remains are burnt to a crisp by the great war 200 years ago. Fallout 4 has a lot to offer but withFallout 4 is a mixed bag, in it there’s an adventure around every turn and someone's story that you can uncover though the commonwealth, there are creatures a people that want nothing more then to see your dead body on the ground and to survive in the wasteland, and there are is a city which remains are burnt to a crisp by the great war 200 years ago. Fallout 4 has a lot to offer but with that brings a lot of consequences. Fallout 4 has a lot for you to do, whether you’re fighting off mutants, retrieving artifacts from the old world, uncovering secrets of the commonwealth, or building a shelter for a settlement. There’s a lot of content but the whole thing is held together by a single thread and is on the verge of falling apart. Fallout 4 is very buggy and can cause cheap death or sometimes unplayable missions. For example, I had to go with two people in a cave system under the city to loot a vault under Diamond City, to advance through the cave system I had to use this robot named Sonya to break through walls that look fragile. Unfortunately the robot would not break the final wall and I was unable to progress through the mission. Other bugs consist of getting stuck in a wall, enemies getting stuck in a wall, NPC’s heads in the camera when you're talking to them and graphical errors like pop in. Somehow though I was able to look past these bugs and found myself enjoying the game a lot. What I didn't enjoy was the overall look of the game. The graphics of Fallout 4 are very dated. This isn’t any more apparent than when you're in one of the skyscrapers in post apocalyptic Boston. Everything looks very low res and flat out ugly. It certainly does not help that game is using a engine that skyrim was made in 4 years ago and even then the graphical quality wasn’t that good. One thing I do like is that the art style is FAR better than previous Fallout games. Instead of using different shades of brown the environment has a lot more color while still maintaining the bleak no hope feel. Things the Nuclear Storms add a lot more to the environment and makes the atmosphere much better. Bugs and Graphics aside, Fallout 4 does a great job in storytelling.  Everyone has a story to tell and usually has you go on a mission where you also uncover things about the commonwealth or other people you may have met throughout the main story. The voice acting is amazing, comparing it to Fallout 3 or new vegas is no competition. I liked almost all the characters except one or two. As for characters themselves, there also very good and most characters have a distinct personality that makes them stick out and makes the wasteland have more life. he VATS system returns for Fallout 3 and New Vegas but this time it’s better. Time doesn't stop but instead is just slowed down making the action faster and keeps the game moving at a solid pace. Now you can scope and shoot and actually hit your targets instead of it being blind luck. This is my favorite change as it is not like an arcade shooter but gunfights are faster  and  more hectic like it would be in a wasteland.  Finding ammo is fairly annoying as I found myself at the end of missions with no ammo and dying a bunch of times before I finally was able to make it out. The perk system is simplified but for the better as everything is laid out in a way where it's easy to understand and use. Some gunfights can be very monotonous at times if you don’t have the right weapon and you might have no choice but to die. The new addition of building settlements is fun but doesn't impact the story in any way. Most people will go through the entire main story and barely touch it.  The building system is a great break in the action and can add hours of gameplay itself. The only problem is that is is no proper tutorial and there is a lot of trial and error. Building shelter can add people to your settlements and make them happier. You can also modify weapons to make them stronger. You can turn a normal 10mm Pistol into a hand cannon and annihilate any enemies in your way. One of my favorite things about Fallout 4 is the music. Whether it’s eerie sounds of wandering the wasteland of the victory tune that plays when you liberate an area from enemies it’s great. It really helps to set the mood of the game and I really feel that it is really overlooked by other people.The AI is not good. There actions cook like there robots instead of people (even though some are actually robots). They can easily get stuck or sometimes face the wrong way when talking to you. You can walk up someone, crouch, and pick pocket someone in the middle of diamond city and nobody will notice. Don’t even try to be stealthy without a stealth boy because enemies will spot you even if your toe is visible they will shoot you and hunt you down. Fallout 4 has a lot of flaws, but I was able to look over most of these and see what the commonwealth had to offer. Fallout 4 gets a 8.6/10… Expand "

Gameplay: A lot of fun, most of the elements that people have come to love about the fallout series are present, with the addition of settlements. Settlements: More could have been done here, it's enjoyable but feels very constrained compared to the rest of the game. Crafting: A nice improvement over earlier games, however many parts of the armor layer system feels inadequate. Conversation: This area was obviously meant more for the console crowd, talking with NPC's should've been expanded upon from previous games, not condensed. Combat: This hasn't really changed much from previous games and is one of my few true joys of this game. Junk: A VAST IMPROVEMENT, the mass quantities of junk in the world and now have one, this goes towards settlements and crafting and is a nice addition. Enemies: An improved A.I. over earlier games, higher difficulties feel more challenging instead of just being more difficult. Bugs: There seemed to be a lot of them early on in the game, CTD's and FPS problems mostly, but it seems that most of this was caused by resolution disparities between monitor and game, once those were synced up the problems disappeared. I have heard of many other quest related bugs that I have not personally come across, but it still seems that the game was released early without necessary fixes.

When you combine them together though... it just sucks you in. I can't recall the last game, that kept me chained to my PC for so long.

When you combine them together though... it just sucks you in. I can't recall the last game, that kept me chained to my PC for so long.  Graphics: nothing special compared to some titles this year in visuals department, but they do create a certain climate, which keeps you playing. Props to the game designers for not copy-pasting everything everywhere. Locations look different, they all have their style.  Story: You can clearly see moment, when story designers tripped over their own legs. Four options dialogues are acceptable, but sometimes the choices you pick have nothing to do with what the character says. Your character has a voice! A nice one too... :) I like the way story unravels and the plot twists. I'm so swamped in side quests however, that I didn't really push that forward too much. I hate the idea of repeating quests (like for the BoS), but they keep pointing me to new locations, which is nice. I wonder if they ever run out of them and I'm inclined to check :).  Building: This is actually the boring part. Yes, it's fun to build your own house. Even if it has to look like a shed (because there's no normal parts). Even if it's bugged and sometimes you have to redesign everything, because pieces, that should fit together just don't. It's not fun to run around all the encampments and keep building crap to make people happy. What kind of settlers are they if they can't even build themselves a bed? :)  Crafting: That's how you do it. It's really awesome.  Power armor: We all know how important that part is in every Fallout. I hated Power armor designs in F3 and FNV, they basically looked like jackets. Power armor should look like a tank on foot. We finally got it. A power armor, that looks like a tank. The fusion core system, which limits Power Armor usage is also very nice... but I'll end the game with a hundred cores left, because I'll hoard them till the end. Obviously ;).  Map: The map is really nice, even though it's small. I wouldn't complain about a bigger and emptier map. Sometimes things are right on top of each other and you have to zoom in to choose the proper location to fast travel to.  Companions: Not much to say yet, I spent most of my time with Codsworth the family robot. I really like Nick Valentine thouth. Then there's this lady from Combat Zone, which seems interesting, but I heaven't had the chance to meet her properly yet. The dog despite getting so much publicity is useless.  Character development: I like the new system. I liked the old system more. I liked F1-FT system even better. I started playing Wasteland 2 Director's Cut two days before I got F4 in my hands and it made the difference even easier to see. The new system is oversimplified. Also I found out you can actually choose any perk in the tree around level 24 and there's no respec. I grinded my way down the perk vault through skills I'm never gonna use. Thanks for the pro-tips Bethesda :).  In general there's nothing special about any part of the game, but as a whole it has its purpose and gives you a lot of fun.… Expand "

I was compelled to create an account for this purpose as the ""0"" ratings that flood the dataset are absolutely ridiculous and show that people are unable to use a scale from 0-10, where both 10 and 0 would be incredibly hard to justify.  A quick overview of my first hours. I am thus far very unsure on how to take the lack of skills here. In fact, I was positively upset when I saw how they have changed SPECIAL (e.g how you can add points every level. So far, I think it's a terrible decision. BUT(!) it is way to early to judge, and this is where in my opinion reviewers are letting initial disappointment getting the best of them. It's a big change, yes. As was the jump from F1&2 to F3. And I was sceptical there as well. So I will not judge the character building here until I have created and ""finished"" at least 2 distinct builds.  Moving on, the presentation is fantastic. People are bashing the graphics because it's what you do these days, I agree on the stiff animations, but the world and its atmosphere are amazing thus far. Comparisons to the witcher 3, which are abundant here, are difficult in my opinion: I have not looked at that world from a first person perspective. There are (presumably) less NPC's that you will have up close in your face which could explain the huge difference in facial animations. This is definitely the weak point of f4. Oh, and the music is fantastic.  The shooting mechanics are fine, vast improvements over f3 and nv. I haven't seen many weapons yet but the pipe rifles and 10mm and shotties so far are satisfying to use. I am sceptical about perk specialization but I cant be sure until I have tried to specialize.  The dog companion (refusing to call him dogmeat) is rather annoying, I ditched him ASAP as I prefer to explore alone and only bring companions when the battle mood of the quest permits it.  The voiced character issue - so far I don't like it that much, I preferred 1 / 2 / 3 / NV dialogue to this, a lot. In the end, however, I thought dialogue had only declined in quality since F2, and the exploration and immersion of the newer titles makes up for it somewhat.  I'll comment on the first 2 quests I did; they were fine, remiscent of TES and F3 style mysteries. I'm ok with that. The first impression overall was bad and then steadily improved.  Closing remarks - This game is big, and complex. The new characters system is in my opinion IMPOSSIBLE to be judged so quickly, we have to try it out and play with it some more. A game this big should be explored thoroughly, then judged. And change isn't automatically bad. At first I thought I wanted to play 3 and mostly NV while playing 4 - then realized that all playthroughs I started there in the last 2 years were left unfinished despite the gazillion cool mods simply because those games are a bit stale now. The combat is terrible once the novelty of the guns wears off, and you have to create artificial difficulty for yourself. Quests are often tedious. So let's wait and see how this one fares after we have really tried to use the new system and to really explore the world. 8/10 overall, which I consider an excellent score. Compared to the Witcher 3, I do agree that it falls short - IMO, the Witcher 3 is special and absolutely phenomenal. The comparison is unnecessary, however, as the games play dramatically different.… Expand "

It is comparable to Bioshock: Infinite. - The world is fun to explore, and is on par with 3 and NV. There is no shortage of cool easter eggs, and there are hundreds of areas to visit (some much bigger than others) - The diversity of creatures/enemies to fight is FAR better than in 3 and NV. There are still new variations that I am running into. - Weapon customization is interesting, and adds to the experience. - Yes, I am going to put the story in the ""pros"" section. It is interesting, enjoyable, and I feel that it has good replay value. - MOD FRIENDLY  Neutral - Some followers are interesting enough, but I feel Bethesda could have added a bit more depth to them. They can also prove useful in the wasteland (eg. One follower can pick almost all locks, another can hack most computers). Once you have ""befriended"" a follower, they also grant you a unique perk. However, most followers can be relatively buggy at times. - Base building is a cool feature, but it is relatively shallow and doesn't add much to the base experience of the game. It seems to be just another optional feature that you could either pour dozens of hours into, or ignore entirely. - Many of the base RPG elements in the game are dumbed down. For example, the levelling and stat allocation has been simplified. I've put this in the neutral area because this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The game feels more user friendly and is likely more accessible to more casual gamers.  Cons - The speech aspect of the game has been significantly dumbed down to the point where it is a step below FO: 4 and NV. - Doesn't seem to be as decision based as I had hoped. I haven't really encountered any game changing decisions yet after 40 hours of gameplay. This could however change as I progress further into the game.  Overall, FO:4 should be taken for what it is. A great exploration based shooter with a decent story, which incorporates RPG elements. The game is a blast, and I would recommend it to most gamers. Just a side note to anyone considering giving this game a 0 rating, consider that 0 is literally the lowest you can rate something. It means that the game has literally no redeeming qualities, and should have never seen the light of day. An example of a true zero is ""Big Riggs: Over The Road Racing"".… Expand "

Like, this game is the **** there is a reason why 400k people played it day1 on Steam (which is a new record and even bet GTA5). Now let's start with the good stuff, shall we?  -very polished, only 2 locations with minor framerate drops, otherwise 60fps 24/7 and I encountert only one single glitch, where a raider refused to stop bleeding -big and dense map to explore -story had a good entertaining start -shooting mechanics have improved significantly (without neglecting other aspects of the game) - the violence is delicious -difficultys are well balanced, I'm playing on hard right now, and got oneshoted a couple of times by mines and grenades -powerarmour, holy cow this thing is fun. Not only is the armour very fun to use, it is also very strong, yet you can't abuse it for it's running on some fusion cores that are very rare. Also it's destroyable and even has a damage modell.for it's different parts -modding is crazy, you're just picking up all the junk you find in the world and craft some cool chems or mods from it, like MacGyver, lol -voiced protagonist, new dialogue system and new (Bioshock like) lootsystem are improving the flow of the game, without dumbing it down. I hardly can remember a dialogue where I wasn't able to convince, persuade or force a person to give me more onformations and/or rewards. Charisma is viable now. -animations have improved as well, no longer will npcs just stand infront of you while you're talking to them, they are always doing something, always moving -little things like the waterdrops on your Powerarmor-HUD, animations when you drink from a river or when your character hacks sucksessfully a terminal he's always respondig to it, and to other actions. -weathersystem is great as well, you have rain, fog and even radiated storms  The bad stuff -dialogues and characters could have done better, it's still an improvement over Skyrim -it appears that the map is a bit smaller then Skyrim, can't imagine I'll need actually 400 hours to finish everything… Expand "

The game looks much better and its options can be easily tweaked to run smoothly and look gorgeous on my 5 years-old LAPTOP with nVidia 555m. If you have even worse than that - it's only your fault. The only minus here is to colorful sights, unlike in previous Fallout games. But maybe I just get used to Fallout 3 and New Vegas filters :) Though the music helps to create the needed atmosphere. 2. Bugs. Well, there are some. But no one is gamebreaking and overall the game is much more stable than ANY Bethesda game before it (at least staring with Fallout 3). During my 25 hours gameplay I had ONE crash-to-desktop. There is nothing to compare with the latest Witcher, which was in fact worse than Unity talking about bugs and optimization, but somehow people ignored that. 3. The world isn't that big, but there is much to do, I also like the main plot very much, partly because I was waiting for something with ""androids"" for a long time :) The only minus (a BIG one) for me is that (again, unlike in recent previous Bethesda games) we are given a character with strongly pre-defined story. Not like Witcher (thanks god), but still, and you can't even choose anything except gender. I'm not interesting in having some stupid son an ""saving"" him, at all. But I STILL has some hope about that. UPDATED. There is no hope. And this is just one HUGE minus for me. The newest Bethesda games always provided the strong role-playing where YOU define your character. But now it feels almost if I play Geralt - the character's story is STRONGLY pre-defined and it actually influences the whole game and plot. Disappointed. 4. I have no complains about gameplay mechanics and RPG system. They work, so it's enough for me. I was skeptical about new crafting (I mean building of settlements), but in fact I liked it! There are also many little nuances that made experience even greater for me - voiced main character, interesting companions and NPCs that looks very alive (for example, if you hold too long the dialogue, they will ask you if you want to continue talking from time to time), animated quest narrations. Well-known (black) humor of Fallout games is also there. UPDATED: oh, and of course I love to see many of the mods' ideas implemented in the game. I won't spoil the names, but while playing and seeing one or another ""new"" element I can even recall a name of the mod or modder that had the particular idea in previous games!  RPG OTY. Maybe would give it a 9, but it seems some fanboys of either Witcher or older Fallout games are being unfair. Oh, well. 10 it is. UPDATED. No, it IS worth 10, absolutely. Despite the minus I've mentioned earlier. It is a rare game where I had to think so deeply and carefully about my choices. I even had to turn off my game several times to think more. And the ""endings"" (though we know there is no actual ""end"")... I can't stop rethinking after them. That's what I call hard choices! Good job!… Expand "

You actually feel the improvement of your character, and the new features (voice character, housing, new craft system, etc...) They are all just amazing and brilliant!  The graphics are, from my opinion, actually pretty good. As a 3d gaming modeler myself, I will say that the lighting is very well rendered for a game with such a dynamic world (If you don't agree with that you probably don't realise how dynamic Fallout 4 world is, or you just don't know what it means.)  I don't like to give games such a great score, but I think this one deserve WAY better than what a bunch of hating moaning players is writing there. The score will probably go up soon, because haters are rushing on metacritic to puke their hatred, and the good players are still enjoying the game, when they will finish it, they will come here and make the score go up.  Not sure to understand why some guys don't like it, don't mix quality and nostalgia, friends. Previous Fallouts also got a place in my heart, but you can't say this game is bad. You just can't, it's in vain, sorry :)  I don't know if FO4 is better than Skyrim, probably not. Skyrim is different by so many aspects, and I rather play a heroic fantasy, but damn! FO4, wow!

But others, just plain **** First off, the graphics. No, Fallout 4 is not a bad looking game but it is not a very good looking game either. It is a visually decent looking game with some nice effects like volumetric lightning. And this is on the technical side, meanwhile, on the art direction Fallout 4 is a delight for the eyes. Where Fallout : New Vegas was a great game it was also deeply lacking what Bethesda knows best, WORLD BUILDING. The Mojave desert was just a horrible place to visit, completely dull and bad looking on almost every side. Even Vegas was a pain for the eyes by times. Here the world seems real and is interesting in it's construction. A pleasure to explore and to discover.  The combat, usually Bethesda games are not well known for their combats. But this time, it's top notch. It has true fps mechanics, the feedback is really good and the gunfeeling is excellent (special mention for the laser guns).  The hand to hand & co combat is also interesting but lacks a little something. Where Skyrim combats were just okay with some very fun moments, Fallout 4 tries another approach where you can no longer just keep blocking like a retard and have to time your blocks and attacks just like a game such as Dark Souls. As i'm a big fan of Souls i get a bit of that Souls vide in Fallout with the close combat at Survival difficulty. Yeah, pain is my thing...  Dialogue and Story wise, Dialogue might indeed seem dumbed down with four choices and sometimes actually feel like it and actually be on occasions. But the no & yes is still here, and you can be an absolute dick if you want... People saying you can only play the ""good guy"" are dumb, they usually also yell at the fact that there is no karma system anymore. But let me say this. THE KARMA SYSTEM WAS THE MOST IDIOTIC SYSTEM FALLOUT 3 HAD. A world such as fallout is so much more interesting being all gray, defining it with good and evil is just stupid and dumb down you character and the world around to ""Oh, i'm the bad guy !"" or ""I'm the good guy, love me!"". No, Fallout is a world where you should make choices and live with it. I hate to do something i think is the right thing for me and somebody else and have the game tell me i'm a bad boy or good guy for it. With that said, back to the dialogues. So no you still have options and possibilities, and you get new dialogue options IF you get your charisma higher. If you don't have the right charisma level some options will not show up. So for the story, since this could be pretty long and i've already typed a lot of **** i'm gonna do quick. The story is slow paced and almost **** for the first half of it. But the last part, oh boy. If you've been paying attention and didn't just rush but actually took your time to explore and meet the ""right"" people out there you'll see that you will get many new and different option in the main story line. There's a few different endings with different choices to make depending on your actions with the different factions of the game and i got my hart torn appart because of those choices. I had to chose to kill npcs i didn't want to kill and that made me feel bad... In a good way. A way i felt i got really into it... And wasn't the hero nor the bad guy. Just a man, who had to make choices...  and that's just bits of the game, the settlements are a very good addtion to the recipe of Bethesda games but lack polishing at some point but is still guite fun and give lots of posibilites (and the mods that are gonna come... oh boy...), crafting is complete and nice, character creation is incredible and dogmeat rules. (with the glitches, especially with the glitches. Beth', let Dogmeat keep his glitches please...)  Also to the ""fan boys"" of Fallout 1 & 2. Understand that Bethesda is giving their interpretation of Fallout (Fallout 1/2/NV = West Coast & Fallout 3/4 = East Coast).… Expand "

There are quite a lot of bugs and the game doesn't feel polished.  I've had the game crash probably 3 times in my 80 hours of gameplay.  The settlement UI is not intuitive at all, and most of the time I had to resort to looking up how to do things on the internet.  I was looking forward to crafting weapons and found I had to invest heavily in the modding perks and scavenging perks to be able to do anything useful with a weapons bench.  As an example, there are 4 levels of armor crafting, 4 levels for guns, 4 levels of science for energy stuff, 4 levels of blacksmith for armor and melee, then you can't craft anything without parts, so you'll need to invest into the scavenger perk.  You can actually finish the game before lvl 20, so that's a significant investment just to mod your equipment.  A lot of the side quests become very repetitive (especially the minutemen quests).  But, if you put all the problems the game has aside, I really had a lot of fun playing it.  I started up successful settlements to generate scrap and money, the power armor is totally OP now (it's not just another piece of armor; it's like a tank), there are goofy quests, and some great characters.  I based my score on how much fun I've had compared to other games I've bought recently.  If you like fallout 3 and exploring the wasteland, you're going to enjoy this.

Instead of the ""everything grey and screwed"" look it's now got some proper coloring and all in all a nice atmosphere. I can only assume that the negativity towards the graphics come from the facial details which I would say come from the style.  The crafting system got a nice overhaul and instead of carrying around 5 guns of the same type to keep one alive you now scrap materials from whatever you find to lie about. Found an ashtray? You can use that, because it's ceramic. Found a toaster? Well, nice that's got springs and steel. You don't need to repair your gun either, instead you now feed it with new upgrades to increase accuracy, damage, reload time, range, you name it.  Hunter/Gathering works really well too because you can drop off any scrap you find in your workshop at wherever you build your base then with a single button. So you don't have to manually search for all the crap in your inventory and transfer it through 10 containers. Instead just transfer it into your workshop and that's it.  And last but not least: The armor suit finally makes sense and is its own little feature.  But that's about it with the improvements really.  What is so disappointing? To begin with - the game feels exactly like the predecessors. And I mean, exactly - including the same old bugs, the non-immersive dialogues and the half-assed voice acting. The standards in this regard simply aren't up to date.  The base building is, to put it simple: really bad. The modules all look like crap. Intentionally of course but I'm not a major fan of it. A bigger issue is that the modules aren't compatible with each other. There's one wall I'd like to use on top of a floor where there used to be a house. There's no corners for it, and the corners all have floors which I don't need of course. The walls I want to use always snap next to each other so I can't build a corner with them myself either. All in all I had more fun building a base in ARMA II Epoch, ARK, or any other game that has a modular base building system. It's not that hard really since indy devs get it right. Bethesda simply sucks at it.  Bottom line - it's an improved version of Fallout 3/New Vegas with proper graphics. Aside from that it's senseless quest grinding with stock voice acting and dull dialogues. Is it a bad game? No. But aside from the highly improved graphical improvements it's got not much to offer compared to its predecessors.… Expand "

TeddieL,"Nov 12, 2015",9," I love this game. Many old Fallout-fans hate this game because how different it is compared to the other Fallout games.

I don't think that's a bad thing. It really made a game I liked, with a good mix of Action and Sandbox RPG.  Many people started to get angry when they realized there was only 4 conversation options and how the main character was not you, because there was a voice actor. I felt fine hearing Codsworth actually saying my real name, I don't really know why people got so mad when all they got were 4 options when Fallout 3 and NV had many different options but did lead to the same conversation.  As i said before, I liked the new Mass Effect like conversation system. I think the voice really added some meaning in the conversation, because you can hear your character say it. I thought the voice acting was good and the writing was also good.  The story was good, there was alot of different ways to complete the main story, as there is in the other Fallout games with a lot of different factions to join to help their cause and what they believe the wasteland should turn into.  The combat was fun and satisfying to play with and I loved the new crafting system with the new scraping system. The only problem was that you didn't want to drop any scraps because of the material which resulted in you having to get over encumbered quite often.… Expand "

The bugs are hardly game breaking, especially if you take steps to prevent them, and the graphic, while nothing marvelous, are an obvious improvementI'd like to start this off by saying that I suspect all the negative scores are the result of repeat accounts, or of people who haven't actually played the game. If you've seen gameplay, or played it yourself, you should know this to be true. The bugs are hardly game breaking, especially if you take steps to prevent them, and the graphic, while nothing marvelous, are an obvious improvement over FO3, FO:NV, and Skyrim. The optimization could be better, but I feel as if this is a problem not to just for PC, but for console as well.  Whatever my thoughts may be, please just take that into consideration. I've played the game for well over twenty hours at this point, and have been playing Fallout since 1999: I know what I'm talking about. The fact that the user rating is lower than New Vegas is **** absurd, and should be disregarded.  Pros:  - Gameplay is far better than it has been in previous titles, with mechanics that actually allow for a 'no V.A.T.S' play through. It obviously isn't destiny, but for an RPG, especially one made by Bethesda, it's a refreshing change.  - You're not going to find better graphics than Witcher 3 in this game, but this highly stylized version of Boston is still gorgeous. Bethesda has reached the apex of world design here, pulling out all the stops - a new story is hiding behind every corner.  - Voice acting is incredible. Whether or not you're a fan of the silent protagonist (which I am, to some extent)  is irrelevant; Brian DeLaney and Courtney Taylor have both put a lot of passion into this, as well as the entire supporting cast. Everyone is giving their all, and it's wonderful to listen to.  - Companions are diverse and well thought-out. Everyone has a backstory, and none disappoint in complexity. The friendship/romance system is also a welcome addition.  - The soundtrack... wow. Just... just wow. Not just the radio stations: Inon Zur is at his very best here.  - The new leveling system is far better than any previous installment of the 3d series. It add a level of depth and customization that would be extremely hard to top. Don't let anyone else fool you, this makes the game far more engaging. Speaking of which...  - It's far more difficult. I could have put this as a con as well, but I despised the easy nature of both NV and FO3. While the lack of a hardcore mode is irritating, this is made up by the fact that ammo is scarce, and enemies are tough. The challenge, however, is usually well worth it.  - Finally, the story - what can I possibly say about it that hasn't already been said? It's dynamic, it's engaging: it's a work of art, frankly. The moral choices are difficult and game-changing, the scope is incredible, and the writing is award worthy. The third act is truly what stands out, though this is not to diminish just how fun the first two parts are - I won't spoil anything, but you're all in for a very special treat. The replayability alone is just incredible.  Cons:  - The bugs are numerous, as one would expect. If you don't download the beta update and (if you're playing in NVIDIA) disable streamer, then you'll not only find that your frame rate is practically non-existent, but you'll experience crashes that should've been patched day one of development.  While almost everything is fixable in one way or another, it's still a very notice inconvenience that needs to be rectified as soon as possible.  - The animations, especially facial, are improved, but that isn't really saying much. It still looks like garbage when someone is trying to speak, and while we all sorta expected it, it's a shame to see that our fears were legitimized.  - The pacing at first is... wonky. As I said before, I'm not going to spoil anything, but it just seems like it's trying to haphazardly rush you into the wasteland as fast as possible. It'll probably be fixed by the modding community, but that's certainly no excuse.  Verdict: 9/10  A gem of a game, and easily one of the best, if not the best, games to come out of BGS since Morrowind. Everything is diverse, dynamic, and engaging; truly world design at it's finest. While the bugs can be a nuance and the pacing is off at the beginning, they hardly constitute a low score. You can see every ounce of passion and love that was put into this project, and the picture it paints is absolutely breathtaking.  My advice? Buy as quickly as you can and jump right in. This is one hell of a treat, and you won't be disappointed.… Expand "

The bad: Voice acting of some npcs like codsworth is fantastic but some other characters not so much. The textures are not that good, they are not horrible but they are not great. The dialog system has been simplified and sometimes you say something you didn't want to say because the description did not explain what you were going to say. Building the settlements is a little wonky because of the grid. Some quest are very repetitive (go here, kill that or go here, kill them, collect that)  I have heard a lot of people had lots of trouble with this game. Both with performance and bugs.

The new perks system seems a lot less ""RPG"" than the last one, the Map is smaller but more dense than the ones before and i can't really find a purpose for the new ""minecraft"" system they got going on, at the moment.

The main story line is a bit flimsy and anticlimactic, but what are you gonna do. The graphics aren't all that stunning, but i'm sure the mods will take care of that in the near future. There were a couple of things done better here, than in the previous games like the battle and crafting systems, better animations and movement (Skyrim level, maybe a bit better) there are a lot more open buildings which lessens the need for loading, essentially making the gameplay a lot smoother. The battle system i especially like because it seems more realistic than the ones in F3 and NV. In the previous games i felt as if the hit box and enemy reaction to taking damage (or lack thereof) were somewhat weird, which prompted use of VATS, in turn making the game a bit ""distant"". The crafting is also nice, armor and weapon creation is similar to Skyrim, but with more depth. I found the fact that the character is an established person, rather than a blank slate, in the game world, a tad impersonal to the player, but it's not a deciding factor in the gameplay so i guess it doesn't matter. The game world seems more alive, although i think the AI would benefit from some more development.  In summation, there is a lot to be seen and experienced in Fallout 4, especially to new players. That said, if i were a new player, i'd do some review reading before i decide if this is what i really want.  My opinion is that it's a good, if not great, game.

Being alone in a world, starting with almost nothing while eventueally becoming overpowered and the fact that it had both melee and gun combat.  - The story so far (haven't finished it) is not that interesting. Especially compared to Fallout new vegas. But ah well you know what I wrote in the last point.  By the way: for the people that say that the quest are all the same, have just been doing quartermastery and minutemen quests. Those are just to grind xp and cash, kind of like the bounties in Skyrim. There are neough side quests to find that have their own stories and outcomes. You just have to find them.  - Graphics, well meh. I expected better. They are not BAD but definetly not what you'd expect from a 2015 game. Performance on pc is sometimes also a bit questionable.  Shaders are ok, post-processing is good to really good, the rest not really. Textures and models, please. So horrible sometimes.  - I need more adhesive and aluminium! Seriously the amount of aluminium and adhesive that you need in this game compared to the amount that you get is kind of messed up, especially adhesive.  - I still haven't found a good trader to sell all my stuff to. All the merchants have like 300 caps or less! So annoying.  plus:  - I LOVE the new combat. As someone that never uses V.A.T.S. because honestly, I think it is very lame and ruins the whole shooter aspect of the game (and think that it is an excuse for people with poor aim to get out of sticky situations, not trying to be rude here). Now that guns actually feel like guns the game feels complete for me in that area. Also, sprinting!  - The world itself is a lot better than in previous fallout games. Boston and it's surrounding villages and cities actually feel legit. Not just like randomly placed assets. Also, some of the indoor areas are big enough for 30 minutes or more gameplay.  - The guns and crafting are excellent in my opinion. Trust me that once you get to the good part of crafting, your weapons can become completely different and twice as powerful. Power armor is a bit OP at start so i skipped it at first, but started to use it from around level 25 once I found my first good armor set.  - Characters are ok I guess. Then again, I am not that harsh when it comes to these things.  - Base building is fun, but a bit wonky sometimes.  - Perk system is fine, but different. Some changes are not always bad people. I kind of miss the skill system from FNV but I accept this change because it is not a bad system. This is a thing that many people just don't think about.

Major step backwards. - While the UI and buttons are streamlined, it still feels worse than before using M+K. Mainly with this 4-way dialogue. - I don't agree with the power armor up front. Yes it felt cool, but now it just sits in the garage because it really eats fusion cores. If I wanted a ""heavy"" character, I would dislike the battery search. Also...it's a fusion core that powers large turbines for 200 years, but powers your suit for 2 hours? - While base building is nice, it seems like a gimmick (almost forced), and wouldn't fit at all when I do a ""evil"" play-through. IDK, maybe they wont go to sanctuary when I do that play-through. - Weak opening goal....seriously, the gunshot they chose is like a cheap jump-scare in horror games. Is that the best you could do? A cheap tug at human instincts?  Side thoughts on the fusion cores: I wonder if there are enough cores in the default world to roleplay a heavy character through an average play-though. I bet not. If someone told me Bethesda almost went to micro transactions with fusion cores as the forerunner, I would believe it. It explains the ""giving"" of the armor rather than earning, and the short lifespan of the cores. If that happened, it would shoot my score down to a 4/10, as it would kill my immersion on any play-though.  Performance: At first I gave a test on Ultra. I averaged 40-60 FPS with some dips to 26FPS when large groups popped-in. After turning off God Rays and scaling back some distances, mainly shadows (biggest impact), I rarely drop below 50FPS. Then again, AMD hasn't released any drivers yet and it was built for NVIDIA gameworks. This could change in the future. I did not unlock the Framerate Cap.  Had to open .ini for FOV change and removing mouse acceleration.  I am disappointed in the Config screen....missing a ton of options. It's now all Low-Medium-High-Ultra.  ==Lessons Learned=== - The 'missing perks' are now magazines scattered about the wastes.  I think this is better than generic +5 boosts of previous games.  - You can move mods from one weapon to the other without paying the rare resources again:  10mm #1 has a scope and you want it on 10mm #2.  Customize 10mm #1 and switch out the scope for ironsights.  This makes the scope a 'mod item' in your inventory.  Go to 10mm #2 and give it the scope....no resources needed.… Expand "
kingADZ12,"Nov 12, 2015",8," Having around 80 hours played so far, I feel that this game is a fantastic game if you separate it from the previous Fallout games.  Also, ikr! An 8/10? Am I an alien or something? Because, you know, like 95% of Metacritic users only seem to know the numbers 0 and 10. "

Reputation was one of the things that made the series what it is today and i blindly expected it to be there. Instead of just blasting everything around you without worry like now in Fallout 4. If you desired to stay friendly or the opposite in Fallout3/New Vegas, you often selected your targets more carefully.  Durability/repairs: i had a discussion on this subject and most people were happy that they no longer had to carry 3 of each item around in order to repair which i can relate to. However they seem to have forgotten that there was alternative methods to repair, like using repair kits that tends to be rare in the beginning or vendors(even more with mods). I still do not see this as a valid reason to strip down something that has always added depth and realism, unless you were expecting to play a modern First Person Shooter.  Dialogue: In the previous games as i recall Fallout 3 and New Vegas, you could see how much of each special were needed in to progress further in that part of the dialogue, if you had less than that you could simply not pick it or sometimes they would give you a different answer than if you had the special requirements.  If you prefer the action elements over rpg then this is probably the best game you will touch for a very long time, however i know most of the old timers play it solely for the rpg and for that i have to give it a 7 until i see some or all of the missing features added.… Expand "

I have been a big fan of Bethesda's open-world sandboxy role playing games ever since I picked up Morrowind back in the early aughts, and I genuinely believe that Fallout 4 represents a particularly well thought out leap forward in the evolution of these games in general. It's huge, and I could talk about it for a long time, but that would be lame, and could get weird, so I will keep it as concise as possible.  First, yes, they completely redid the format used to deal with player stats. Gone is the big, long screen full of 0-100 player ability scores for like fifty different skill categories or whatever. No, they didn't get rid of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes (Strength, Perception, etc.) Those are still present. And they didn't actually do away with the complexity and customization-rich character building system made possible by those stats. Not really. In the place of these stats is a perk interface that sort of rolls it all into one big system that is... different, and a little more user-friendly. You could say it's been dumbed down a bit for the masses, but I don't think that's actually the case, and I certainly don't think that the game really suffered because of these changes, and neither should you unless you're just super married to the more pencil-and-paper rpg feel that the old system produced.  Also, yes, they did remove weapons and armor degradation, which results in there no longer being a repair system, or a repair skill for that matter, and yes, to be honest, at first glance this does look like a step back from role playing in general and perhaps something of an advance into more action/shooter territory. Actually, it's weird that I'm not exactly faulting them for this particular change because I was pretty bummed out with Skyrim at release for this very reason...  ...but that's honestly about it as far as anything that could potentially appear to be dilution or simplification.  And here is the deal:  They've added SO much more to the game's complexity than they've taken away. These additions come chiefly in two forms, these being 1) the player's ability to design, build, and manage survivor settlements, and 2) a truly robust crafting system.  To me, it also seems like the design of the whole wasteland itself was done so, so, so much more painstakingly than it was in previous titles. They somehow manage to make the environments diverse, colorful, and vibrant, despite the entire game taking place in a post-nuclear-apocalyptic mess of rubble and body parts. Also, there is weather. I mean, honestly...it's a really, really good game. If you liked Fallout 3 and New Vegas, then you should like this. A lot.  Sorry, I ran out of desire to keep writing.… Expand "

Frankly I have almost no interest in becoming the Hero of Kvatch or Chosen One or Dragonborn or whatever.  Best time I've had in a game ever was by simply running around Skyrim and installing fishing mods.  I write my own character story line and the less the designers interfere, the better.  Particularly since none of them are ever any good at crafting story arcs or providing real drama.  So on that basis, I do enjoy Fallout 4.  You can run around and snoop with few barriers in your way.  I've been sending a robot around to kill off bandits at various military bases because I like giant robots and dislike bandits.  Not many games will let you do that kind of thing outside any top-down plot.  I haven't found it to be badly bugged.  It's bugged, of course, but nothing too game breaking.  The NPCs stand on the roof.  It's funny.  If it wasn't bugged I'd miss these kinds of bugs.  The crafting system is fun but way too easy and unearned.  I like the weapons mods as well, and the fact that you can do your own aiming pretty well.  There are a lot of different play styles possible.  On the down side, I haven't found the NPC's particularly interesting or flexible.  They tend to repeat a lot.  The companion AI is still hilariously goofy, though from time to time your sidekick will suddenly be uber-effective.  Then it's right back to running in front of you.  It's worth the money for the simple reason that you can get hundreds of hours of fun out of it.  And because we should be encouraging more sandbox games and fewer ""gamey"" games where the developers hold our hand the whole time.  If you don't like the plots to this Fallout, just ignore them.  The plot to Skyrim was stupid too and ridiculously easy.  But that was never the point to these games.… Expand "

Exploration is kind of fun in FO3, but has no purpose rather then looking at places and accessing logs. Whereas in FO4, on top of what you did in FO3, you have chance to get gear or junk for crafting, and on top of that, the game has much better gun-play, which also makes exploring more fun. The only downside of FO4 compared to FO3, is the dialogue system and the linearity of its quests. But most of the time, like in FO3, you will shoot **** ""Oh but dude, this is an RPG, not a shooter game like Call of Duty, rite?"" you may ask. Well my friend, just compare the RPG elements of FO3 to FO2, then FO4 to FO3. FO3 doesn't feel like COD but FO4 does? The point is, shooting is a big part of both of those games, one game has a superior gun-play compared to the other, and the ****-gun-play game is not even that good, when compared to a game like New Vegas.  I really want to criticize the **** out of this game, but FO4 has so many flaws that it is impossible to fit the characters inside this box. Most of the problems are solved with mods anyways, so I will talk about  the game very little and shallow.  Karma gone - good Repair gone - good Skills gone - better (you put everything to 2 skills before) Perks gone - worse New skill tree - good and bad (some talents are mandatory but the tree design opens possibilities) VATS is slow time - good and bad No VATS grenade - bad VATS as general - same No influence on factions - bad No disguise - bad Player voice actor - good and bad (good acting but sometimes unexpected results) Companions - better Companion quests - better Graphics - better Gun-play - better Combat - better DR system - better and worse (fixed by mods) Dialogues - worse (kinda fixed by mods) Choices - worse Factions - worse (compared to NV, plus some of them make no sense) AI - still bad Stealth - still bad Crafting - good Weapon/armor mods - good Legendary enemies - good Legendary loot - good and bad (bad for disappointment) Settlements - good but broken (mods are cool) Quests - better and worse (gun-play and exploration is better but choices are limited) Main Story - **** Map design - better Mobs - better NPCs - worse (than NV), better (than FO3) Builds - better Survival - good Healing system - better Immersion - worse (than NV), better (than FO3) Towns - worse (than NV), better (than FO3) Animations - better Trading - worse (some items are impossible to buy, fixed by mods) DLCs - better **** mods - better   Aaaand that is it.… Expand "

Actually, that kind of sums up my feelings on FO4. Meh, can't be bothered.  Played through the main mission once (BoS line), and honestly can't be bothered to play through again. I have no investment in the settlement building, as all it nets me is more random NPCs to give me more radiant quests.  Actually, the game seems to rely WAY too much on the radiant quest system. It was dull in Skyrim, and it is dull here. Really wish Bethesda would do away with relying on it so much.  Didn't really care for the companions, they all seemed pretty dull (though that was, for me: Nick Valentine, Piper, Curie, the NCRlite guy and Dogmeat)  And I honestly have no idea why the Institute or Synths are supposed to be bad other than people have told me they are bad. I couldn't muster up the energy to feel ANYTHING for them, though in saying that, couldn't muster up any energy to feel for anyone in the game.  From a technical standpoint, the game is decent. I didn't suffer anywhere near as many CTDs as former Bethesda games, but the story and the factions were pretty lackluster, and the twists were mostly projected from miles away.  Giving the character a backstory too… honestly, FO3 did a great job of it, FO:NV gave us a complete blank slate… Fallout 4… I dunno, was I supposed to feel something for the animatronic baby? Was I supposed to scream in horror as my husband/wife was shot and killed and my baby taken? Hell, the most I know about my partner was that I chose to play as the other gender. Also, they had a wedding ring that I held onto incase it was useful, but it wasn't.

Bethesda really needs to get a better engine to develop their games on. If you do not have a decent PC i recommend waiting for patches (Whether official or unofficial) to help steady the performance for this game (As of the release of this Review there has already been a patch from Bethesda that has somewhat helped performance).  The Story: The story is nothing amazing but is generally a descent story with some cool twists. The ending, on the other hand, is very poor, with almost no player choice. (SPOILERS)While you can choose which faction to go with and whether or not to blow up the institute it really boils down to 1. Save the Institute 2. Blow up the Institute. And with either choice you get the same ending cut scene(End of Spoilers).  The World: The world in Fallout is a pretty big world, not much bigger from previous Fallout games but it is packed with things to do and random events all over the world, it feels very alive. Settlements is a pretty cool side activity though depending on the type of player you are it will get boring fast and the UI for it is pretty bad. There are tons of side quests and a lot of which have pretty interesting plots some of which even more interesting than the main campaign.  The Gameplay: The shooting in this game has been massively improved from New Vegas, it is easily one of if not the best improvements from the previous Fallout. While it can't stand up to entirely FPS focused games, it is massively improved and now provides some intense and fun action.

Don’t misunderstand me, I actually appreciate the effort put on those speech lines, but man, what the actual **** This is one of the weirdest choices ever made on a sequel, and the reason is simple: because of this the dialogue wheel exists. And this is clearly a step backwards  at one of the points which made this experience big in the past. All dialogue choices are reduced to Yes/No/Doubt/Sarcasm. This wouldn’t bother me if they had some kind of ramification on dialogues, but no, no ramification whatsoever. And the point is, and here’s where I feel completely fooled, those dialogue choices very often end up with the same answer by the NPCs.  This is more than a mistake, I don’t know why Bethesda threw away dialogue choices, if not entire dialogues, under some lines that no one asked for. Lines which also create a huge disconnect from the environment; I am hearing a voice that is not mine, telling lines that in most cases I didn’t chose due to the lack of information of the dialogue interface. And I feel like, if they kept the old formula, the game would have not only more speech lines, but entire dialogues that would fill the Commonwealth with interaction and, obviously, choices.  Choices that are conspicuous by absence, something that you will notice when you get along with one faction. There are 4 factions at the game, three of which are relevant to the development of the plot. Well, guess what: these factions are mutually exclusive. No matter how you face the game, when you align with one of this three factions you will be forced to destroy the other two.  This really pisses me off because Fallout 4 relies too much on its main storyline while side quests are barely remarkable. Of course, there are some awesome  side quests, but in most of the cases they are just dull fetch quests, some of them consisting on  doing the same thing over and over, and… oh my god, are you ****ing serious? Those quest have no end! And by leveling you will get to the point where these boring, repetitive and infinite quests almost do nothing to help you leveling up!

Mallenlane,"Nov 14, 2015",9," These reviews are ridiculous. Most of these people have never reviewed any other game, came on here to say 'me too'.  The game is fun. The graphics are pretty good for a game, which unlike nearly all other games, can't know which assets will be on screen at any given time. People like to compare to games which are not remotely doing the same things. "
senopah,"Nov 19, 2015",10," I had a little bit of trouble getting it to work properly at the start but I've just played the last 10 hours straight and this game is fantastic.  Yes, they've changed some things from the last go-around but despite all of the complaints on here, it's a great game that still very much has that Fallout feel.

Masked_One7240,"Nov 12, 2015",8," TL;DR version near bottom.  After having waited a good 4 years, I can say that I was really excited for this game.

I will actually have to say that I have only encountered one bug so far (weapon disappearing from hands). Other than that I have found the performanceTL;DR version near bottom.  After having waited a good 4 years, I can say that I was really excited for this game. Many people are talking about this game saying things like it crashing on start-up or just being a really bug-ridden game. I will actually have to say that I have only encountered one bug so far (weapon disappearing from hands). Other than that I have found the performance brilliant.  First I'd like to get all of the bad stuff out of the way. As many of you have heard Fallout 4 has taken the RP out of RPG. Yes this is the case. In previous games you had your S.P.E.C.I.A.L attributes (which range from 1-10) and a set of skills (ranging from 0-100 which you could increase when you level up). You could also choose a perk every level in Fallout 3 and every two levels in Fallout: New Vegas. This has been changed so that when you level up you get a single perk point which you can use to invest in either a single S.P.E.C.I.A.L attribute to rank it up by 1 or you can use it to get a perk. I honestly dislike this due to the fact that this doesn't allow for Role-Playing, where you might boost up your speech and barter to create a smooth-talker or you could boost your melee weapons and survival to role-play a tribal. Another thing I'm not quite a fan of is the voiced protagonist. Honestly I would like to commend Brian T. Delaney and Courtney Taylor (the male and female voice actors) for doing such a good job with the voices, but the reason I don't like the voiced protagonist is due to the fact that once again I can't role-play. The last factor which I dislike is the far too early retrieval of the Power Armour. In previous games you used to have to do a bunch of quests or get a special perk in order to use Power Armour. However, in Fallout 4 within about half an hour of starting the game (supposing you don't take three whilst creating your character) you are given both a suit of T-45d Power Armour and a mini-gun. I will have to say though that they have managed to try to balance this out by limiting the use of the Power Armour with Fusion Cores, which you insert in the Power Armour and then are drained whilst using it. Unfortunately this was poorly done and I found myself with 6 of them within about 5 hours of the game.  Now onto the positives. As I have said before I disliked the new levelling system, however, what quickly made up for it was the abundance of perks with 70 base perks, each with multiple ranks. Now the graphics. Many people are saying that the graphics aren't the greatest and I will have to agree with them, although what they are is an improvement from Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, and this is what matters. The settlement building was one of the features I was quite interested in and I have found it to be quite good, with various areas you can discover and build on. I haven't used it too much (mainly because I'm horrible at designing buildings) but from what I have built I can say that it was very well implemented. Now the dialogue wheel. Many people are saying that it has been dumbed down and once again, I have to agree. But instead of complaining about it, I think that we should be asking Bethesda in possibly a future DLC to include an option to switch between the New Vegas/3 style of dialogue and the new Fallout 4 style. The combat has also been greatly improved. In previous Fallout games most people had to rely upon V.A.T.S in order to be able to actually hit enemies. In Fallout 4 however, this is not the case. Fallout 4 has added various FPS mechanics such as a grenade hot-key, a bash key and weapon iron sights, vastly improving the experience. The open world is (in my opinion) what really made this game amazing. From the moment you leave Vault 111 you can do anything you want.  TL;DR version: Fallout 4 is filled with various great gameplay features, improved graphics and things to do. Only negatives are lack of RPG aspects and voiced character. Definitely deserves a play.

Overall Fallout 4 is like a reskin of the older games. Mechanics, user interface, mission styles, environment, they're all very familiar if you've played the previous titles. For some this might be a good thing but to me personally it shows a lack of innovation. Whilst I am enjoying the game it just doesn't feel 'next gen', I was hoping for more fluid animations, 2015 graphics, or at least a more friendly UI especially for us PC users. Fallout 4 is nothing more than a recycle with a new story.  PC performance hasn't been too good either. I'm running the game on a GTX 980Ti and considering the underwhelming graphics (not that Fallout 4 is entirely about graphics anyway) the requirements are stupidly high. Indoors frame rate is fine, but once outdoors it drops, the fluctuation can be somewhat frustrating. There's also no ability to adjust graphics in-game, this is 2015 Bethesda... come on.  It's very obvious this is a PC port too. Menus are awkward, the cursor lags, there's no field of view options (had to manually adjust it in .INI files), and there is a real lack of customisation for PC. There are also numerous bugs in the game. I often get stuck when accessing terminals and have to reload the game, dogmeat also seems all over the place whilst following you, such as getting stuck behind walls or just getting in the way in general.  I can't say too much else as I'm still playing the game, but overall I'd say it's a good game but nothing worthy of game of the year, Witcher 3 was a million times better than this.

I feel like people who rate that low also hate their favorite bands new albums, because the first album was the best. It's silly. FO4 is not leaps and bounds different than FO3 but I think if they did change it that much there would be another type of backlash. You can never win.  Also comparing this game to The Witcher 3 is weird to me. I see everyone mentioning it. I love The Witcher 3, but the feel is totally different. While fun, The Witcher's greatest asset was the story. The combat was easy mode and the environment was pretty, but you couldn't really interact with anything in it.  I think FO4's improved weapon feel and expansive exploration puts it in a different sort of game from The Witcher. I actually like the exploration and combat more than story some time. I mean, Bethesda's stories have never really been that epic to me, but I hardly play the main quests anyway because the world around me is more fun.  Pros for me:  - The environment is dreary as it should be, but the colors aren't de-saturated like in FO3 - Aiming/weapons feel more responsive and on target - Crafting/modding is fun - Player built houses and settlements are a good option, although it could be improved such as constructing buildings should take time to complete instead of insta-plop. - Looting is simplified, so much quicker, but the option to ""open"" containers is still there - Physical character creation was great - The prologue was short and simple, quicker to get to the real game. - Foliage picking a la TES - Huge open world, tons to explore - You don't have to wait so long for power armor - Power armor is customize-able - Armor acts more like Morrowind's armor system where you can layer items on top of each other and each arm can have different pieces. - Bethesda has said that modding tools will be released.  Cons for me: - Graphics, but this is typical with Bethesda and fixed by the community over time - I am still having a hard time figuring out how to scrap things for resources (I'm not the type to Google things in games, I'm old skool like that) - Not a fan of the Pip-boy UI - The traits menu feels so out of place and is a bit hard to see where your character customization is going - I wish the character creation gave more info as to what each trait helps, such as agility helps small guns for example. Since I'm not a huge FO fan, I didn't really know what did what beyond the super basic description shown - Dialog has been simplified to 4 choices. I'm sure this is done because of the protagonist being voice acted, but I was a huge fan of Morrowind dialog. Way better than FO4 by far.… Expand "

Don't get me wrong, I loved Fallout 3 and NV, and personally think that they both are better games than Fallout 4, but Fallout 4 doesn't fall too behind. Sure this game is riddled with bugs that should've been fixed before it was released, but you should find solace in knowing that Bethesda will be releasing patches in the coming months.  The gameplay is extremely different than 3 and NV. The gun-play has improved a ton, and you don't need to rely as heavily on V.A.T.S. Some might argue that it's dumbed down and is Call of Duty shooting. Personally, in my experience, some if not most of the battles I faced were quite challenging. Aside from the occasional mole rat or boat fly.  As far as the story goes, it's alright. It's not as good as Fallout 3 or NV, but it is indeed better than most game stories out there. I will say though, that the introduction seemed a bit rushed with quite some pacing issues. Once you reach diamond city though, the pacing feels more fluid, although it can still use some work.  Nonetheless, no game is perfect. This game has it's downfalls, mostly in terms of AI and animation. The basic body movements of the character is fine, but the facial expression  has something to be left desired. The lips don't sync with the voice and the face often feels stale. As for AI, they would often times do stupid things and can't aim for **** half of the time.

After that I noticed I found myself facing a moral dilemma; all the factions seemed to dabble in this ""grey area"". It made me question my whole journey so far and the people I had been interacting with. I had this with the previous games too, so it was a nice thing to experience.  Crafting was a nice change and everyone seems to agree on that. I never bothered in New Vegas because it was so tedious and hard to keep track from, unlike in Fallout 4 where you can track mats and the crafting stations have a clear overview.  People say they turned the game into a mindless shooter without rpg elements. I beg to differ. Companions have been reworked into more then an npc that carries your **** for you. They join in conversations, they have different opinions, personal quests that are befitting. They all have unique dialogue lines towards what is happening to you ingame.  People say the quests are boring. The only quests I found boring after a long time were the settlement quests and the dialogue of the settlers. I have to admit those became to tedious for me when I was close to endgame. I ended up not bothering anymore. But aside from that there are many hidden quests that are pretty damn entertaining. Often it starts with finding a holotape or just talking to a random npc. Roam, explore and you will be suprised.  People complain about perks and special beeing destroyed.  It is not gone. It is presented to you in a different manner. I can see why people don't like change, but this is no reason to rate the game badly. I saw many familiar perks and I liked how they handled the collection of books and magazines. Damn it Picket Fences, where you at! Simply because it is not the exact same way as the previous games, doesn't mean it's bad.  Dialogue. Fantastic that our character has a voice now, I loved them both, very fitting and easy to listen to for a long time. But the dialogue wheel was confusing at first. I often found myself trying to ""guess"" what my character was actually going to say. As someone who likes to roleplay this wasn't the best change.  ""Most of the buildings are sealed off"" is simply a lie. There are indeed residential houses that are barred off at the front door, but I found many houses, factories or other buildings I could enter without having a quest to go there. It's like people that claim this only visited Concord (where a lot of them are sealed off) at the start, then quit the game to nag about this.  Technical issues : well it *is* a Bethesda game that has just released. I know, it's absolutely no excuse. I didn't had any gamebreaking bugs (like I heard people say they were unable to advance in main story), but I had my fair share of ctd's, especially when leaving a place, right after it had loaded. Happened like +-10 times during my playthrough. Let's see... the clipping issues at settlemends drove me mad more then once. The carpet trick and tlc commands shouldn't be the best option, they should've just made it better. Period. And lastly eventhough my pc wasn't strong enough op paper (the can I run it website have me red flags for CPU and graphical card), I was able to smootly run it all on medium. I never had lagspikes or stutter.  So what did I miss? I missed the Karma options. Really, really sad they removed it. I don't care about the fact that weapons don't ""break"", but oh the Karma system. I loved that so much. They didn't ""replace"" it too. I guess if you want some sort of indicator of your actions, the like/dislike/admire/hate system of the companions is a filler for it, but then again, not really.  The epilogue, although it brought a little tear to my eye, was missing some elements for me. I was hoping to see an overview of all the damn settlements I had build; or a notion of how I rebuild the Minutemen, or helped the BoS at the end. I loved those crazy endings in the previous games. Alas...  +10 for the radio stations, Travis wasn't a Treedog but it fitted the story. I liked his quest and I liked the tracks he played. The classical music station was an awesome addition, but that is ofc personal taste. I was sad it was gone after my BoS ending, but roleplay wise it made sense.  I guess to conclude my report; most people say it's a copy paste of Fallout 3 with some new dumb down features, but many people say Fallout 3 was superior. I don't get that comparison then. Imo it was yet another different setting in this post apocalypse world, with different factions and their little stories. It felt like a true Fallout game, with hidden easter eggs, crazy encounters, straight up weird people and questlines and a lot more and reworked features. I didn't rate it 10 because of the ctd's, the clipping in settlements and I try not to be an obnoxious fanboy.… Expand "

I do get the sense, that they are starting to shift away from the traditional fallout series, but this is by NO means a bad game.  This game changes up a LOT of stuff from the fallout series, and flips over some other lore on it's head.  Starters, the Power Armor.  Instead of wearing it as an item (as done in the past), it's a suit of armor you step into.  I wasn't sure how I'd like this at first, but I began to enjoy the ""freedom"" this gave, as well as the limit of the fusion cores, to prevent steamrolling the entire game.  Another change, is that VATS is not as important.  Because time doesn't ""freeze"" but instead slows down (which still looks amazing), there's less of a reliance on VATS which has shifted the game into more of a ""shooter"" style than an RPG style, but first person RPGs don't really work out as well.  As far as stealth, I've been using a silenced sniper rifle and crouching and I've had no problems with stealth.  Personally, I think a LOT of the hate towards this game, comes from people upset that they didn't check the specs ahead of time or are upset at the requirements.  Also, I think the hype may have been a part of the problem as well.  The Hype was SO built up, it's not even funny.  Personally, I can't wait to see what obsidian does with the spin-off they are working on.… Expand "

Excellent work, Bethesda. As a casual mainstream console gamer, and loyal diehard fans of Call of Duty, and Ubisoft's user-friendly sandbox action games, I never like Bethesda’s Elder Scroll series or Fallout series, because they lack fantastic action elements, have long dialogue with clunky choices, and are too complicated due to their frustrating attribute and skill system, in which casual gamers don’t know what’s going on in the character level-up mechanism and miss the fantastic gun blazing moments in Call of Duty.  However, from the significant improvement in this title, I can sense the sincere attitude and respect from my newly beloved Bethesda to cater for our taste. This game has improvement because of the following: 1.	Removal of annoying skill system, replaced by easy-to-learn perks 2.	Addition of Call of Duty FPS mechanics, and introduction of bullet time, both are the best features highly praised by casual FPS gamers 3.	Addition of MineCraft base building, another favorite of casual gamers 4.	Introduction of a simplified dialogue wheel system, inspired from one of the master piece from BioWare, Dragon Age II 5.	Power Armor serves as a cool-looking robot / vehicle, every FPS gamers love vehicle! ;) 6.	Best console interface flawlessly ported to PC, even when playing in PC, I can still feel that it is user-friendly, smooth and fantastic which can only be achieved by the perfect harmony of interface from console  Although this game is already the best FPS, as a humble supporter of Bethesda, I would still like to contribute ideas for the upcoming DLC / expansions in future, to further satisfy our gamers’ need: 1.	2-weapon slot only – this is the golden standard of FPS from Call of Duty 2.	Removal of action point system, use kill-streak mechanics to activate bullet time, every FPS fans love this for killing hordes of enemies! ;) 3.	Introduction of cover-based shooting, TPS mode, with frequent switching between FPS and TPS view, and combat / climbing / cover shifting animation playing all the time – think about Deus Ex Human Revolution, every console gamers love to watch the frequent camera switching with combat animation playing on its own! 4.	Removal of weapon mods: please just add the loot-based mechanics from Borderlands, every FPS gamers love to kill enemies / boss for 1000 times or more just to farm the best gear, crafting the best weapon without farming means no fun for FPS fans! ;< 5.	Introduction of online auction house: every casual gamers love this feature, and like to use real-world-money rather than in-game currency to buy rare equipment in an open world of MMO! 6.	Removal of single player mode, enforcement of always-online authentication mechanism and MMO side quests: quest content in single player is still too complex for causal gamers to comprehend, the best solution is to make the game as a MMO, so every quest can be accepted after hearing 1 sentence of quest details from quest giver 7.	Leap of Faith perk, climbing tower to explore map mechanism: the best 2 sandbox feature that has every existed! 8.	Reduce the openness of world: please make the world consist of a large set of linear corridors so that player will never get lost OR just mark all the points of interest on the map just like Ubisoft’s awesome Far Cry series… Expand "

I sank hours into this game. I'd say 90-99% of those were bug free. It's ridiculous to expect a studio Bethesda's size to create anything of this scope with 0 bugs (for any studio it's a long shot). Even then, I enjoyed a few of the bugs and none of them actually stopped me from playing. Most were cured by a quicksave and quickload. Even when I fell through a building (damn you jet pack) I was able to fast travel outside of it and resume. GTA V had much worse bugs. Nearly the whole time I was playing I was having fun, it was Fallout. A little different, sure, but still Fallout and fun is primarily what I look for when I play a game. The graphics were solid, a little dated looking maybe, but they are smooth and do their job. A big improvement on previous Fallouts and Elder Scrolls games (unless you include mods). Whatever, I was never spending time brooding over them anyway, I was off shooting irradiated creatures and collecting bottle caps. The companions. Man, the interaction with them is good, I like that they can disapprove of things you do and throw a strop and leave you, but I feel making them solid was a mistake from a gameplay perspective. I had more fun just wandering the wastes without them because they had a habit of getting in the way, or blowing me up in place of their intended target. A pity, but not a huge issue with the game, I always preferred being a lone wolf and one of the perks specifically boosts your stats when you are companionless. The crafting system was awesome. I had a lot of fun playing with the various upgrades on the different guns, I was a little disappointed the sniper rifles weren't more powerful (my .44 did more damage than a .50 cal) but other than that it was a really nice system. As was the armour upgrades and Power armour upgrades (I really wanted more than one of them on each piece!) The settlement system is a neat idea, horribly implemented. Honestly, this is my biggest gripe with this game, and why it's an 8 and not a 9. It's cool being able to build a settlement, and manage its needs, see it attacked, defend it, populate it, make custom houses, etc. The problem is there's no tutorial for it. There's a tutorial for the combat (which we've seen before) and a short one for the Pipboy, but for the workshop the game just kinda occasionally throws up cryptic pop ups and hopes you figure it out. Once you learn how it all works, how to wire things up (spacebar) and how to wire lights (a powered pylon nearby), you quickly realise that it's incredibly limited and shallow. 6 stories max, no you can't have a balcony, no you can't create a solid wall if there's not precisely enough space for the wall between 2 points, no you can't have anything besides 4 generators and 3 types of pretty much everything else. The worst part of the settlements however is that everything has to be done in person. Want to allocate someone to the defensive tower you built? Well off you go searching through your town to find them then. Want to set up a trade route with another town? Find someone to do it and hope they weren't your farmer or your food production will go down. There's no way to access information on who's doing what and it can take an indefensible amount of time to find who you need to accomplish a task. It's such a faff, I don't think I'll bother with it when I decide to play through the game again. Which is a real pity. The real guts of this game lie in the gameplay. The Bioware-style 4 response system has been criticised, and I can see why people don't like it, but it doesn't really interfere as much as you'd think and I've yet to be surprised by something my character has said. The gunplay is fast-paced and fun, the slowdown for VATS over the old pause mode is a good change, it makes the combat feel more fluid though I think the targeting ui needs a bit of work as it's a pain with a mouse when the targets are near one another. The exploration is truly rewarding with a metric ****-ton of stuff to see and do. The factions are interesting with brilliantly fleshed out backstories and you'll launch the game to ""just do one quest"" and shut it down to find yourself in the small hours of the morning dreading your alarm clock's inevitable squeal in a few short hours.  If someone were to ask me if I recommend buying this game, I'd give them a resounding yes. If they asked me was it a perfect game, it'd be a resounding no. But really, what game is perfect? In the end all that matters is if you can eke out enough fun to justify the money spent on a game, and in Fallout 4s case you don't even need to eke, it supplies it in spades.… Expand "

UI and gameplay: It is very similar to Fallout 3 and New Vegas. I dare say that a heavily New Vegas may come suspiciously close to Fallout 4 in terms of customization even. Other than that - it is almost identical with Pip-boy menu and interacting with the world.  Immersion and story: Hm - this one certainly does not stand out much. The story is clichéd and simplified. I miss the black humor of New Vegas DLCs (yea - only the DLCs .. New Vegas vanilla did not have such a great story either - but even NV vanilla had a better story than FO 4 vanilla)  Difficulty and open world: The AI is better than FO3/NV ... but not by much. The world feels a lot smaller, more cramped than Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 - due to being more detailed in looks - but also because there are more hotspots that spawn stuff.  When you are meant to escort someone through ""the perilous Wasteland to his destination""  - and it turns out that his destination was almost in plain sight all along - it kind of breaks immersion about the ... well.. ""wasteland"" being this open wide arena.  Things i am disappointed with:  Customizing weapons looked like you were able to actually use almost any ""stuff"" you found and try to make it into a weapons part (from how it seemed to be in the early trailer) - but it turns out to be ""just"" a New Vegas style of customization/upgrading. So i cannot use my 10mm pistol grip on a laser rifle that fires through a pipe repeater barrel or so. (yes - i know it makes no sense but still) - So the system is fun and nice, but i had kind of - maybe unjustly - expected more. Also it seems that New Vegas customization - while not offering the same amount of options - had more impact. (truth be told - New Vegas was less modding and more upgrading)  NPCs. Especially New Vegas had a huge amount of interesting NPCs .. from Red Mesa to Old World Blues - and even the vanilla NPCs. Compared to those .... the NPCs i encountered in FO4 are in one word ... boring. They are stereotypes of your ""101 needy quest-giver"" that will send you out on a suicide mission to fetch some useless stuff. While that is kind of the case for most RPGs ... The world of Fallout does not seem to be ""alive"" much. (compared to Skyrim or so) So in terms of a living world - there has not been any advance from Fallout 3.  All in all though - i will spend many hours with that game and i will have fun - so it doesn t make much sense to rate it low.… Expand "

The graphic and gameplay looks exactly the same as the E3 trailer.  Despite all its flaw, Fallout 4 is still easily the best game of this year in my opinion. It is MASSIVE. Each individual areas are not cookie cutter of another area, and they always something unique about it. There are a lot of areas to explore, and the wasteland has never been deadlier than ever.  The biggest complaint is probably the performance issue on the base game. It's hard to do graphic mod, when the base game is having some hard time running at 60fps on GTX 780. Though I don't think the graphic was as bas as other reviewers make it to be. Fallout 3 graphic was considered sub-par even for 2008 standard.  Though I admit the RPG aspect has been dumbed down quite a bit. Most dialogue feels like yes or no and there are not really real consequence of either one of them. I also miss the Karma, faction system, and survival aspect like hunger. I think it's also a mistake to voice the main character. It's harder to feel immersive into the character you created, and voice acting essentially limited all the crazy dialogue you used to be able to say. Also now it's hard for the mod community to create companion mod as they can't voice act the main character interaction with the extra companion.  Also I don't know why they make it so hard to read notes laying on the ground. I have to go to my inventory and specifically locate and read the note I just picked up.  Despite all these flaws, Fallout 4 still come up on top of other games this year. I will probably easily lose 100-200 hours into this game and even more when interesting mods came out.

But 4 hours in and Im loving fallout 4 its all about the stories. Heres mine The Chair………… Wow a post apocalyptic world Like everyone else I hooked up with the minutemen in concord and got my first follower in the form of my faithful hound dogmeat. I then gave them a hand with their settlement Well when I say their settlement I mean it wasn’t like they did anything. I wondered for a while what they ate but it didn’t seem to bother them. I crafted numerous items and I indeed began to get the place quite palatial. I had a sweet rooftop terrace come patio going on. However I was trying to get some sort of garden going so decided to venture further afield in search of seeds. I travelled past concord into the wilderness with my dog beside me dodging huge flies atomic storms and random gunfire. I found myself a neat scarf thing  and some cool goggles. Not a lot of vegetables or fruit or anthing I could use as a seed. However wandering into a disused mall largely sacked of its contents some 200 years after the event. I came across another small group holed up against the raiders. I informed them that I thought the road back to concord was clear. I was invited to join in their counter attack against the raiders I had a shotgun with maybe 10 shells and maybe 50 .38 bullets. However this maybe a chance to stock up a bit on ammo. It started well downing 2 raiders straight off but it turned out i had just  woken them up bullets making a small dust storm on the pillar i had ducked behind. I soon ran low on ammo and I was wondering quite what to do then i saw it just sitting there so to speak. High backed lovely carved legs in a kind of slouched configuration. The chair..... As chance would have it a sudden drive by my comrades left a small window of quiet. I took the chance and grabbed the chair and made for the exit dogmeat following behind me I could hear the gunfire slowly falter. Should i go back and check who the victor was... Instead I headed back across the wasteland clutching the chair (it would look lovely on the patio). In order to move the chair i couldnt shoot or defend myself so this involved alot of moving it putting it down shooting bloat flies or ordering my faithfull mutt dogmeat too get em. However this slow progress meant spending long nights in what ever shelter i could find. By day 5 it was dragging a bit driven indoors due to a severe atomic storm i waited hours sat looking at the sky only 2 miles from base just a short hop over that ridge over there. It looked like it was clearing and there was only 2 hours daylight left. I was determined i would not spend another night in some hovel the patio set was calling. A quick whistle to round up dogmeat i grabbed the chair and set off for the ridge trying to avoid the main road for fear of bands of raiders. I chose the gentlest route mindful of getting the chair through the undergrowth. But then charging out it appeared huge and angry. With only 7 bullets left this demanded quick thinking using vats i dived slamming all 7 .38 shells into the monsters left leg. I ordered  dogmeat to outflank the creature then ordering him to make back for concorde through the small copse near the rat infested pool we had passed a few moments before. With a furious roar and a slight limp  the creature bore down on dogmeat. I turned quickly grabbed the chair and then legged it.

Not huge character building like Skyrim, but a slimmed down perk based system. Creating/crafting settlements is a great new feature that I'm really enjoying. It finally makes picking up all that junk in the wasteland worth it!  Overall I feel if you liked Fallout3/NV, this is a good continuation set in Boston with slightly modified leveling system and a ""slow motion"" VATS targeting system. AI, voice acting, linear main quest, are all very similar. I'm having fun and enjoying the game so far.  And like Skyrim, Fallout3/NV, I can't wait to start loading some mods!… Expand "

Anyway, ill start with:  The Bad. - The dialogue is terrible compared to FO3 and tying into this the karma system as well. It was awesome all the different dialogue options they had and I dont think they needed to ""optimize"" this aspect for console. I played FO3 on the 360 and it was just as easy in terms of dialogue...pretty pissed about this  - I guess the graphics aren't very good, but I don't really give a **** to be honest. The people whining about that are just dickheads. Awesome graphics are something I appreciate when I first step into a gameworld and then forget about.  The good: - Tons of fun to fight, gunplay is way better and the VATS is still awesome and slightly improved by the crit meter  - Looting system is way better and helps to keep the game immersive  - Quests are quite fun, people saying they're all fetch quests must have played like 2 hours and went looking for fetch quests. A quest to rescue someone /= a fetch quest. A lot of the quests revolve around going and clearing places out which means killing. This is like half the point of this game, killing everything...Anyway, I'd say the quests are on par with FO3.  - Crafting and modding system, awesome, simply put. House building...pretty fun, never played the mod everyone talks about but I enjoy this aspect for maybe 30 minutes at a time then I get bored, move on and come back later.  - New enemies, holy **** so much fun. Legendary enemies were a great edition. Also the degrees of enemies is awesome, like ranks and whatnot.  - Power armor is way better in this game, finding really good power armor seems pretty hard to do (good) so you work for it. Also new guns that are awesome, junk jet is okay, syringer is pretty cool, but the variety of weapons is just awesome.  - tons of new songs and things to listen to on the radio, ****s my jam, that fiddle is awesome.  - Weird little side quests that show up are cool so far, my guess is that they'll get boring but so far they're fun.  I think I've touched upon everything I wanted to. For reference, I'm about 50 hours into the game at present. I've tried to be as critical as possible, I'd realistically rank this at an 8.5/10 if they let me but i settled on 9 because I think the game is just tons of fun.… Expand "

I may be new to this site but usually when a game is slightly disappointing or doesnt do exactly what i want i don't say **** it and give it a three two one or zero. This game is very far from perfect i will freely admit, my biggest complaints by far are the dialogue system which lists options that do a piss poor job at telling me what the heck my character is going to say (seriously, all they write for some of my favorite AND least favorite lines is ""sarcastic"") and the fact that i can't see my damn gun on my back! i mean for ****'s sake who thought to leave that out? It's like half of our character aesthetics. Also yes. graphics could be better. It's true, Get over it, and actually play the damn game. ALSO GLITCHES: I've made it through morrowind, oblivion, skyrim, fallout 3, (not fallout new vegas sorry) with almost no problems but my fallout 4 wants to crash sometimes. Also your companions are dance masters which they choose to do instead of walking half the time. also the minutemen are boring... very boring. I'd imagine half the people who thought the story was terrible played the minutemen...  THE GOOD: HOWEVER! I have gotten more good times, laughs and adrenaline highs from this game than every other game I'VE PLAYED (DA inquisition, star wars battle front, black ops 3, blood borne, every piece of destiny to say a few) thats come out in the past two years. All of which have much batter graphics. Now before you turn off you're computer in disgust let me explain. I can't seem to group fallout 4 next to any of those because the game is different than just about any title that's come out. It's clunky and glitchy but you can pick up anything in the entire world, talk to hundreds of colorful NPCs all of which operate on their own schedules. It's about the closest thing to a living breathing world in all of gaming. In terms of innovation the crafting (which you may EXTENSIVELY do on weapons, armor, power armor, and settlements-settlements can be very clunky at times though-) is the largest, most expansive and generally most pleasing to use system in any game to date. And now these weapons all look and feel great to use. The combat has been improved greatly as well, as a result you will so bigger and more epic fights just about everywhere you go, especially into the campaign. Speaking of the campaign, while not the best in any fallout game it is far from the worst and offers some potentially emotional moments while giving you a substantial platform to go off into the world. The endings are unfortunately lackluster though. The real star of this game is the world which is BY FAR the most detailed, overwhelming and expansive one of all the fallouts and indeed any bethesda has made. It is colorful, positive at times, and if you play in it for more than an hour vastly different than fallout 3. The factions are also much more active than in fallout 3 or new vegas (read they actually do stuff) Your faction that you choose will really exist in the common wealth and will fight beside you randomly or when called (all of the factions allow for this). .Companions are extremely glitchy and that could be in the bad but they are strangely charming and hilarious at times. AND THE LOOT IS AMAZING. because of the crafting system allowing for so many possibilities the loot is also extremely varied as are the enemies that drop it. It never gets old hunting legendary enemies one for their loot and two to prove how much more legendary i the player am. Power armor also feels like power armor. It's more like a walking tank instead of just some more **** clothes like in fo3 or foNV. This results in the brotherhood truly being monsters to take down!. All of this plus the fact that I've spent over 50 hours and have seen maybe a third of the map and actually explored so much less than that. There are still guns i haven't seen and TONS of enemies i haven't fought. I've literally only broken the surface of fallout 4 and all i want is more.  THE VERDICT: Fallout 4 a clunky glitchy game with very clear weaknesses that are easy to point out and get caught up on. But it is also a massive world with a ridiculous amount of things to do and places to explore. No other game on the market can even touch that, the closest probably being the witcher 3 but fallout 4 is much more detailed. If you liked fallout 3 buy it. if you liked skyrim and want to see what would happen in you dropped a few nukes on a bethesda game, buy it. If you are a classic fan and think vegas is that much better than three because reasons this game is not what you're looking for. If you want a seamless gaming experience and have no patience for anything less than a baby's ass in terms of smooth gameplay this game will piss you the hell off.  t's different… Expand "

If you did not notice the review was satirical in nature in response to what I feel is a complete overblown reaction to Fallout 4's Release. I am by no means a fanboy and I to have found quite a few flaws with the game, however I do not think it is justifiable to give it a 0/10 based off some of the ridiculous points I outlined above which I have read in the Metacritic reviews panning this game and giving it 0's.  Overall Fallout 4 itself would fall around an 8 for me, and yes I have played previous Fallout Games (Fallout 1, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas).  Pros Include: + Great new gun play, a lot more enjoyable with added Iron Sights for all weapons. + A nice art design. + The Settlement building is a nice new addition. + The world is quite dynamic with a lot of unique locations. + Fully voiced main character is quite an accomplishment considering the sheer amount of scripted responses. + Great new crafting. + A vast amount of content.  Drawbacks: - Leveling skills are gone (Yes I am with people on this, I don't quite understand why Bethesda did it). - If you've got an AMD card prepare for some stuttering. - Weird new looting mechanic which I found a bit odd. - The worst radio announcer ever (or maybe I just don't like his humor). - Some character models are pretty bad.  It's a good game, if you are someone who is able to play a game without getting upset by the fact that its not got everything from previous installments. If you are a die hard Fallout fan then I would understand maybe a 3 or 4, but a 0 is just a sad attempt to reduce the overall user score and Fallout 4 does deserve a bit better.… Expand "

Its not setting a new standard for sure, but it is satisfactory and my 970 handles the game pretty well except for one or two locations that have stuttered a bit.  Gameplay is great.  Bullets actually go where you are aiming instead of sometimes going off on a tangent because of your skill.  I prefer the new VATs system slow mo, stealth seems more viable than in previous Fallouts (it feels like Skyrim, you can even take people out with guns from a good location without being instantly detected).  Your pip boy can be used as a flashlight, sprinting is a welcomed feature, preserving your power armor fusion cores is a nice mechanic, and exploring is fun as always.  The bad: early bugs typical of every Bethesda game, NPCs getting annoying in doorways.  I won't dock the game any points for those, since those have also been issues in every other Bethesda game I loved, but its disappointing it wasn't improved on.  The areas where I feel like the game really regressed is the 4 choice dialogue and no faction reputation system.  People like or dislike you on an individual basis, which isn't very well explained how that works.  IMO everyone except for maybe a half dozen super characters should be killable, and it seems like this game doesn't let you RP the evil guy as much as before.  Another problem is the settlements aren't very well explained.  I have built up sanctuary a bit so that I can have a good place to stow my gear and have some merchants there, but the game doesn't try to tell you why it is important to maintain the other settlements.… Expand "

When I finally realized how the pieces fit together I was exstatic, like I was blind and then could see. The right music was on and i was thought, ""OH MY GOD"" as I started hoovering up every item I could.  It stays true to previous tropes in that it's an inticing wander-land. I see places on the horizon, holes, interesting markers, and find things where nothing should be. It scratches that itch!  A complaint I have is the RPG aspect - I can accept not having some of the basic RPG tropes, especially those common to the fallout franchise; games evolve, and it doesn't detract from the game. No longer do you have weapon skills which level up, nor do weapons seem to degrade, it's really nice not having to think about those things.  Relatedly, the dialog options make the game feel on-rails. LIke, I meet some new people and I don't want to give them my back story because what if they're the bad guys, my character doesn't know -- so I have three options ""tell them about my son"" ""tell them I'm a vault dweller"" ""Feel sorry for them"" and so I choose 'feel sorry for them' and my character says something like ""I lost my son, i feel sorry for you"". but I'll just ride it out.  I find it astonishing that there are so many low reviews on here; reading the reddit comments about the game prior to release I was expecting a crap fest but I can't put the game down or get it out of my head. I think it was the most played game in Steam's history last night.  Maybe people think they're being edgy by hating on it? I just don't get it.  If you like video games. If you like fallout.

Speaking of settlements, this part of the game is fantastic. It's like another game in and of itself, you manage them, defend them, and can build them up to small cities. The story is way better than 3, too early to say if it matches New Vegas. The dialogue system works just fine, though I wouldn't mind a UI mod to improve that aspect for PC. The progression system is a massive improvement, I was worried about it at first but having so many perks and one each level makes your decisions matter a lot while also not feeling major regret over a perk choice. Power armor is freaking AMAZING and balanced by having to have fusion cores. Weapon and armor customization is fantastic, your gun feels unique. There are also new base types of weapon, such as the laser musket, that add a lot to the game. Legendary enemies are challenging with a good loot payoff. Almost everything gives you experience, so you can do whatever mix of combat, building, and crafting that you want and still progress.  I don't have many complaints, certainly not enough to drop this review to a 9. The UI for PC could be better, especially for dialogue and settlements. There are a few bugs, nothing game breaking for me, though I have a friend with a 144 hz monitor who had to drop the framerate because the game breaks after 60 fps.

This is the problem with instant reviews, nobody has really had time to make a safe assessment on how they feel about the game. Please consider what I have said here if you do not currently enjoy the game and give it some time, I'm sure a lot of you will change your minds.… Expand "
Grim_Morn,"Nov 14, 2015",5," Feels bad. Main storyline pretty much suck. There are just a few sude-story quests, that may be considered interesting. Gameplay mechanics were made very casual and oversimplistic. Dialog options, perks, etc... all suck. DLC , well , you've already guessed it, it suck as well. Even Far Harbor. Wasted time and money. Much better with mods, but ,hey, everything is better with mods "
Micalica,"Dec  1, 2015",8," A lot of people will give this game a bad review without playing it, just like every Call of Duty game.  It's a good game. Not fantastic, not amazing, not perfect, not the amazing sequel we wanted. But at the very least, it's a good game. "

It has more complexity than the New Vegas landscape and reminds me more of GTAV and I cant wait to explore all of it. Within the buildings and the various 'dungeons' there are some finely crafted adventures to be had. I can understand some peoples criticism of the minecraft, base building elements but I feel it just drew me in to the story a bit more. Graphics wise I am playing mostly on Ultra with a few settings notched down to ensure smooth gameplay, particularly the godrays which seem to kill my system.

TrantaLocked,"Nov 22, 2015",9," Fallout 4 is much better than I expected. My favorite things about it are the open world exploration, Diamond City radio host, V.A.T.S, terminals, modding, town management and the really cool economy system.

These materials are used for moddingFallout 4 is much better than I expected. My favorite things about it are the open world exploration, Diamond City radio host, V.A.T.S, terminals, modding, town management and the really cool economy system. With the new economy system, literally every supposed ""useless"" item you can pickup can be used for base materials like steel and plastic. These materials are used for modding weapons/armor and building structures, utilities and furniture in the towns you are allied with. Basically, you need these materials, which makes it feel even better picking up every single thing you find. Fallout 4 makes you feel productive with this system.  There is a nEaT feature called tagging which let's you highlight specific materials so that when scavenging you will see a magnifying glass hover over objects that contain the tagged materials. This is useful if you are looking for rare materials and want to make sure you don't skip over objects containing those materials.  I also want to comment specifically on the whole build and manage your own settlements thing. It's really fun. You build utilities to provide useful functions to your settlement (pumping water from the river, siren in case of emergency), manage workers to farm and defend the land, make furniture like chairs and beds, build new houses, and a bunch of other random stuff.  People have been complaining about the UI, and it was a shock to me. Before I had read any of the reviews I was remarking to myself on just how intuitive the Pip Boy UI was. It certainly destroys what was in Skyrim. I mean if people are complaining that the UI is bad in Fallout 4, then Skyrim's UI must be literally hitler. It was just atrocious; it made me not want to even use it. But the Fallout 4 Pip-boy is really easy to use and makes things go smoothly. It's also cool as fvck. I love the clicking noises in the Pip Boy and computer terminals. The sound guys knew what was up during development it seems.  The exploration is fun and relaxing. There are random encounters that just make you smile or intrigued. The gunplay is surprisingly intense. And I like the graphics. They may not be literally the best, but there is something about the Bethesda style that has grown on me, so you can owe that to nostalgia I guess. Therefore you could say I'm happy they didn't completely upgrade the graphics or engine and animations. Having those remnants from previous Bethesda games makes my nostalgia happen. Just thinking about the game in general, that Diamond City Radio host sort of seems like god. Like, with all I'm doing in the game, his station is the meaning of life or something like that. It's like Fallout 4 is the matrix and he is the architect.  Game performance is decent. I can maintain 60 FPS at around medium/high settings 1080p on an HD 7850 2GB (oc'd) and i5-4690. Some settings I'd love to keep on but can't, like screen space reflections and ambient occlusion. Great effects but also huge FPS drains.  FvCk tHe HaTeRs. Fallout 4 is actually an amazing game if you take the time to explore all of what it has to offer.… Expand "

Neutral : / Minor bugs - Stuck in a tree? Or in a rock? / Building Settlements (Neutral) - Very enjoyable at first, then annoying as hell. / Critical Strikes - They are not random anymore. I, personally, don't use V.A.T.S. so, it is kinda useless for me.  Bad : - Slow rendering - This happened me and some of my friends. Graphics don't load fast enough. Sometimes i only see plain, untextured objects. - Minor optimization problems - Random FPS drops, this happens rarely, but can be annoying. - Game crashing bugs - Only encountered 3-4 bugs like this. They will fix it, probably. - Very few weapon/armor models - I kinda annoyed by the number of weapon/armor models. They are all customizable but you cannot change some parts. - Dialogue - You will have 4 choices in every dialogue. That limits the RPG immersion unlike the old Fallouts games. - Story (Bad) - The main story seems rushed a bit. And it has the worst prologue in the Fallout series. - Lack of major factions - There are a few major factions. Even less than Fallout 3.  Conclusion : Do not be scared by the bugs, bad reviews and cons. Game is incredibly beautiful and fun to play.

AThis game is utterly amazing.  The crafting system alone allows for infinite amount of immersive looting bliss, and endless customization possibilities.  The perk system, while digressing from the classic format of the previous games, has it's own unique advantages to offer, and really allows the user to form a better strategy about which perks to choose to shape their gameplay style.  A few other high points of the game:  - The low graphics setting of the game still offers better shadows, lighting, fade, and textures than either FO3 or New Vegas. Or Skyrim, for that matter.  There's also weather now!  And plus, people, I'm running this game on my 5-year old Dell XPS laptop.  If I can run it, so can you.  - The armor system is now very innovative, allowing for increased versatility through mods and piece-by-piece customization and upgrades.  Yeah, you get Power Armor right away, but it's no longer OP, and also finally gets the respect it deserves in terms of work required to upgrade it, in my opinion.  - The guns are now more balanced and handle in a more realistic fashion.  The non-VATS use of guns has always been mildly disappointing in previous installments, but Fallout 4 makes it more fun to run and gun and not sacrifice your FPS self-respect.  And did I mention that there's a crafting system actually worth using in this game?  Works for weapons too, by the way.  - The story.  To be frank, who really cares about the main story?  It's an open world RPG (yes, it is still an RPG, haters), so you can make your own.  Besides, it's not bad in it's own right anyway.  Sure, New Vegas probably has the edge in terms of plot, and the dialogue wheel is a bit disappointing.  But hey, that's why Steam exists, to be able to go back and revel in the nostalgia of earlier releases.  Also, Bethesda has never been the shining standard for fantastic voice-acting.  So that's it then, folks. A terrific entry in the Fallout canon. Sure, The Witcher 3 is better.  But that doesn't make this one bad. Fallout 4 isn't the best game ever, but it also isn't the abhorrent piece of garbage that many reviewers will try to make you think it is.  Because trolls....trolls never change.

Lilmanike,"Nov 11, 2015",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          This is definitely going to be game of the year with a large open world, a large variety of perks, weapons, armor, and so much more.  A Dead Land: The game excels when it comes to its open world. Lots of enemies, new ways explore the world, and it's been reported that Fallout 4's map size is 11 minutes long vertically. And trust me it's large. The game looks gorgeous with a new creation engine. Some people say it isn't graphically up to date but you have to admit, it is a giant leap from Fallout New Vegas (2010). You guys also realize that map size is a factor, right? Plus with lots of new radio stations and lots of side quests in which other companions could possibly react towards the actions of these side missions and some may interest you. You can also create your own settlement that you have to keep resourced, defended, and a simple place to let settlers rest and go on with their business.  200-Life Crysis: The game takes place a few minutes or hours ""depending how long you create your character"" before the bombs have dropped. So you soon enter Vault 111 where a freak experiment goes horribly wrong. Since your 200 year cryogenic stasis, takes you deep into the future in where you have to find your son Shaun who has been kidnapped by the institute a isis like group who kidnaps survivors of the commonwealth. So it is your job to take him back.  Guns n' more bullets: Shooting is more playable. V.A.T.S. is still a thing in this Fallout installment but shooting a gun feels more shooty than your average Fallout game. Your guns no longer break so you can shoot with letting it break but it looses a more survival focused aspect but I didn't like survival focused aspects anyway. You can also customize your amazing little guy into a F***ing beast, with re-naming it, adding new weapon mods that are available to all weapons. Legendary enemies drop legendary loot and it is either amazing or surprising. You can also choose when you want to get a critical strike on an enemy or not. It you get enough hits on enemies, you will build up a bar that will fill up and create an execution command and vats no longer pause the game it will slow it down the game leaving vulnerable to an easy but cheap death, so act fast.  The Uglies returned: Enemies look more disgusting and more terrifying than ever before. With new ones such as bloodbugs and synths. Oh and if you hate deathclaws they're back and deadlier than ever. Enemies with a star next to them represent Legendary enemies. Enemies featured with a skull next to them, f***ing run. You can guess who is the first is to encounter.  Packin' a punch: The amount of base perks built in to the game are over 70 but go a little deeper and you will find over 200 perks. How, they are counted a mini perks to a perk. Let that sync in to your head before moving on. Bobbleheads make a return but a little more impactful than Fallout 3.

It is a f-king fantastic game with attention to detail everywhere and so much content to explore. The game mechanic is great and blends so well with the environment. I was never a true fan of any shooter game but this game just make it work for me. Some may claim its shallow, but if you pay enough attention to detail, it is actually way beyond what meets the eye. The only complaint I have for this game is the Railway Faction. Why the hell would you want to save synth when humanity is on the brink of destruction?

Fancypenguin,"Dec  3, 2015",6," Fallout 4 is by no means a bad game. As an open world sandbox F/TPS, it's quite fun and solid. If this was  a new IP i'd be thrilled.  But there's one problem, and it's that it has the Fallout name attached to it. For those who aren't old enough to remember, Fallout 1 and 2 defined the isometric RPG genre in the late 90's.

But there's one problem, and it's that it has the Fallout name attached to it. For those who aren't old enough to remember, Fallout 1 and 2 defined the isometric RPG genre in the late 90's. Fallout 4 is barely an RPG, and Bethesda doesn't make enough significant improvements in their sophomore effort with the franchise to warrant the stripped down RPG elements.  Fallout 4 is a game that is stuck in last gen, and I'm not just talking about the graphics.  Let's get this out of the way right off the bat,  because I don't want to keep harping on something that's rather insignificant: yes the graphics are terrible. The textures are muddy and low resolution, the character models look like half melted action figures and the animations are overall just poor.  The artstyle is actually pretty nice compared to 3's general puke aesthetic, but it doesn't make up for the lack of good textures or animations.  Another thing i'd like to get out of the way: Yes there are bugs and performance issues...A lot of them.  If Ubisoft had released this game, gamers would be rioting for their executive's heads on a pitchfork.  I've not experienced many FPS issues in my 30+ hours of playtime, but I've had multiple game breaking bugs and crashes.  Fallout 4's biggest offense is one that is the cardinal sin in all of gaming. It's boring.  Boring quests, boring characters, boring dialogue, boring story and for the most part boring world.  In a year where CD Projekt Red gave us Witcher 3 and Obsidian gave us Pillars of Eternity, RPGs with characters, story, quests and a world worth getting invested in, Fallout 4 falls incredibly flat in comparison.  Having a metric F**k ton of throwaway, shovelware quests is what RPGs from 2010 do.  A studio with the prestige and resources that Bethesda has should be held to a higher standard than this.  Fallout 4's second biggest offense is that it strips away almost all of the Role Playing elements in favor of streamlined features.  Now I'm not saying that there has to be complexity for complexity's sake, and I'm all for streamlining of certain features, but this game strips away almost all pretenses of it being an RPG.  The perks are oversimplified and skills hardly matter as the game takes a Skyrim approach and your character ends up being a Jack of all trades no matter what.  I'm sorry, but if your RPG doesn't allow the player to effectively choose how they want to create their character, it's hard to get invested in said character, then your game has utterly failed as an RPG. A big part of this is the voiced protagonist and the stupid Mass Effect lite dialogue system.  While the actual voice actors for the protagonist (And most other characters in general) are great, it goes a long way to adding to the feeling that you're playing as a Bethesda created character (O.C. do not steal) instead of the character you want to create.  I know people are critical of silent protagonists, but I think the Bethesda game formula works best when you are allowed full control of your character (Including whether you want to be a genuine saint or a sarcastic prick) The lack of perk specific dialogue hurts too (Think Lady killer/Black Widower in New Vegas)  It also doesn't help that the dialogue is dreadfully boring and seems like it was written by somebody who watched The Book of Eli on repeat while on an ambien bender.  Fallout 4 does offer some improvements though.  The gunplay is vastly improved over the other 3d Fallouts. VATS now slows down time instead of pausing the game which I liked, and the settlement building is pretty fun, albeit a little tacked on and clunky.  The new crafting system is awesome as well, allowing for you to actually make unique items out of the junk you find in the wasteland.  This is one of the few times where it feels like the world of the Fallout 4 is working with the game mechanics, and it makes you feel invested in searching every crevice of the world, although the UI for gathering loot constantly popping up does hurt the immersion factor some.  Ultimately though, it's hard to shake the feeling that this is just Fallout 3 in Boston.  The improvements are marginal at best, and don't make up for the over simplified features, dated graphics, lack of feeling invested in a character YOU created and quests, characters, story and dialogue that are  about as interesting as watching paint dry on growing grass.  Bethesda refused to learn from their mistakes with 3 while also seemingly forgetting everything that Obsidian's New Vegas did right. If you're looking for a solid sandbox shooter to mess around with , it's quite fun, but if you're expecting a good RPG out of what was once a genre defining franchise, you'll be sorely disappointed.… Expand "

I simply adore that setting. When Fallout 4 released, I was naturally happy but also sceptical, since 3 is the least favorite of the games, and after seeing what a good job Obsidian had done in New Vegas, I had to be realistic in my expectations on what Bethesda would do. I played this game with very, very low expectations and apparently it turned out well for my experience. I was not as disappointed as many other people, but I still expected to see more.  In short, Fallout 4's roleplaying elements are the fewest I've seen in the franchise. Your character's background is pretty much established, while the previous protagonists have been more or less blank slates. In Fallout 4, not only do they talk, but their dialogue options are severely limited. This is probably the biggest sin in my opinion. I want to roleplay as whoever I want, a dumb good natured baseball bat-swinging ninja or a malicious post-apocalyptic wooer of people. In Fallout 4 all I can be is a bit sarcastic. That's not player freedom exactly. I simply do not understand the dialogue wheel at all. I never liked it, and never will, especially not in games that I want to have total roleplay freedom. Here's hoping that this dialogue system gets forgotten real soon. I was also disappointed with the lack of a Hardcore mode like the one in New Vegas. But I'm 100% certain that a mod will include something closely resembling it, so I'm not taking it into account for this review (even though I should)  Moving on from roleplay to the actual gameplay: That one is the strong point in the game. I liked the gunplay, and the use of the covers. In survival difficulty unfortunately is quite artificial. The enemies are tougher and shoot harder, and healing is nerfed. What I was hoping was high lethality for both sides; you AND the enemies could kill each other with a couple of bullets. Here's hoping that another mod fixes that issue. The settlement building needs a few tweaks in the hotkeys and placement, but it's a fun feature. I liked the perks and haven't noticed the absence of skills that much. Although finding ways to amplify the damage of your weapons is quite difficult, having to rely on magazine and the SPECIAL more than ever before.  It is quite apparent that Bethesda has borrowed lots of ideas from players mods. The slow time effect some perks have, the way stimpaks heal the settlement building and others have existed in the past as mod projects. It is without doubt that they have been lazy when it came to Fallout 4, and I'm left a bit disappointed. It could have been so much better.  Still, I don't think it deserves the scorn it has suffered from the more bitter fans. This game is a solid, and I mean SOLID 7/10. Performance-wise it's exceptionally good and I have not crashed to desktop a single time (I'm using a r9 270x).I should add at this point that it feels a bit weird, having to thank a game for not crashing on me.  Now as far as the story and setting goes, my personal opinion is that I find the Commonwealth quite lovely. I never imagined a morbid wasteland when it came to Boston anyway. The story is as good as you'd expect from a game with dialogue wheels and limited choices. This and the lack of roleplaying freedom cost the game 2 point from me. The other point was removed thanks to limitations in gameplay and apparent console port leftovers.  It is still 7 as in 'quite above average, but with distinct flaws that keep it from becoming a GOOD game'… Expand "

I'm going to address some of those points here. Oblivion is to Fallout 3 as Skyrim is to Fallout 4.  There is no hand holding in this game. You need to immerse yourself in it to figure it out. Which I love.  No Skill System: I find this untrue. Any level up grants you points to either pick a perk or put a point into your special. This being said, unlike past fallout games you can't put 10 points into intelligence and be a master of everything. There is no perk that allows you two skill points on level up instead of one. This doesn't so much bother me because the character customization is so much more dynamic because of it. It forces you to strategically allocate your points so that you character specializes in certain things. You can't be a master of all weapons, lock picking, crafting, charisma, and be able to carry as much as you want. This is very similar to the way the skill system in Skyrim is. I love it, it makes the game more challenging and every time I play I can have a different experience.  There aren't enough random quests: I've read this complaint a ton and I have found it to be completely false. I've been playing this game pretty consistently since it's release and have yet to begin the main story line past the initial quest. That being said, random quests don't fall into your lap as easily. As is characteristic of Bethesda you have to talk to people, but there are also tons of quests that aren't marked on the map or initiated in towns. You have to go find them. This means if you fast travel everywhere you won't. There are hidden locations and quests all over the world.  Not enough dialogue options: This is semi true. You only have four options for dialogue when speaking to someone. But it also gives you random options sometimes depending on your skills. Also, if you don't pick certain options you can miss out on items and quests.  Bugs: Yes there are bugs, sometimes you have to initiate a conversation more than once to get it started. Small complaint but annoying. The game also just released so I'm sure there will be a patch in the future. Companions pick up random items and then can't carry the ones you hand them because they are overburdened. It's still an awesome way to get free stuff. The build mode can be buggy but this is usually resolved by exiting and trying again.  Bad graphics: Um no, the graphics are awesome. I'm on the PS4 and I was impressed. If I had an alienware I would probably be blown away.  I love that you don't have to open something to see what is inside it or loot it this would save me time if I didn't find myself opening my pip boy often when I'm trying to close the loot menu, which you don't have to do. This will be resolved when I reprogram my brain to not hit O when I'm done looting.  Overall I am loving this game, it is more difficult, there are more options, and I feel as though this will entertain me for years to come just like Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, and Fallout NV have. At least until Bathesda releases another elder scrolls game, which could be years at this rate and then I'll have to allocate my time equally between the two.  Great game. Hours upon hours of entertainment. Worth the money.… Expand "

Everything looks infinitely better than FONV.  Environments are more alive and less depressing.  Again, developers listened to the modding community and implemented their own rad storms and left out the green filter.  People have commented on lack of detail.  I noted on starting the game for the first time yesterday that textures in the vault seemed a bit washed.  Some textures even seemed outright wrong like a leather texture which glistened like lip gloss.  Apart from the vault textures and the glossy leather I experienced once, everything is a lot better looking and I think it's because this time they didn't slap rust on EVERY SINGLE INCH OF EVERY SINGLE THING.  That effect got old quickly in FONV.  2.)  Voiced main character:  Big mistake but you know what?  It's not a canned, hipster-tidal-wave-of-diarrhea voice a la Far Cry 4 so I'm not all that bothered.  It's only odd when the dialogue gets corny - mainly during ""Family Time"" which is any time he's talking to his wife or about his son.  3.)  Actual Power Armour (finally!):  You're not jumping into this and playing the rest of the game with it on.  You need to keep it powered up and the fusion batteries you need are around but rare enough that the suit won't spoil the game.  The power armour hud is glorious.  The suit feels (and sounds!!) fantastic.  Heavy and it's upgradable with science and certain crafting materials.  I also enjoy the way you step in and out of it.  4.)  Speaking of science:  what the hell happened??  The skills/perks system is a MESS.  I have NO IDEA what the hell is going on and I don't even know how to increase science.  This aspect of the game is aggravating.  5.)  People have complained about character animations.  With regard to the NPCs, their facial animations while talking are actually interesting.  I like the new style.  The animation for the running power armour is a joke.  lol  What's all that about?  6.) RPG elements:  I don't understand how 4 differs in this regard from NV apart from being better.  A lot of the things people lament having been removed are things I think the game is better off without.  ""There are fewer dialogue options!""  Really?  Seriously -  I see FO4 as leaner and meaner in the sense that it does away with a lot of superfluous crap from the previous releases and instead focuses on more enjoyable details.  It also gets to the point.  This world felt so much more real to me.  And I'm not taking anything away from NV which was great but this is definitely an improvement and easily the liveliest of the three worlds.  One of the things I hated about 3 and NV was how dead the worlds felt despite the fact that they were teeming with life.  I think 4 got the global atmosphere right, this time.  Also technology.

Having never been much of a Fallout 3 - lover myself (the story just never hooked me, and I never felt very guided), I was very pleasently surprised with Fallout 4. Almost every aspect that made me put down FO3 early, has improved - the mediocre dramaturgy, the ""static"" combat, thestiffly-written dialogues, and, as mentioned, the quickly feeling lost in this sandbox universe - It was still a great game, though. FO4 changes all that - the combat is a lot more intuitive, the dialogues are funny and, due to the voice acting, draw you in quickly, and the quests offer a sense of guidance. From a gamer's point of view, the graphics might not be able to compare with an AC, but given the Open-World character of the game, with very little loading areas, they look stunning and, most importantly, crafted with love.

My review is my honest assessment , thus = A REVIEW.

I also disagree with this tendency of rating things 0 / 10 because you want to affect the overall score.  That's not what a review is --- you are doing it wrong.  My review is my honest assessment , thus = A REVIEW.  First, responding to many of the criticisms:  "" lets take all context away from the choices the player will make"" ""No choice on how to develop your character"" ""No character development""  What was the ""character development"" in Fallout 3?  Oh right, you could either blow up Megaton, or not blow up Megaton.  You had that ridiculous karma system (I stole 5 items, but I want to stay as a ""saint"".. so I just have to kill 10 creatures to make the karma back...)   People apparently have some strange rose colored glasses looking at the past.   No game EVER has had a very good karma system, and I'm talking this problem goes all the way back to the first games that tried it like Ultima 4.   It's not an easy thing to do.  Fallout 3 was a fake 'which way' book that only had 2 endings,  the plot was entirely linear with little variation based on your actions.  That's true of every RPG game that attempts it.  On that note, I'd say this version of Fallout tried a little less than those games to make you PRETEND your choices have an effect.  I'll give you, blowing up megaton is a pretty major change to the game / storyline - but that was the only major change.  In this version there's actually quite a few directions your character can go as far as following specific quest lines - but the outcome is going to end up the same in the end --- and it did in fallout 3 and New Vegas and as I said EVERY RPG I can think of.  I'll give you that the good guy / bad guy aspect is slightly diminished in this version (such as not killing off the whole town.. something I personally haven't found to be thrilling since I was 13.. but ok, true) but all the criticisms leveled above in quotes could also have gone for Fallout 3 or any RPG.  As far as the criticisms about the perk system / skills.  Funny that everyone flips out, they condensed all of the same skills that Fallout 3 had in the form of a percentage score, and instead turned them into perks.  Smart move, in my opinion - they just consolidated it into one.  Example -- you may before have had lockpicking that went from 0 to 100% -- now you have 5 ranks.  The old lockpicking skill that was a percentage was STILL actually just 5 levels of lockpicking disquised as a 0 to 100%... the effect of that was, you could have a score of say 70 and be short of making the next level...  it was in other words, rather broken.  But now, they changed it to a perk system, and fallout fans think they lost something.  All the skills you had, big guns, commando, etc - they are almost all represented in the same way as before - even with the same names in many cases - but instead of a skill - it's a perk.  It's not that confusing people... it's the same - actually they've just added a lot of skills / perks you didn't have before -- bonus.  Other criticisms  ""That silly wheel with only 4 choices""  ... I honestly don't understand you people.  Again, how many choices in dialog did you have with fallout 3?  Do you guys have some false memory where you typed in your responses to the dialog or something?   It's the same, except the dialog gives a summary of what you are saying rather than word for word - I prefer the short version.  Criticism made ""It's more of a shooter than an RPG""  Fallout 3 was a first person shooter - and not any different really, except they've improved the shooting - and now VATS  doesn't pause completely  (also an improvement in my view, you shouldn't be able to pause indefinitely in the middle of a fight while targeting, but... hey, it's a targeting system - so maybe.  Whatever the case, I like that it continues to move in slo-mo, I think it's a nice touch.)  You know, there's a lot of different criticisms, and I think most are about some romanticized version of fallout that never existed.  my positives and negatives.  + Crafting system - great improvement + The graphics are improved - yet admittedly dated in comparison to other titles + The settler aspect is a great new addition -- but feels unnecessary to overall story.  That doesn't bother me tremendously, when adding new features the first time this often is the case. This was Bethesda realizing how much people enjoy having ""their house"" so they built it into the game.  Could use improvement as far as fitting it in better with the overall game. + I like the changes that have occurred with the perk system -- it's simple, consolidated and has a lot more options.  - Biggest issue: I'm about 35 hrs in, and the story isn't as good as the others but there are bright points.  Sometimes characters are flat - but again, true for Fallout 3 and all RPG's I can think of.  - Bethesda physics glitches occur (not a big bother to me) -… Expand "

Huge Sprawling World to Loot & Explore 2. Combat is Challenging ( I'm a stealth char ). 3. You can play how you want, you don't have to craft ect.. 4. Locations Reset,  More loot! 5.

You don't have to craft, but its there if you want to. 7. Enemy AI, most times its OK, Sometimes its just silly.  The Bad: 1. The UI is just awful when you need to get something done. In some cases its 'ESC' to leave a menu while other times its 'TAB'.  Sometimes, its a mix of both...hell you may even have to hit ""ENTER"". 2. Inventory is a bit messy, sorting helps, but finer control needed. 3. Some things just aren't clear, try assigning a settler to job, without using Google. 4. Lots of cringe worthy dialog from NPC's 5. Frame rate can drastically drop in some areas ( < 10 FPS ). 6. The suicide enemies really rub me the wrong way 7.

Yiyas,"Nov 13, 2015",8," Fallout 4 is an improvement to almost every mechanical aspect of the Fallout franchise. While that has left less time to fulfil some parts of the game, it is far from 'betraying the franchise'.

While that has left less time to fulfil some parts of the game, it is far from 'betraying the franchise'. I believe it is a huge step forward to progress the franchise as the game plays far better than before.  The changes to VATs combat, critical attacks, container handling, loot rewards, puzzles, random situations and environment are all improvements. Compared to all the other games I am having more fun playing the game than before and have not looked at the game once and said ""you know what, this needs to be modded so much it's not even the original anymore"". The major additions I'd say for the game are the Power Armour (which I don't use and haven't needed to but will create another character to play with), the weapon modifications and the Settlements. Each one is a fantastic feature of the game and the sheer level of customisation from them is really rewarding and gives that brilliant sense of 'this is MY game'.  I would say the only feature lacking is the dialogue. Dialogue has been simplified into 4 options and there is rarely a SPECIAL or Skill based check in conversations. While this does mean a very charismatic character will cheese their way through almost every conversation it does leave you feeling that your character is not really the expert of science or the cunning survivalist. While it doesn't cater as much to hardcore players (now I say hardcore but really only those who are obsessed with RP)  it does cater for a majority of players. Yes your character is voiced. It is an amazing feature, to hear the emotion in your player, to actually hear yourself interacting with the environment. There is no choice in voice or pitch but for the first ever voiced FO game I am not complaining as the blank and empty lines of text are pretty depressing.  In addition, Karma is removed. It's great. No longer does some magical sound dictate whether what you are doing is right or wrong. Instead your companions influence your actions, while some promote drug addiction and stealing, others promote lawfulness, selfishness, haggling, hacking, lockpicking, etc, nobody says what is actually good or evil. When it comes to that crossroads of who you will side with there is really no good or evil answer. You pick who you want to be and you can be the good guy in all of them because, and here's my favourite the part, if you think its the right thing to do then that's all that matters.  The only reason I wouldn't give this game any more than 8 is because of the dialogue. It's obvious that dialogue is more important to others, and that one flaw means a score of 0, but for me I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Perhaps it is because I liked the voice itself and enjoyed the personality of my character but if you are on the wall about playing the game you should watch some Let's Plays to see if that one downside is worth rating the game with angst.  P.S. my favourite feature: the game hasn't crashed once for me, and I can easily alt-tab during loading screens in borderless.… Expand "

(NEW EDIT: After over 100 hours of playing, I still haven't finished the game, but I have seen much more of what the game has to offer.  I have changed my review from a 9 to an 8... but I've already played the game for over one hundred hours.  And it is very worth it, whether it's an 8 or a 9.)  I still believe most of the people who give this game under a 5 either hated Fallout 3 or Bethesda games in general, or ragequit in frustration after getting mini nuked or otherwise exploded for the umpteenth time.  Or came from 4/8chan.  Fallout 4's main standout is that the combat is much improved. The enemies are much smarter and more exciting to fight (Feral Ghouls in particular).  EDIT: The combat can be punishing at times, even on normal difficulty.  Getting power armor early on is just something different.  And the punishing difficulty is probably tuned with the knowledge that you have power armor access from early on.  The new system isn't better or worse, but it is different - and before you get accustomed to the difficulty it will leave you in a tough spot when deciding whether or not to go grab your armor.  I think I personally prefer the longer buildup to getting power armor, and then being able to wear it permanently. But after you've played the game a bit you can better gauge when you may need power armor and leave suits at different settlements to make it slightly less of a pain to manage.  The difficulty of some settlement defense missions is probably the biggest problem in terms of combat difficulty, because you often don't have time to (fast) travel to your main settlement to pick up your armor, before (fast) travelling to the settlement under attack.  Before I built up my defenses at several settlements I had a few fights that I had to reload far in excess of a dozen times before I was successful.  Fallout 4 combat definitely has some rage quit inducing potential (and I think some of the negative reviews here are a good indication of that - though they would likely never admit that the ""dumbed down"" game is actually kicking the hell out of them).  ""The RPG elements aren't as cut down as people are suggesting IMO,"" is what I said previously.  I was wrong.  The RPG elements are very cut down.  The dialogue wheel and its abbreviated choices are awful, and the four options you get almost always boil down to yes/no/sarcastic/more information.  You cannot really play the Fallout 4 protagonist as an evil character through dialogue choices.  Moreover, charisma is the only stat that matters in conversation.  Charisma in general is very powerful, too much so in my opinion.  The Local Leader perk is ****  It should either be moved down to 1-3 charisma category, or it should be entirely removed from the game and all players should have supply lines and store building by default.  Having to have 6 charisma +3-4 perks for all settlement options is ****  Having no other int/perk checks for outside the box dialogue choices is also ****  The Witcher showed that deep character protagonists aren't a death knell for RPGs, but that the choices you do get to make should make an impact.  There isn't much impact from the yes/no/sarcastic options of FO4.  All in all, counter to what I first said after playing only for 10-20 hours, the RPG elements have taken a big hit, and this is ultimately the main reason why I lowered my score from a 9 to an 8.  My previous main gripe remains, although somewhat abated: the outside world seems rather dead. You go up to a building with raiders in it and there are often no raiders outside. No guards, no sentries, you just walk up and enter the building. Now, there are places that absolutely do have outside raiders, and some of them are pretty challenging/silly, like a place you are likely to come across early on with a raider in power armor and a fat man occupying a great firing position...  EDIT:  The outside world gets more lively as certain events occur in the wasteland and as you move south.  But other areas, particularly the northwest of the map where you start, are still quite dead.  I suppose this is intentional.  I would suggest new players to push forward in the main quest a bit before going off on your own if you want a more exciting wasteland.  It remains my opinion that there are legitimate complaints about this game, but as far as a new Bethesda open world game release goes... Fallout 4 is one of the better ones, and almost all of the previous games with rockier starts are now classics (after much patching/modding/DLC).  I do think FO4 will only get better.  And we can only hope the dialogue wheel and abbreviated RPG system dies a painful death as a result of the outcry for butchering much of Fallout 4's RPG elements.… Expand "

Bethesda seem to optimize their games so well, I've never had a problem anyway. Animations have improved greatly from past instalments, however there are some clipping issues and awkward limb moments that get stuck in rather amusing positions.

I still had a great deal of fun with the game but in the end I couldn't put up with the constant crashes and nothing I did fixed it. Enter Fallout 4, a lot of people are complaining that it is a dumbed down non-RPG console shooter but I have to disagree. Yes the skill system is gone, but no the perk system is not a more simple system that replaced it. Rather the skills and perks have been combined to make things easier to visually absorb while having the exact same effect as the previous skill system. How many times in New Vegas or Fallout 3 were you really putting 1 point into this and 1 point into that. If you are anything like me you were dumping all 5 points into the skill you needed improved the most at that moment in the game, and fit your ultimate goal for the end game.  Imagine this scenario, you come across a chest, you cannot unlock it because your skill is too low. Which game are we talking about here the great RPG New Vegas or Fallout 4 the non-rpg shooter? BOTH! In new vegas you have to pump your skills to get those chests unlocked as soon as possible, or use a magazine to try and crack open that chest with the loot you want early. In Fallout 4 you simply pick the lock picking perk and gain the ability to unlock the chest. In a way it is a bit more RPG as it is not so prone to min maxing. Nothing you can do will allow you to access the higher level of that perk without leveling up first. The pacing is over all the same, I'll get that computer later, I'll come back to that chest later when I've got the skills to pay the bills!  Going on lets consider the skills in weapons, now instead of putting 1 point into your rifle (Which I'm sure you never really did) you simple choose a rifle perk that increases the damage you do with them, very little if any difference in the over all flow of the game play. It is still an RPG, there is still progression up a system of ever increasing powers and abilities it is simply different.  Fallout 4 feels like Fall Out New Vegas to me, but in addition to the incredible landscape, interesting characters, and involving quests we also have what Gun Runners tried to create, the ability to customize your weapons in great detail. The weapon customization system allows you to take a gun and make it your own, mold it to your needs as you see fit. No longer are you bound to what the game devs deemed fi to place in the game, if you want a sniper rifle with night vision and full auto with a long barrel and fold stock and bayonet on it by God you can make it ! This system also finally makes all the junk you find in Fallout games useful for once!  Couple this with the outpost system which allows you to build your own home and you've got a very deep RPG That allows you to play the way you want to. Yes the dialogue options are limited but it is always very clear which option is going to have the response you want it to. How much time do you really want to spend talking to NPCS any how? I just want the story to progress so I can get on with what I really want to be doing at that point in time. I don't remember a thing that doctor at the start of new vegas said, or anything anyone else said in that game, but I do remember sneaking around in the Vaults reading the documents and computer logs revealing the game lore for myself. THAT is still in Fallout 4 and it is just as rich as ever.  Don't let these cry babies ruin an experience for you , go into it with an open mind and I believe you will find that the game is worth the price and then some. Regarding technical issues I've got a rather low end PC and I run the game at medium settings perfectly fine The graphics are beautiful, the faces are better than any previously in a Fallout game , better than Skyrim by a large margin. With a radiation storm blows in I believe you will be blown away as I was by the smooth and creepy change in the weather, it does not suddenly begin to rain. Rather lightning flashes in the distance, the wind picks, and the sun is covered by black clouds as lightning flashes near the player cause radiation damage.  I've yet to experience any game breaking bugs, the worst I've seen so far is a mole pop up under my dog and send it flying into space. These kinds of things are to be expected in a Bethesda game and they always have been. Ever since I saw a main quest character in Morrowind float into the ceiling and disappear forever before allowing me to complete my quest I've known to expect these sorts of things. They were in Fallout New Vegas as well!  Play the game for yourself, watch a live stream! Don't take some sour persons word for it!… Expand "

The love and care which gave birth to Fallout 4 is clearly seen and I sincerely believe Bethesda gave this game their best effort. In my eyes the end result really shines, but I understand that this is not the case for all. To use an older engine is not a sin, since they reworked it to the next level and introduced us many next-gen graphical gimmicks which bring the wasteland to life. Special mention to the atrocious shadows and lighting from Skyrim which are now beautiful and purposeful.  After playing Fallout 4, Fallout 3 seems like a proof-of-concept and New Vegas a playable demo =) I salute Bethesdas stubborness to iterate their concept rather than build everything from scratch. This is a new and so far best version of Fallout universe, not a groundbreaking new game.  This game is not perfect, the long development cycle is visible in some last-gen textures and meshes, but this is something that modders or perhaps Bethesda themselves will fix (remember HD patch for Skyrim?) And complaining about textures and meshes while ignoring all the greatness of core mechanics and engine improvement is just... silly. If my car is powerful and great to drive I couldn't care less about last season rims or fading paintwork.  I like the evolved skill and perk system from Skyrim, which hides tedious statistics under the bonnet. People **** how rpg elements have been dismissed but they ARE there, just not shown in sheets. Role playing  is about playing a ROLE, not fiddling with stats. Stats are there to constrain your abilities to your role, but they're not something that has to be visible and fiddled with. From paper RPG:s they've been a necessary nuisance and I'm glad Bethesda agreed with my minority vision and hid them from plain view. Or would you really like to see some virtual dice-throwing before each shot?  Quests, dialogue and writing is far from Bioware quality, but they're in a league of their own. In my wet dreams I'd like to see Bethesda and Bioware join ranks. Imagine Bethesda's modular openness with Bioware's dramatic content? Drool,...  I'm not saying the content is bad, by no means! Voice-acting is a huge leap from Skyrim and the wasteland is now an exceptionally lively place with people going about their business, chatting and bickering. Quests are interesting and have some nice twists and on a whole they are more interesting than tedious, and do not sacrifice replay value.  My only gripe is with the FOV and mouse smoothing. These suck and require too much fiddling to be changed. That's the ONLY whine I've found. Not bad Bethesda, not bad at all. Fix those annoyances, please. For all the else, Kudos and Respect.

Jarvis,"Nov 12, 2015",8," It's amazing how much bad press this game has gotten, especially when you look at the actual complaints.

Fallout 4 is pretty similar fallout 3, just with some changes, most good, some a little disappointing. I'm Gonna try and get the negatives out of the way first.  -Some environments are too big, causing the frame rate to drop. It's not constant, and only happens in certain areas, and it doesn't drop too far either, just enough to be annoying.  -During conversations with NPC's, you only have four options to pick from at a time. Each option usually gives you four more to choose from so you can continue the conversation, But fallout three had much more options than this.  -this game has less survival elements. Stimpacks can't be administered to specific limbs, and weapons cant break.  -And now, the con that irks me the most, The skills have been assimilated into perks. Unlike in previous installments, Instead of gradually upgrading your skills as the game goes along, all the skills are now perks as well, meaning you cant customize your character quite as much as would be desired.  And now for the pro's, -The games appearance is very enthralling. Their is a lot of detail put into practically everything. I have heard a lot of criticism branching from people claiming the graphics are terrible, which is contrary to the truth. The game has a very bright color scheme, (Yes, this is an apocalypse game witch acknowledges the existence of color's other than brown and grey.) This can highlight some of the poorer parts of the game (such as a few noticeable decals on objects instead of details on the 3D model,) Overall, the bright colors makes the games graphics look... different? Whatever the word you wanna go with, it doesn't look bad, just unusual. And the game makes up for this with many beautifully constructed environments.  -Weapon modification gives a wide variety of possibilities for different status and affects, making your load out more personal.  -The town building feature is a nice way to spend time and immerse yourself in the games universe. You don't need to constantly check on the town, just occasional, so if you don't care for it, you only need to have an adequate town made.  -The combat is much more advanced than in previous installments. V.A.T.S is now in slow motion instead of stopping time entirely, This sounds like it would make it more difficult to use, but time still moves very slowly in this version, so its really doesn't make much difference. Melee attacks are actually fun to use now as most blows from a melee attacks will either push an enemy back or even knock them over,( you can also whack enemy's with your gun) compared to how in fallout 3, in which they basically just did damage, and occasionally made an enemy stumble, which kind of killed immersion. Similarly, the way your dog act's in combat is more realistic. Instead of working exactly like a melee weapon with wheels, your dog usually will either restrain enemy's by biting their hands or feet, or tackle them to the ground and bite them. Basically, your dog attacks enemy's the way a real dog would. Finally, you're power armor (which is now customizeable) works less like an equippable item, and more like a vehicle, each specific part has it's own health and can brake, you can't carry it around with you, you find a place to keep it, and when you use it, it has basically the same affects as previous games (enhanced strength protection etc,)  Overall, I really enjoy fallout 4, and really don't understand why people are acting like it's the worst game ever made. I am disappointed in a few regards, but not enough to make me hate it, It is still a very fun game, And definitely worth a buy if you're a fan of fallout or the open world genre.… Expand "

It''s hard to even know where to begin.  Right off the bat, I felt a deep and visceral connection to my wife and child.  Fallout 4 really made me feel, which I have never seen before in a roleplaying game.  The story really hits some emotional notes early on, and has a great sense of adventure and ominousness.  It loses the latter two qualities about 2/3s of the way through the campaign, but this is in the wake of a very original and emotionally charged plot twist.  The whole ""synth"" concept felt a little half baked, but it does make for a more morally nuanced story than anything we've seen before in Fallout.  The combat is amazing.  It is FPS quality.  I remember my amazement when I first saw an enemy lean out from behind a wall to take shots, or blind fire from behind cover.  The world feels alive.  This is something I felt Oblivion had that was missing in Fallout 3 and Skyrim, but its back in Fallout 4.  Returning to a location you've already been to can present new quests, and an even more pleasant surprise is that even refusing quests can have complicated. I remember once I decided not to help an NPC out with his problems, only to find he got himself killed trying to handle the situation by his lonesome.  There is a sense of organicness in Fallout 4 that just seems to be missing in RPGs.  There are slickly done scripted events (such as when I entered a dark room and suddenly all its lights turned on and I found four heavily armed people pointing guns at me), the conversational animations and believable and intricate and add a great sense of intimacy and believability.  I will never forget the pain I saw in a synth's eyes who described himself as ""discarded Institute trash"".  Nothing feel formulaic.  Its the little touches that make the game great.  The way documents like newsletters are presented in their original form rather than green text, or the player character whispers ""yes"" when he/she successfully picks a lock, or the way everything from stimpak injections to drinking water is animated.  The characters are a mixed bag.  Nick Valentine is a character as well written as anything in Mass Effect 2.  Other characters become painfully one dimensional.  Paladin Danse is nothing but a soldier.  Piper seems loveable at first but soon appears to be nothing more than a reporter.

Don't listen to all the hateful gamers on here who pined for a sequel to Fallout 3 and when it wasn't perfect they slam it with a ridiculous low score.  Look more at the professional reviewer's scores and you'll get a better idea of what this game is like. I'll guarantee that half of the gamers haven't played the game or played very little before reviewing the game.  The number of locations to explore is one of the biggest Bethseda has ever created.  I don't know if the map is bigger, but once you get close to the couple of towns or cities there are so many points of interest so close together it seems mind boggling.  I think the level design is amazing in that each building seems like a realistic remnant of a what was once a full functional home, business, factory etc.  There is something fun, cool or unique to find hidden away in each location as well so exploring never gets old.  The number of weapons you can wield is amazing. 100 hours in and I'm still finding cool different weapons to punish enemies with like the a freezing gun, a gun that shoots syringes and strange ancient artifacts fused with technology to become powerful weapons.  Crafting is the best I've ever seen it in any game.  You can actually modify any weapon or armor at least a couple levels.  Anything in the game's world can be picked up and broken down for use in modding.  I find my inventory constantly maxed because I'm constantly grabbing old phones and microscopes for their copper and other useful elements.  The companions are numerous and varied and spending enough time with one grants you a unique perk which gives special bonuses, so this makes me want to play with each companion long enough to get that bonus.  BTW, the companion Deacon has some of the funniest lines in the game.  There are at least 3 factions to play with with different side missions and bonuses to each.  Settlements can be founded and rebuilt with the build tool which uses the game's crafting elements some more.  This system is fun but was a little dumbed down for consoles.  Hopefully patches to this will be made soon.  Speaking of dumbed down, the game was obviously designed for consoles and ported to PC, which is frustrating that it doesn't have a better menu system or inventory management but didn't deter me from enjoying the main game.  If this is a reason to give a game a ZERO than you need to grow up a little. haha  At first I was frustrated with the enemies ability to instantly spot me and start attacking before I could spot them, but I just started sneaking more often and used the VATS system to spot enemies that are hidden behind steal grates, buildings and bushes so that solved that grievance.People have complained about bugs, and I've only seen 4 in 100 hours of playing.  1 crash to desktop.  2 load screen hangs wher I rebooted and a funny glitch where my companion was swimming through the commonwealth.  That's it.  That's about average for a PC game so I don't see the big deal.  There are a few issues I did have with the game.  I have a 4 year old gaming rig PC and the Fallout doesn't look too hot.  Last year I could play Tomb Raider on near maxed out settings yet Fallout looks too similar to Fallout 3.  Herein lies the problem: Bethseda keeps using the exact same system which it used for Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Skyrim.  You can tell because some buildings require loading times and the NPC animations are still as stiff and bugged.  Time to create a new system for your games, Bethseda, because you are starting to look dated compared to GTA V and the Witcher.  Maybe the user scores will help drive Bethseda to make some major changes.  So, if you haven't tried this game, maybe wait a good month for some patches or modders to fix a few issues, or maybe even wait until the game comes down in price.  I don't regret my purchase at all and after 100 hours am looking to probably spend 100 more.  There's a few dozen buildings left to loot and I'm halfway through the main story and I'm having a blast.… Expand "
doogs,"Nov 10, 2015",8,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          A great game. Fun and entertaining. However there's two types of Fallout players...  1. You like Fallout 1-3: Choice driven to a degree but still relatively linear with it's story approach. Karma played a role somewhat but ultimately didn't affect the players decision too much. Your character had a set goal, that was in a sense 'noble' and ultimately in most player's cases ended nobly. The game rewards more for positive karma so naturally most people chose the high ground. Exploration is very fun, as with any Fallout game but it kind of held your hand a little in terms of game play.  2. You like Fallout NV: Very very choice driven, heavily story focused, decisions held weight right through til the finale. The world felt very much somber, at war and quite depressing. You had no set goal rather than revenge, simple. This method allowed people to take either side of the karma aspect which provided more an experience in story telling. It just felt more open.  This being said. I love all of the aforementioned deeply but how does this reflect on Fallout 4?  Fallout 4 has gone back to the 1-2 approach of giving you something noble (SPOILER: finding your child and avenging your dead partner). This isn't necessarily bad at all. The overall experience of Fallout 4 is fun. Which after all is what I'm all about; having fun! But I just felt it spread itself a little too thin in terms of story development and really motivating me to follow the main quest when there's so much else Id rather do. Sorry but I'd rather build settlements than find my stolen child. Hopefully DLC will flesh out the world a little more so I can feel more invested in this installment. If you want fun this is for you but if you're looking for more feeling and emotion then go play New Vegas.  I can recommend if you have a PC get it on that as the modding community creates a lot more playable value and depth to the world.… Expand "

I have a degree in game design and I will speak about how this game plays out. I have about currently 30 hours in playing so far so I feel I have a good grasp on everything. I will not be speaking about the story because A) I haven't played through it all yet B) wanted to focus more on the game play anyway  Okay with that intro out of the way I want to say how much I enjoy this game. From the start there are so many different paths you can take and go about playing it out. Everywhere you go you can find something new. You can shape how you want to play by choosing what makes you S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and not get penalized for how you play and that's great. You can have a large pool of companions that you can choose to drag around with you and help you go about the wasteland. One thing I will emphasize about this game is the CHOICES!  Something I see many people complain about is that that world is ""Small."" Sure if you look at world size it kinda is however looking at how they designed it, it is very vertical. You can go into a majority of buildings, go onto the roofs, or delve into the basements of these buildings. So the game is more built up then wide which isn't always a bad thing.  There is a lot of lore in the game, I actually find myself a bit overwhelmed with all that you can read with every dungeon. You can hack terminals and read their logs or find different holotapes to listen to that give you interesting insights on different back stories.  All the mechanics are relatively simple and easy to understand. The only thing that took me a bit to catch on was finding out how much radiation you have and how to trigger a critical strike when using V.A.T.S other than that it is pretty solid.  There is a system where you can manage different settlements throughout the map and build your own towns. I have spent a lot of time on this and there are many benefits that translate into the exploration phases. So here is how it goes. You go out and explore, while you explore you gather materials that allow you to expand your settlements. You build up and go out again, coming back upgrading each settlement more and more.Then it gets to a point where you can make money off them which makes buying stuff easier. However, If you don't place defenses then your settlements get attacked and you will have to go defend it.  My only gripe with this system is how annoying the building can be. Sometimes it locks where you don't want it to or just doesn't want to place even though there is nothing in the way. All in all, still a fun thing to do especially if you aren't exactly the best at shooting.  So far, for me, bugs have been few and minor. (I'm on PC) The most 'major' bug I run into is when I tab out sometimes the HUD gets all weird and off centered and I have to restart the game to fix it. Other than that, nothing major has happened. Other bugs I have run into are bouncy water that flings you about 80 feet in the air. Me and Dogmeat were having a grand ol' time bouncing around though. All I had to do was reload my save and it fixed itself. Terminals sometimes don't show text and you have to fiddle with it a bit for it to show. That is all I have run into in terms of bugs.  If I could praise anything about this game the most it has to be the level design. It is EXTREMELY good. I have studied level design and that crap is hard, but they nailed it here. The areas you go through seamlessly and subtly guide you through itself and gets you to where you need to go. I found it really difficult to get lost in any dungeon and that is a good sign. If you wonder off the path they have for you, you can find something cool, probably have to fight something for it but that is a good system of reward and punishment.  People have complained about the speech wheel thing which I can understand, sometimes not fully knowing what you are gonna say is not the most helpful but I see what they were trying to get at with streamlining it. I don't mind the wheel system but the full chat screen that I have seen in previous fallout games wouldn't have hurt either.  All in all, a great game. Certain aspects of it could have used tweaking but still all around solid. A pat on the back to you Bethesda.… Expand "

Bought a new R9 380 4GB (on i5-2500k, 16GB Ram) and can run on ultra @ 1080p smoothly with no stuttering or glitches.  I think the intro/character creation was excellent, makes sense with the plot but allows us to have a glimpse at the pre-war/fallout aspect which was a nice addition (albeit brief).  At first I thought the lack of skills was dumbing down - its not, its all been consolidated into the SPECIAL/Perks system with the perks. (if you have max charisma but zero persuation games normally fail you, but under the new system its the max charisma that matters which makes more sense - and perks can be taken to make this more succesful).  On the map size, it may appear smaller but I have found its not just a case of being densely packed but there is less ""dead"" or ""inactive"" space, and lots of small buildings are open in the world (not needing you to enter tiny shacks like before which was annoying).  My only gripe so far is the controls/ui so I am knocking this down to 9 but I am sure I will get used to it. Actually I don't like the lack of control over the characters voice (many games use EQ/pitch effects to customise a voice actors recorded lines) but this is a personal preference it doesnt make the game bad so I wont knock a point off for it. (nothing wrong with the voice btw - I just like to customise things).  For what its worth I am not new to the series or Bethesda being an older gamer who still plays FO1,2 (and tactics since im a pervert apparently - its actually a great tactical rpg) and Morrowind etc.  Biggest tip to enjoy the game - drop all preconceptions, just take it as a game in its own right and you will be pleased if you like open world exploration, the fallout settings and humour and especially the SHENANIGANS.

They TOLD EVERYONE that we were going to be picking up EVERYTHING because of the incredible need for materials.   This would only have been a true bad thing, if they hadn't already informed us that we would need all these materials for the Mod system and/or the settlement building.

What age are we living in anyway when a game that lets you do as many things as this dose without bothering with other people gets some basement dwellers to still spew there venom all over the rest of us. If you want to play Planescape Torment then please go play that **** game, it bored the hell out of me just watching a friend of mine play it, he loved it so much. Here is a little hint to all you old timers out there with nostalgic nerd glasses at the late 90s RPG games, there boring like watching paint dry. I also could not get into the great and beloved Morrowind, yes I said it Morrowind is almost completely unplayable for me, I dare anyone to try and confront me with a straight face on how to even get started in that primitive mess of a game. Skyrim is one of my most favorite games ever and I am not ashamed of saying it at all, it paved the way for a new kind of RPG, it has something that even Oblivion does not have and that is savage power. It also opened the PC world to adding to the world with community creations, not unlike table top RPGs did in the 80s. This year another great peace of gaming was **** all over as well on the PC, I will not name it here because it’s not about that game, but I think some of this has to do with what both are suffering from on the PC. The PC community in the past decades have been dominant when it came to better graphic options, controller versatility and just a higher optimization on the gamming experience. However the past 4 years have seen gaming design shift even faster then in the past to where the money is flowing and that is now the console markets.  This has a group that was once in a position of smarmy jabs at this or that is better on a PC to now complaining when a game is designed with a control and the latest consoles in mind yet still is around $60.  I feel there frustration to a degree, yet this was bound to happen given how useless the PC community really was when the times were good. Playing a game is not about what hardware you have was the line that console players always said to PC owners, the answer was always pay more and get a monster PC and then tell us that same line that Hardware does not count. Well now that the economy is absolute below **** scum now we have PC owners who maybe 4 years ago got a new mid-level gaming PC start to ask why the hell are all these new games working better on the current console hardware and seem made just for a controller. Now I will throw to all you complainers out there the line that we gave to them poor console players in the past, upgrade your PC or get a console, high end is just that high end, you can always scale it down if need be but I suspect a prideful mindset is at work here. Games themselves are not being reviewed as purely on PC right now because of all the things I have stated, an anger is taking hold as a realization is happening that they are getting games that are not using PC hardware to the fullest anymore and its because that is not where the money is to be had now.… Expand "

I think once we lose the lens of how the game fits into the current time, it will turn out to be a great sequel to Fallout 3 and FNV.  Tradeoffs: -High end graphics traded for game scope -Dialogue options traded for fully voiced dialogue -Bugginess for (again) scope and freedom  Additionally, gun play has improved significantly and I only use VATS when things get particularly heavy.  I've put serious time into the crafting/junk collecting and settlement building, and it has been great fun.  The game runs well on my PC, and I've heard of but have not encountered any significant bugs.  There is no FOV slider, which apparently is a huge issue to some gamers, but I don't care.  Most importantly, I have fun playing this game.  Let me rephrase that.  Fallout 4 is a fun game.

I was not expecting Witcher graphics because let's face it - this is Fallout.  They're not breaking graphics records or creating new ways to approach AI, but the Fallout feel is there.  The soundtrack is vastly improved from previous titles; however, sometimes the music drones and continuously lends to ambience when a more natural, scoreless atmosphere would do.  Many will complain about animations and facial flaws, but I'm pleasantly surprised with the amount of personality they've injected into each character.  No one NPC really looks the same as another.  You don't get the sense that they're recycling voice actors either, although there are familiar ""faces"" from previous titles that we expected to hear.  The voiced dialogue is a boon, in my opinion.  While select NPC voice actors are terrible, the majority of conversation is realistic, convincing, and interesting.  I rebuilt my PC to accommodate the seemingly intensive system specifications that were published recently.  Granted, much of the PC community knew that they were inflated as a safety byproduct, so when my high-mid tier/low-low high-tier rig auto adjusted to Ultra settings upon install I was pleasantly surprised.  FPS drops are common while up high in say a city, or a mountain that high (which I haven't yet found).  This is due to FPS being tied to engine performance, which is good and bad.  Everything will typically load the way it should, but those familiar graphical bugs are back - laggy water loading, meshy land features forgetting to render right away.  It's all what we've seen before.  Regardless of a carbon copy menu and inventory system, it still feels a bit more responsive than previous pip-boy inventories.  With the addition of the favorites quick menu, time spent in your pip-boy is vastly cut down.  The radar system is marginally improved, but overall a let down.  It feels like a prototype, or a filler for very early alpha testing.  I can find my way to nearby beacons easily, but I find myself referencing the map much more than I used to.  Gunplay is vastly improved.  When Todd Howard mentioned it should feel like a modern shooter, he wasn't wrong.  Smooth, fluid animations and reactive hitboxes make the V.A.T.S. system that much more satisfying.  Companion A.I. is stlil relatively poor, but much more engaging.  Character function relies more on the perk chart this time.  No longer can you level lockpicking or hacking, but instead you must elect to level certain perks to achieve these abilities.  It lends to much deeper customization and character backstory, but can be frustrating to miss out on certain things that you wouldn't have if in Fallout 3.  I'm still clammering for more as I sit here waiting for work to end so I can get back out into the Wasteland - that's the ultimate stamp of approval.   I think with the mod community coming to the rescue, this game can achieve a quick 10.  Remember - the hype was created by the gaming community, not guaranteed by Bethesda.

They kept the core gameplay concepts that were great in Fallout 3/NV/Skyrim, they improved on basically everything in the game, and they got rid of things that quite frankly didn't work.  For instance, the ""karma"" system was a weak gameplay mechanic that just overcomplicated your decision-making in the game and it's thankfully gone.  I honestly don't understand why anyone felt like that system was valuable.  It wasn't like the Mass Effect Paragon/Renegade system that affected your abilities and was based entirely on how you made decisions (not dumb stuff like, did you pickpocket that homicidal maniac).  It was silly and distracting and thankflly it's gone.  The consequences of your devious actions will be dealt with in the real world, not a theoretical one full of inscrutable algorithms.  The weapon/armor crafting system is fantastic.  It's deeper and more interesting/flexible than what New Vegas offered without getting too complicated at all.  The scrap/junk system is also great once you get the hang of it, and I say this as someone who doesn't usually play survival crafting games.  It's far less complicated than those games, so you won't spend all of your time obsessing over harvesting the right materials; basically the interface is so streamlined it makes what could've been an extremely cumbersome part of the game very easy.  The combat is still similar enough to Fallout 3/NV that you won't be lost, but they made minor improvements that make a huge difference.  First of all, being in VATS only slows the game down a little bit, so you still have to move pretty quickly, but you have enough extra time to queue up a few actions before executing your plan.  Enemies still have pretty bad combat AI, but it's much improved over previous Fallout/Elder Scrolls games.  Combat is still fun, even if it's not exactly the best FPS experience you've ever had, it's still better than the prior games.  Guns definitely have a better feel to them than in prior games.  It's more challenging to get critical hits staring down the iron sights than it was in previous games, so combat feels a lot more engaging and not just a matter of pointing at someone's head and clicking.  As far as bugs, I haven't encountered anything significant at all after many hours with the game.  No crashes, no freezes, no corrupted save files and no quest-breakers or /stuck issues.  Granted I'm running a 970M 6GB machine but in all honesty having a powerful rig never stopped GameBryo games from breaking before.  I'm running on High settings at 1920x1080 and it's really smooth for me.  I turned down AA and sampling a little just to alleviate some of the minor stuttering I was getting sometimes, but I was able to get through the entire big battle in Concord (loads of enemies, long draw distances, lots of physics stuff going on) without any framerate issues.  I'm sure others are having their own experiences, but for me this game is smooth as hell, and smoother than any other GameBryo game has ever been at launch for me.  This is absolutely a Fallout game as much as Fallout 3 or New Vegas were Fallout games.  I honestly don't feel like I'm playing the same game as some of these ""0/10"" and ""2/10"" reviewers here.  I think some people just blew up the hype wayyyyyyyy too much in their minds and seem to be disappointed that it isn't some Elysian paradise of video games.  Ultimately, if you liked Fallout 3/New Vegas, I think you're going to love this game.  If you kind of liked those games  but felt maybe they were a bit too clunky for you, it's worth giving this game a shot for you because they've done so many excellent improvements to those systems that it could make the difference for you.… Expand "

To start with the graphics, they are fantastic given the size of the game, and a major improvement over previous installments. Bethesda has always put gameplay and story above just making a pretty game, and that has always worked well for them and works well in this game as well. Minor graphics glitches are to be expected in releases of such massive games, beta testing simply can't catch everything that hundreds of thousands of people playing the game will experience.  The changes in gameplay are likewise excellent, but very different. The voiced protagonist does slightly limit dialogue and the dialogue system itself has been changed, but this doesn't detract overall from the game in my opinion. V.A.T.S. is massively improved, companions have better A.I. and overall the gameplay changes work well. If you wanted Bethesda to make a copy of their older games with a new story you'd be better off modding the older games instead of whining about how a newer game is different than an older game and you no like.  The map is the same size of Skyrim (massive) and with more playable areas than Skyrim (even more massive) complaints about the raw size of the map are simply silly.  Overall great game.… Expand "

Fallout 4 is a fun ride with a number of improvements and a settlement management system that could be its own separate game. Using your settlements as farms to earn income, however the interface for said system is very clunky and does not integrate well, with settlement quests being lacking. The game is visually average and textures range from OK to sub-par, and the writing is the same old meh in 3. If you were looking for something more like New Vegas in terms of quests then you may be disappointed. The game however has lots of content, making it satisfying to customize your character, and the exploration is as good.

The combat has been redone to feel far bother, VATs is now more of a tool than a necessity to properly aim as it was in previous games. The world is lively, fun to explore, and just as expansive as other hit Bethesda titles. Weapon and armor modifications are a fun addition, and add plenty of depth to an already long list of gear. The base-building, while finicky at times, is a welcome addition, and serves as a fun distraction to the main game (though I can see myself and others doing far more with it, the chances to make elaborate basis with high-tech defenses are almost endless). There were a few problems however. The new dialogue system, while more streamlined, takes away a bit of the charm of previous games' dialogue systems. Rather than choosing a specific sentence to say (many of which were crammed full of classic ""Fallout"" humor), the new dialogue system feels bland. The options are woefully untelling of what your character will actually say, and your character may spout words that you never intended them to say. This kind of system make work fine in other games, but it removes something that made Fallout just that little bit more interesting. The glitches are still abundant (though the vast majority of them hardly hamper the experience). What is a problem though are the framerate issues, which can turn an intense firefight into a battle against the choppiness of the game. While these issues technical issues are being worked on, they must be taken into account. This game, in my opinion, still lives up to the Fallout Name. Its vast array of strengths outshine its few weakness, and I can feel the traditional Bethesda charm oozing in every inch of this game. Not that I'm trying to invalidate other people's reviews, but quite honestly I can't see what the huge problem is. As a fan of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, I really enjoyed this game. Anyway, in my opinion, this game was certainly a worthy successor  to both of these games, and is certainly going to keep my occupied for months to come.… Expand "

blumens,"Nov 24, 2015",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I think that people commenting on the writing need to consider the immensely difficult task of writing a great story a thousand different times.  Fallout games are massive, and this one is no different. Negative reviews mention that there are few interesting stories in this, but I find ramming colonial ships into skyscrapers and raising a militia to be a fine cup of tea. Not to mention the bitter sips that come with the main quest and its moral ambiguity. This is the masterstroke of the series. With Fallout 3, you're given no real choices. With New Vegas, the good factions unquestionably lead to good endings (NCR, independent, and even House despite what some would say), and the debate centers always around which epilogue really benefits the people the most. With 4 though, I had to spend countless moments of my time debating what good really is, let alone which ending choices would actualize this good. And in the end, you have to do terrible things no matter what you choose to do.  I have to give this game a ten. The universe it has given us is full of character. There are a few issues, however, although the rating stands as other elements have certainly made up for the following:  1) Most importantly, the characters need more. Characterization is what makes RPG games really alive. I fell in love with Piper, and now she seems little more than 7 lines of dialogue I get when I ask for her thoughts. Having characters give a few comments for different locations is a start, but not everything.  2) Main quest should be longer. Incredible story, but it felt short. Felt like the struggle really started and ended in the blink of an eye, and relying on finding Shaun for the beginning of the game doesn't make the following struggle feel more real even if it pads the plot with more content.  3) Some choices were too hastily created just to include all factions. For example, Sturges magically understands teleportation from a few diagrams. Truly, just a small quest before this in which a scientist is recruited for the cause to help Sturges would have made more sense. Balancing is great, but the story arcs don't need to always be parallel or of equal length or difficulty.  Still, despite these issues and some moments of poor writing, I cannot recommend this game enough.  PS: Those angered by the voiced dialogue, we've seen voiceless protagonists go in every other franchise. The jump from Dragon Age Origins to Dragon Age 2 comes to mind. This jump is here to stay, no matter how much whining is done. Truly, just as many people (if not more) would complain of how dated the game felt if there were no voiced dialogue. I remember being sour when voices were introduced in the DA franchise, but I've come to appreciate it, and would recommend trying to accept it. Role-playing can still be very rich if you bend a little and accept a little story being fed to you.… Expand "

The game is good, gameplay is good, combat is by far the best in the last 2 installments (Not going to compare them to the previous ones due to the large differences). Starting off with that, I can easily say that fighting is what you are doing for at least 60% of the time. Yes, the game has bugs and bethesda should not get a free pass for having bugs, but in such an expansive game most people can't help but to understand the bugs (AGAIN, BETHESDA DOES NOT DESERVE A FREE PASS ON HAVING SO MANY BUGS) I have not come across any game breaking bugs but a minority of people have, truthfully bethesda needs to fix the game breaking ones, those ruin video game experiences. Moving onto the graphics, yes, they look outdated but as for the heavy question of if it looks terrible, I wouldn't say so. Yea, fallout is getting outclassed in graphics by a majority of AAA games, but considering them bad just because of comparison is just not right, too many people focus on the graphics and think that if it stays the same then they are not innovating. Next would be story, I will be forward and say I don't pay attention to Bethesda stories most of the time, this one does not seem great and does not make me want to want to complete it, which was the same case as Oblivion, Skyrim and Fallout 3 (New vegas was a hit or miss for me).  Characters are pretty dull, having to interact with them for a quest is like having to ask a wall what to do next, no real memorable characters for me. Skill system and Karma system are what people seem to be the most upset about and I somewhat understand them, the lack of consequence for Karma is pretty lame and the skills were a lot more difficult to manage in the previous ones, making it a bit more interesting, now you can be a god just by leveling up. The perks system is very easy to understand and allows for fast decisions on what you want to do with your lvl up. Going onto the subjective part of the review, I didn't find the change to be that bad, I never really liked the inability to get some perks because of not chosing the right ""S.P.E.C.I.A.L"" abilities, I do understand where people come from when they say a character should not be able to have everything on one run, but I say otherwise, there is no reason to not be able to if you throw enough hours in.  Now that I got the ugly out of the way, time to go into why this is my GoTY.  Exploration  It was always my favorite part of any of these games and it is done right, people like to use the argument that the world is smaller and feels more ""Empty"" but that is flat out bs, every area has a building you can explore loot or even take over. Going into an old vault is always a brand new and great adventure. Yea, there is tons of buildings filled with raidiers and ghouls but what do you expect? It's the wasteland! The game rewards people who love to explore by having good loot handed to them by looking in the right places.  I'll cut off my review with that, great game with flaws, definitely my GoTY.

On the other hand, the map is so full of stuff that, if you choose so, you need never take the same path twice. *) It's not Fallout Van Buren. This is a non-issue for me, but for some, a FPS game will never be acceptable in the Fallout lineup. If you disliked Fallout 3/NV because you had to aim, or feel the game is not Fallout without a skill system, keep moving, this is not for you. *) There is no Low Intelligence or Pure Charisma options. The low intellect dialogue was always amusing, and an opportunity to play without pulling a gun was a thing for some folks. Sadly, those options are out. *) AI is a Crapshoot. Usually, the AI works fine, but on occasion, someone is going to get stuck on the corner of a car that got nudged lightly by an explosion, or get stuck on a doorway because they just tried to run over a small pile of rubble or a dead friend. It does happen, mostly because of how the game engine works. The reason this happens is the same reason you can show up at a location and see two different fights.  Got it? Good. Here come the pros. *) For a FPS, it's good. Not great, good. The accuracy and iron sights system works well with the perk system. Enemies are not laser guided badasses, and have shooting accuracy and skills according to the weapon they have. If you are a sniper, and they have a shotgun, odds are they will not hit you. Further, they know it, and will try their best to get to you. They will also take cover, lean out of it to fire, flee grenades, and sidestep and tumble when moving under fire. It all could be smoother, but for what it is, it's fairly good. *) The side-missions are far more interesting. The world is filled with side missions, from map crossing exterminations to helping a companion lay their past to rest. The writing is tighter on these shorter missions, and the voice acting is generally good. Speaking of... *) The voice acting works. There are some wooden places, but for the most part, the voice acting is good, and it works in a game that has a specific, personal central quest. This is also delightful out in the world, because if you get anywhere near an intelligent creature, usually with stealth but occasionally in combat, it will converse with others of its kind, and generally in an amusing way. *) The Perk System. This system feels very, very fallout. It discarded the boring point system. For the most part, every level gives you something interesting or directly useful, and leads to an interesting choice dynamic. Do you want  an extra %20 to that class of weapons you prefer, or a chance to reset your action points when you kill something in VATS? Oh, that's right... *) VATS. In Fallout 3/NV, VATS would freeze the game. In Fallout 4, VATS merely slows the world down. It is not only more visually interesting, but gives you a sense of urgency that can be real. Further, because they keep moving, if you do not act fast, they might reach cover (or get close enough to pass behind it in the middle of your shot). *) Settlements. If you like building, the settlement system is fun, if occasionally frustrating, and a remarkably good time waster. Settlements can be attacked, but it happens rarely, to avoid disrupting the game. And if building is not your thing, you can completely ignore the entire setup. *) Crafting/Modification. This is a blessing. Instead of an infinite number of different weapons, you have maybe 15, which you can generally modify to your play style. Prefer spewing bullets? That pistol can have an automatic receiver. Sniper? That assault rifle can be rechambered for .50 semi auto. *) Art Direction. Finally, something that is not a dull green or brown. Until you get to the atmospheric Glowing Sea...  Final Verdict: Just go get it already. Steam refund if you really don't like it, because you will know very quickly if you don't.… Expand "

All it does is make you look like a whining idiot who didn't get the toy he wanted.  With that out of the way I'm going to keep this as short as I can. Fallout 4 is a decent looking game with a lot to see and do that will keep you playing long enough to get your value for money. The world is beautiful looking and immersive. It's a lot more dense than that of New Vegas and doesn't lead you as firmly around the map in a preset direction. The combat has been improved a bit and the addition of settlements adds to the game play time and allows you to flex your creative muscles.  That said there are some disappointing aspects to the game. I'm aware New Vegas was developed by Obsidian but it's a shame Bethesda didn't have them on board for this one. The mechanics are somewhat dumbed down, for example the dialogue wheel and your SPECIAL stats, other than charisma, not influencing conversation choices. I can see why they went with the wheel given your character acts out the dialogue but it still feels like a step backwards. A helpful player has already developed a mod that allows you to see the full dialogue options and I recommend that if you miss the old style. I also wasn't a fan of getting power armour so early into the game because I always considered it to be a goal to work towards. As compensation however we are treated to a much more visually interesting world than New Vegas. Surely some of you were disappointed when you finally got to the strip only to realise how boring and depressing it was.  Overall though, the fun has outweighed the bad and for all it's faults this is still a good game. I hope other reviewers grow up and stop giving it a 1 or 2 because they were personally hurt. I hope they learn to recognise that there is both good and bad things to say about almost any game and a fair review explores both before coming to a conclusion.… Expand "

I am enjoying it much more then either Fallout 3 or Skyrim, for different sets of reasons. Is it ""Skyrim with guns""? Yes, very much so. However, the general feel of the game is much better for me. It suffers from a similar but lesser degree of bloat and mid-game drag, being entirely too long and inconsistently paced for much of my 80+ hours. The load times factored into this considerably, but it runs more smoothly then any Bethesda game I've played before, and it's nice to hear my character talk. I got lucky in most cases as regards to bugs, though an issue loading saves near the very end of the game caused me a bit of a scare.  You are the ""Sole Survivor,"" an inhabitant of the Vault 111 fallout shelter who flees the onset of nuclear armageddon in 2077, only to awaken 200 years later, with their spouse murdered and infant son missing. So begins a desperate search through the wasteland known as the Commonwealth, consisting of the ruins of Boston and its environs. In your search you inevitably become a central figure in the lives of many of this region's citizens, and ultimately a war for its control and answers to world-shaking questions: What measure is a non-human? Where do you stand on the scale between freedom and security? What are you willing to do not only to survive, but to thrive, to win? The game is not only open-ended but very morally gray, and whether your choices were right or not is left up to your own interpretation. This is a stark contrast to Fallout 3, which at least from where I was standing concerned a benevolent chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel waging a war for freedom against the totalitarian Enclave.  People say the conversations in this game are a little too Mass Effect, but I think it works just fine. It's also sometimes a lot easier to tell at a glance what your character is actually going to say, barring the wildcard ""Sarcastic"" responses. The companion system is entertaining but far less sophisticated then most other RPGs, with limited dialogue opportunities and wildly varying combat effectiveness for each character. I found myself quite partial to Curie, whose excessive adorability, gifts of Stimpaks, devotion to scientific progress and surprising fighting ability endeared her to me quickly.  The shooting, particularly when using VATS, is enjoyable, especially when your Luck perks sucessfully proc, and there is a satisfying array of guns of all types and calibers, which can be customized to your liking. However, coming from something like Borderlands, Battleborn or Killing Floor 2, the combat overall feels a bit stiff and clunky, and it still seems like you are required to use VATS to succeed in at least some fights, as in Fallout 3. The game's difficulty can also feel a tad erratic- you can tear through a number of engagements before unceremoniously being disintegrated by a nuclear Fat Man shell, which apparently warranted its own achievement.  I can't help but love that there is actually a use for all the junk you find lying around in these sorts of games. I find it amusing you're given Power Armor virtually from the get go, though maintaining it seems to be a much more involved process. You're not only encouraged to grab everything you can find, but rewarded with experience points for using it to craft modifications for your gear and upgrade friendly towns with new stuff- at last, the packrat in me finds vindication. The series seems to be gradually approaching the status of a functional FPS, though that is a far cry from its original form and I am left to wonder. It's a competently executed FPS/RPG, especially compared to its immediate predecessor, but is it really Fallout? That, I regret to say, is not my place to judge.… Expand "

I personally love the settlement building and defending them (and there are many, many mods that expand this feature). The crafting systems are excellent and Survival mode is awesome. All is not pretty with FO4. Character animations need work, Being able to be evil or good and having your decisions have more moral impact in the world (like Witcher 3) would be awesome.

Somehow Bethesda combined the Simulation, FPS, and RPG genres with a dash of anxiety all into one package in Fallout 4.  In the world of Fallout 4, a Nuclear war has left the inhabitants of Boston Massachusetts to fend for themselves without a central government.  In this post-apocalyptic part of the Commonwealth, you play the role of a widowed husband or wife, who’s looking for their child Shaun after being frozen in a Vault for a couple hundred years.  You’ll be building, crafting, shooting and surviving.  The Good and the Ugly. Giving EA a run for their money, Fallout 4 introduced an entire new mechanic to the Fallout series: Settlements; I’d argue this game is ALL about Settlements. Think of it like a dumbed down Sims, but instead of using Simoleons to purchase buildings and furniture, you’re gathering supplies all across the Commonwealth from the remnants of Boston like Hot Plates, Hacksaws, and more.  Basically you’re going to MacGyver the crap out of this.  Each Settlement has several needs: Food, Water, Defense, and Beds; and they can populated by Settlers, and Companions (companions accompany you in-game & have side stories).  Anyone who likes Simulation games will accidently carry themselves into the wee early-morning building….and building until you run out of resources and are forced back into the wasteland to scavenge more.  The Settlement system can feel pretty beta at times.  Even with all the expansions added, furniture and structures are limited in number.  Placement of objects can be odd as there isn’t always a snap system to have things completely symmetric like walls (Gaps are never a good thing in any scenario).  It’s not always totally clear where an object goes after you choose to “store” it.  Almost none of the placeable objects have tooltips, and the ones that do are not descriptive enough; for example, it’s almost impossible to tell what Bathtubs do unless you googled it, or you’re a Brahim whisperer.  All objects that can be built always have a “just went through nuclear holocaust” aesthetic, even though you just built it from scratch.  Why am I building a brand new glass door, if the glass is going to be broken already?  Who broke that glass?  WE JUST BUILT IT!  Despite all its flaws, I wouldn’t be playing Fallout 4 as much as I have been without Settlements.  They provide a way to get away from all the gloom and doom and reinstate that “life flourishes in the darkness” sorta thing.  The game feels alive in your settlements, and you can customize a house of your own, for your settlers, heck even Dogmeat’s.  Fast-traveling into one of your Settlements can trigger a dynamic event that usually pitt you and your comrades against Gunmen, Ghouls, and others.  It’s very rewarding, and literally having the shirt off of someone’s back come straight to your door is very useful. (You can loot those em up’)  Love it or hate it, Settlements are what makes Fallout 4 a unique first person shooter and role playing game & definitely worth investing in if you’re a fan of those genres.  Simulation lovers beware, all the kinks haven’t been worked out yet; Fallout 4 is a ginormous game & maybe a little too big for it’s own good (tons of things I haven’t even mentioned yet, like Power Armor)  however it may be worth checking out.  You may just end up loving it like I did!… Expand "

Exploration is the meat of the game, but that's what Bethesda do best. They remain one of the top players when it comes to building an interesting open world. So, much as with Skyrim, the best bits are the little things you come across on the way to other areas of the map. I'd argue that the dungeons have more variety than in Skyrim, or Fallout 3 - two of Bethesda's best known releases.  They've also put little twists on old enemies (faster, tunneling mole rats are one example), and if you play on one of the harder modes such as Survival, there are going to be times when just shooting at the angry mutant bear just doesn't cut it and you have to think of a new approach. Other new additions - the settlement building springs to mind - are fantastic, and the art design is excellent overall.  It's not New Vegas, as it does lack the sense of being part of a greater world outside of the playable map. And the bad guys never quite seem as threatening as Caesar's Legion did.

There is so much content, I've been skipping the main quest line and doing the side quests for many days  now.  So much to the game I think I might have to do a 2nd play through or spend the next few months playing and exploring everything.  Ignore the bad reviews, like everyone else I know that actually plays the game they really like it. Even the crafting system that I thought was clumsy at first (leaves a lot of room for improvement) I got a handle on it after a while.  Just give it a chance, you'll see, you won't be disappointed.… Expand "

With the modding community these games have, and developer support (Bethesda is great for that) the possibilities are endless.  The biggest improvement I've seen so far is with the feel of the guns. It really feels like a shooter now, much more so then Fallout 3 or New Vegas ever did. From the accuracy to the recoil etc it just feels so much more responsive and like a true FPS. Hard to describe but vastly improved over Fallout3.  The biggest problem I've had so far is with the UI for the settlements. Having some kind of display for which settlers are assigned to what task, the ability to name them etc would be fantastic. The existing system is a little clunky.  End Result? If you love the Fallout universe and lore, and like shooting raiders you won't be disappointed, and when the mod tools are released all of the little imperfections and annoyances will likely disappear.… Expand "

And all of these points still stand. But why the 7/10 then? Well, for a open world exploring game/ sandbox it's still a 9/10, but for a RPG it's just a 4/10. Why? Well, I would pin it down to two words: dialogue and decisions Wait, didn't I just said the dialogue was organic in the sense of good? Well, the dialogue is acutally now halfway entertaining to watch/listen, the cinematic camera does a really good job at that, compared to FO3's and NV's static system with a silent protagonist. The problem though is the actual content of the dialogue, including the limitation of only 4 options of what to say. Because in the content of what your character can say lies point 2: The decisions. Can you be a nice guy? Yes. Can you be a sarcastic nice guy? Yes. Can you be a greedy sarcastic nice guy? Yes. Can you be evil or anything else? No. No options for beeing ""evil"", no alternative solutions for quests (for example, maybe not just kill these raiders but tell them to go somewhere else?), using your SPECIAL stats or perks to find solutions like these? Nope, a few half-baked ""speech checks"" which are percentage based, so you can reaload the game tilli t works, and all they give is more caps (hence the ""greedy sarcastic guy"" thing). But that's basically it in the sense of roleplaying. You can't be very much someone else then whot he game wants you to be. Also there are way too many essential (unkillable) NPCs which also reduces my possible decisions. Oh, and let me make a comparison to NV: In NV, there was the Brootherhood of Stell in a bunker. Someone may later give you the quest to take them out or make peace with them (you can decide). But you can simply kill them all and blow up the bunker or become their ally without the quest. In FO4, there is also the Brootherhood of Steel. They have an airship. You can kill everyone on the airship, yes, but you can't bring it down. You need to get to the quest which demands you to. And you also can't be allied with them/irgnore them unlike you help them (or you side with the MInute Men, but then again you aree not allowed to destryo the airship), then you have to destroy all the other factions though. See the problem? Fallout 4 is a good exploration game and a piss poor RPG.… Expand "

As for the newer mechanics; I found some of them to be a clever idea, but not entirely memorable, such as the house building. To conclude, I had fun with this game, it didn't feel entirely like a Fallout game; but it's much better than rehashing the same old product, and selling it for 60$.

I've heard complaints of stuttering, poor graphics, and a small map but I don't see the merit behind those comments. It runs very smoothly in my experience, besides the occasional loss of a few frames in the dense downtown areas but with dozens of buildings and enemies in combat it's unsurprising. I still have much of the map to explore, it's bigger than it seems by looking at the map on the Pip-Boy. Though it may not take an incredible length to walk from end to end there are hundreds of locations with all unique designs and hundreds of collectibles scattered among them. The combat is far better than in the previous Fallout games, it feels much more responsive and realistic. I really enjoy the new legendary loot system, it encouraged me to increase the gameplay difficulty for an increase in loot spawns and it's made the game a bit more challenging and all around more enjoyable. I can already imagine myself replaying this game with differently built characters. The amount of possibilities in how you approach combat, missions, and conversations is immense and leaves me considering how I'll do it the next time. The crafting of armor, weapons, and structures is a fantastic addition to the series and it really gives the player the desire to be a wasteland scavenger and inventor.

Starting with the graphics, which are pretty average tbh.  The game world feels empty, there are extremely few towns and for hours at the beginning of the game you won't find any npc to sell your loot to and when you do it's one of those roaming caravans and you can't sell much to it because you're not running around the wastes bent under the weight of the loot, so your loot will likely be in a container back at the base, and then you can't find the vendor anymore. And no, there are no carriages that take you to other towns, like in Skyrim.  The power armor...I don't see its purpose. You can't use all the time because it runs on batteries which are pretty rare, so you can only fire it up when you have a hard combat zone to get through. Hell, if it was permanent, it would have made all other armors in the game pointless anyway.  Stealth gameplay appears to be very frustrating as even with high agility mobs can still easily detect you. Add to this the fact that many areas are FILLED with mobs, such as ghouls, that pile up on you once discovered. Add to this the fact that the game world is teeming with hostiles and you can't really run from one threat without hitting another threat. Add to this the fact that you simply won't see most mobs until they jump you. Add to this the fact that ammo is pretty scarce and you can't use your best stuff on random dogs and ghouls or you will run out of ammo before you even reach that cave you need to quest in.  The UI and controls are horrid on the PC. However, they don't interfere in combat like those from, say, Witcher 3 which imo is unplayable with kb&mouse. Still, looting (why the hell do we need two separate keys for looting, one for looting a chest/corpse and one for looting stuff off the ground?) and menu selecting are uncomfortable.  The story is meh, nothing mind blowing, just the regular cliches and stuff and could have been written by a 6th grader.

Lots of missions in this game, lots of activities. There's this unique settlement building detail added to this game that I have mixed feelings about. On one hand it adds an interesting new dimension to the game, kind of like a component of strategy games like how in Starcraft where you set up a base and gather up all the resources and build stuff (that tiny tidbit is where similarity ends). On the downside, settlement maintenance seems like a time-consuming distraction from everything else in the game. You do get minutemen support, but you can't do a lot with them; both artillery smoke grenades and flare guns are always out reach for minutemen support. I haven't run into any glaring bugs, just a few inconvenient design choices. Like, I wish I could do more with ""Home Plate"", like connect settlement resources to my own home out there or hold a Diamond City party. I'm having a hard time seeing some sort of ultimate goal, other than finding the protagonist's son--like maybe the search for a mega-G.E.C.K. that would turn the whole planet into a radiation-free Amazon jungle :) Nothing's perfect in this world, and this game is short of a 10.

As someone who values aesthetics, I particularly appreciate the advanced character creator.  Improvement could come in the form of having more complex quests that involve more than going somewhere and having to shoot things to reach something.  It would also be more engaging to have more independence- the situations sometimes feel like they'll have the same result regardless of what I say (and the vague dialogue options make it difficult to know what I will say anyway). When the narrative gets more intense such as (SPOILER) when I'm ordered to destroy Railroad, I'd like to have a few options to make it more engaging- Can I try to talk it through with them? Can I trick the Institute? Such options could still have tragic consequences but it'd be nice to have more narrative choices regardless. After all, a role playing game should be about the player's decisions.  (SPOILER) The thing that bothers me the most is the conclusion of the main quest. The narrative became dramatic when I entered the Institute, discovered its secrets and had to choose if I wanted to join it. The intensity increased (in my chosen plot path) when I discovered that Father was dying. After that, it was anti-climactic; there were no new revelations or twists. It was just a case of finishing off missions until Father died. Then he died and that was that.  Minor thoughts are that it'd be nice to have a bigger range of clothing and for locations to be more interesting (Diamond City is a village and wasteland buildings all hold the same things).  Aside from those points, I'm perfectly happy with it!… Expand "

In fact, if you look hard at it, it's pretty gutted. You automatically get in with every faction almost right at the start of the game. I suppose this is done in order to unlock more quests so you can level appropriately. It's more like Skyrim in game mechanics and execution than Fallout 3.  A mile wide, an inch deep.  This is not what Fallout gamers are used to, or wanting. Thus, the crazy low scores which are more rage than logic. This game's not a 0, or a 1, or a 2.  Other negatives:  It looks like the PC version was ported from console edition (it should be the other way around). The chat wheel is a freaking embarrassment alone.  The graphics are very pedestrian.  Certain SPECIALS are near pointless (perception, intelligence to a lesser extent), while others are borderline OP (Charisma).  No skills, just pick a perk every level. Blacksmithing is one of the lamest perks there is, as a melee combatant my crafting options are remarkably lame and limited. Even worse, I get a shiskebab only to found out it's grossly inferior to what I already have. What? Finally, a fair amount of bugs that Bethesda likely just said ""no worries, modders will fix the game for us"". Hey, unpaid labor? What's not to like.  Positives:  Combat is fun, reasonably challenging if you don't put it on easy mode. The companions are by and large cool, and you have many of them to choose from.  Crafting in the game is fun for the most part, but without console commands to give yourself resources, I don't see how you can possibly build up more than one or two settlements organically. It would take hundreds of hours to do so (I'm about 70 in). Exploring is still fun, it IS Fallout. I like what they did with the various factions of adversaries, even if how you react to them doesn't really matter.  In the end, it's still Fallout. I'm still quite addicted to it, I've come to grips with what it its and accepted it accordingly. I can't reconcile giving it any lower than an 8 based on the time I've spent on it, and honestly it's being penalized for not being the Fallout RPG I was expecting.  If they had kept the focus on RPG, it'd be 10/10.… Expand "

This is a seriously well crafted product with a big story and lots of innovation over previous Bethesda titles. It isn't perfect, but it will consume hours and hours of you time.  Now that I have defended it, I will briefly criticize its faults: 1) The fallout series needs a reboot. Drop the canon. It is getting more ridiculous with each release...and this does not, in my opinion, work as well as it once did. Pushing reality works better if there is some basis to push from. Make the game environment much more believable...and write it from the present perspective with a retro flavor. Then introduce your wonderful capacity for humor and intrigue. 2) Drop the terrible PIP boy graphics, bad functionality and interface. It's too important. Most gamers are not old enough to remember these graphical systems anyhow. Use a smart phone layout with LCD, simulated finger swipe, holograms and a whole suite of real next gen technologies then make it retro. 3) Commit to the new features ... - Base building was a brilliant feature that was really underdone ... third party mods were essential but it was still lacking. - Legendary creatures and weapons were totally underdeveloped. Screwed up game play. Personally, I think they are a just not a fit for this game (a Borderlands like feature), and would be better to DLC them properly for enthusiasts. - if you are adding characters with more depth (a la BioWare), do more...but this was not a bad evolution from earlier titles ... I just see the potential. 4) Know your setting and work within it. Steam engines, pocket watches, and water-cooled machine guns (the assault rifle) are not rooted in the fifties, but in earlier decades. There are many examples of these mismatches. 5) Will the next city also be un-nuked? I assume it will be New York. Really? After Armageddon and 200+ years, New York and other major cities would not exist at all. An incinerated pancake buried by erosion. Back to point one about believably.… Expand "

One of the most important elements for me is the gargantuan world space! The exploration of this world is exciting and intense. One of the biggest upgrades from previous Fallout games is that while in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, the large open world was noticeably empty. In Fallout 4 there's always a new area to explore, another ruin to scavenge, and another pack of ghouls, raiders or super mutants infesting them! Especially downtown Boston is done amazingly! Full of enemies, surprises, loot, and new stories! The player companions are another huge step forward from other Fallout games. They have extremely unique personalities, and greatly add to the game's immersive quality. While the RPG elements are not as over the top as in the past. It is quite easy to lose yourself adventuring in the Commonwealth!

Cons ~facial animation, some of the expression are down right silly, ive had emotional moments that didnt hit home because my guy looked like he hadnt tooken a **** for a month ~power armor, the time you get the armor is not the problem the first type you get sucks, you step on a landmine half your armor is gone. The main problem is the fusion core, the item you need to run the suit. These fusion cores can be found by the dozen in one place, not a dark cave lurking with deadly enemies but at a allies base. I was able to use the power armor pretty much the whole game. ~npcs, not enough unique npcs ~story isnt really for newcomers, to really make a meaningful decisions you must know the lore of fallout.

This game really shines where all Bethesda games do, the sandbox world is unparalleled.  I can't confirm, but I've heard in multiple places the game is equivalent to 30 square miles to explore.  It took me hours to get by the first few quests because I just ate up the scenery and soaked in the glory that is the post-apocalyptic wastes.  That being said, the voice acting is not the best and I really wish they hadn't changed the dialogue system from the previous games (had the chat been the same this would have been a 10/10).  All in all, this is a wonderful game with a ton to do, interesting stuff to find, and I highly recommend it!… Expand "
markb1166,"Jan  6, 2016",9, After ten hours in the game and being sidetracked continuously I can say I am enjoying Fallout 4 as much as did Fallout 3.  Haven't had any issues with glitches as yet but have two save files at the ready in case but loads to do to take up your time and a great game. 
LarixUthule,"Nov 17, 2015",10,"              This review contains spoilers, click expand to view.          I am truly enjoying this game - I have 47 hours into it at this point. The graphics are incredible, far and away much richer and detailed than any game I've ever played.  I am very pleased that I upgraded my memory to 32 GB and got an AMD R9 390 video card before 11/2.  I find the structure of the PERKS to be intuitive and flexible, allowing a more personal build for choice of play style. The companions are interesting, the interaction is much closer to natural, and being able to participate in conversations is pleasing.  I find the personal concerns and world-views of these companions to have much greater depth than previous Fallouts, and am not bored by this or their conversations.  Their approval or disapproval is immediate and while there is no karma score kept for viewing, you will know where you stand, and will want to be a better person.  It's Boston!  Now, I was stationed in Washington DC back in the early 70s (yes I am that old) - that made Fallout 3 very interesting, but the scale was nothing close to the real deal.  Las Vegas I visited once, after playing the game for 865 hours, and even felt compelled to visit Hoover Dam.  The scale of New Vegas? Well it was closer to the real deal.  But now, Fallout 4 - it's Boston!...Greater Boston (Boston and surrounding cities)!  Wandering along either bank of the Charles and being attacked by Feral Gouls, Mirelurks and Super Mutants is a special treat.  Familiar landmarks and place-names had me smiling away and eager to explore further, even running out to get my wife and show her the Bunker Hill Monument, The USS Constitution (and hysterical story line), and when I get to Salem, the equivalent of the Witch Museum.  I am not always been sticking to the main story line, most often I find myself wandering about and exploring, playing out a side quest when encountered.  I am parking all of my companions at one location and swapping them out when I need a specific set of skills.  Although I am currently madly in love with a female android and having a hard time letting go - it also helps that she kicks butt.  Sorry for those folks who do not seem to be enjoying this game. It borders on being a joy for me.  Once a day, I do get a game crash, but that just makes saving often a good idea. Such a complex and rich game has so many moving parts, there will be some issues, and I will happily accept some minor problems, that we all know will be resolved shortly, so I can have THIS MUCH FUN!

Story and Quests  The main plot didn’t really disappoint, mainly because I didn’t expect much of it. To me in the end it wasn’t half bad, I got what I expected. Most of the main story quest were good, it definitely had some memorable moments, difficult choices and the total length of the story wasn’t too bad. As for side content and quests, which were usually good but often hard to find. Radiant quests in Fallout 4 had a large role which annoyed many, including me. While ignoring radiant quest, you can easily get around 80hours of quality content out of Fallout 4. The highly criticised voiced protagonist and the new dialogue system didn’t bother me, which did undoubtedly pose problems. But to me they were welcome changes, which felt like taking one step back and two steps forward.  Gameplay  Gameplay probably features the biggest changes and improvements of the Fallout series. Improvements can be found from various aspects of the game, from combat, exploration, crafting and character building. Compared to Fallout 3, the combat is much more responsive, faster and dynamic. Enemy variation is amazing in Fallout 4 and it was often surprising to see new features and abilities added to already known enemy types. Crafting is one of the biggest and greatest part of Fallout 4. As soon I saw the new crafting system of Fallout 4 in E3, I knew it was gonna be great and sure wasn’t disappointed. With Automatron DLC you can also build your own robots, and go far as building your own kickass Sentry Bot. With the improved crafting looting and exploration became more important and rewarding. Junk rarity was also in great balance, I often found myself missing needed materials which then motivated me go out to explore the wasteland. With the new crafting system also came the settlement mode, which allowed players to create their own towns and settlements. To me the vanilla settlement mode was dull in many ways. Either way the settlement mode can a lot of fun with mods, allowing you to actually craft something genuine and incredible. The leveling and perk system was also redesigned. While there was nothing wrong with the previous system, the new system was a welcome change.  Atmosphere  With the improvement to the weather system and technical features, the gameworld became more immersive and atmospheric. In general the atmosphere in Fallout 4 is more subtle than in previous entries. Commonwealth felt much brighter and hopeful than the desolate Capital Wasteland or Mojave Desert. This is likely due to the more vibrant weathers. To improve immersion, Bethesda did a nice job of reducing the amount of loading screens. Abandoned towns now could be explored without having to struggle through the 5 second loading screen every now and then. Animations weren’t really mind blowing, but they certainly were better than in the previous games.  Visuals and Audio  I remember when the first reveal trailer was shown, many were critizising its graphics. In reality, to me at least the graphics look great. As I mentioned before, I upgraded my system, so I was able to enjoy Fallout 4 at full ultra-settings. Bethesda did a great job by making a much more vibrant weather system. Weather ranging from clear blue skies to the toxic radiation storms. Usage of shadows is bit weak though, as many of the gameworlds lights do not cast shadows. Also kudos to Nvidia for the implementation of volumetric light shafts, HBAO+ and Flex powered debris effect. Not much can be said about the audio except its good. Usage of ambient sounds was improved, gunshots sounded nice and beefy and generally the SFXs are great. Only complaint I have about the audio, is the poor usage of reverb. The new Creation engine has reverb parameters and profiles, yet Bethesda didn’t seem to take the advantage of it.  Cons and Pros  + Absolutely amazing art design and direction. Hands down the best one in the series. + A highly detailed and immersive gameworld + Fantastic crafting system + Improved and faster paced combat + Voiced protagonist + Wonderful soundtrack by Inon Zur + Hours upon hours of addictive gameplay.  - Weakened RPG elements. - Settlement building is far too clunky in vanilla which completely limits your creativity. - The vanilla Diamond City Radio got repetitive real quick. With only total of 37 songs from which 12 were recycled from Fallout 3. - Visual quality and performance ratio is quite bad.  Final Verdict  While Fallout 4 did sacrifice some of its predecessors RPG elements, it still turned out to be one of the best open-world shooter that I’ve played. Fallout did change for better or worse, but as for me, it’s still an Fallout game, and a damn good one.  Another fantastic Fallout game 9.3 - 9.7/10.0… Expand "

Anyway, from my point of view:  What I liked: + Major improvement on combat (enemies actually take cover, not charging and shoot while running like before). + Shooting is smoother and more fun. + Power Armour system is awesome. + Weapon modification is awesome. + Building settlement is cool. Really feels like I'm rebuilding the wasteland. + Several piece of armour is cool, reminds me of morrowind. + Each companion has their own interesting story and quest. + Exploring the wasteland is fun. + I haven't encountered major bug or glitches so far. No CTD either. It's a good thing for me. Sure there are minor issues like enemies stuck in the wall but that's not a major issue.  What I'm not sure whether to like or dislike: ? I like the new real-time conversation system, but the response I get to choose is kinda meh. Limited to only 4 options. ? Removal of skill and integrate it to S.P.E.C.I.A.L and perks. ? Graphic is not really fancy, but personally I think it's still acceptable. ? Animation is not really smooth. ? Voiced protagonist. Often the problem on game with voiced protagonist is, they said things that I was not meant to say. ? I thought the world will be truly open, but there are still interior cells. I guess it's still not possible for that to happen with current Engine.  What I disliked: - No Hardcore mode like in New Vegas (perhaps the survival update will make it happen). - The Prologue is too rushed. - Weapons came out of nowhere. No longer you can see weapons holstered. It's just magically appear :D - So far, I haven't see special dialogue that checks our perks/ skill (since skill is gone). - No Companion Wheel :( - Should've use New Vegas Companion system where you're limited to only use 1 non-human companion and 1 human companion instead of limit all to 1 companion (But mod will fix it soon). - Romance system is kinda meh. - Too few side quest (compared to TES V side quest). - Long loading times (fixed it by turning vsync off) - Story, The way Bethesda design the choices and consequences of faction sometimes doesn't make sense to me.… Expand "

One of my favourite things in the game, or any game actually, was making the choice to save or kill one of my companions.  Without giving too much away, they found out something about themselves which they felt they could no longer live with. My character had begun to be romantically involved with them, but when confronted this character asked me to kill them, arguing that they could no longer be trusted.  I'm not normally one for role-playing a character a certain way that doesn't feel natural to me, but after I had killed my companion, I felt really guilty, and even angry at the ones who asked me to do so, but I did not reload and not kill them - instead I kept playing it out.  I did not take revenge on those who gave the order, I had decided to kill the companion and took the blame myself. My character became a dog of war, blindly following orders and killing old allies as if nothing in the world really mattered anymore, because it genuinely felt like it didn't.

The problem is that the game gives you the veneer of choice but then denies you any true storytelling elements.  As most reviewers have noted, the world is huge and the game is relatively fun.  The quests seem unrelated and meander a lot.  You'll find yourself wandering across a barren landscape, performing arguably the same quest over and over ad infinitum: Shooting, looting.  The combat system is pretty good--better than in the Elder Scrolls games at least.  But the quest system is worse.  The crafting system is okay: It's a little overwhelming and dependent on you carrying tons of objects.  The settlements seem like a pointless distraction. Since Oblivion, Bethesda has been driven by this idea of providing a bigger and bigger world, as though that's what players truly want.  What Skyrim and New Vegas and Fallout 4 don't seem to realize, though, is that gamers don't want a bigger world, we want a world in which our characters have an impact in shaping.  Oblivion was redeemed by a Main Quest that was actually pretty solid.  Skyrim's sheer beauty helped compensate for a completely limp storyline.  Fallout 4 is a good game in Bethesda's pantheon, but it lacks the intimacy of Oblivion and the epic quality of Skyrim.  For the first few hours, you'll have a blast scavenging nuclear irradiated rivers and sniping Super Mutants from afar.  But then the fetch quests start.  The Brotherhood of Steel even has two infinitely recycling fetch quests, which undermines the sense of meaning in the world.  Soon, after you've spent hours building settlements that do nothing and interacting with people in meaningless exchanges, you realize the biggest problem of Fallout is its purported strength.  It is too open.  Bethesda wants to give you so much that none of it really matters.  One of the reasons I was so engrossed in BioShock was because they realized that, in order to drive home a powerful and emotionally eviscerating story, you sometimes have to eschew choice.  Bethesda gives us mountains and mountains of inconsequential moments.  By the time you've slapped around the fiftieth iteration of the same enemy, by the time you've cleared the same version of a similar raider-infested hideout, you get tired and bored and--what's worst--uninvested in the game.  But that doesn't mean it's not fun.  It is.  And it's a brilliant game.  It just doesn't connect emotionally or resonate on anything other than an aesthetic level, which is a hard bullet to bite from Bethesda.… Expand "

Killing enemies is extremely satisfying. The only issue lies in the game's difficulty- or lack thereof. While the game has no level limit, and tons of character build potential, your character becomes so easily overpowered at level 30ish that it lacks any clear and necessary strategy. A few bugs also plague gameplay, and makes some situations irritating.  Story is terrible. While some missions are fun, a few quest lines can make you laugh, the overall plot is laughable and poorly done. Bethesda is known for good story, and this isn't it. Endings are, in all, terrible.  Building is amazing. Clipping issues are irritating, and it's clearly a skeleton for future updates, but it's a great new feature.  Crafting is nice- but at the cost of little to no unique weapons. Legendary item system is poorly done.  Graphics are FINE. People are forgetting how long this game has been in production. To top it off, the level design makes crappy graphics totally acceptable.

The game is a fusion of RPG and FPS, but it's not an old school style RPG, nor is it a twitchy FPS. This is the best open world sandbox game I have ever seen. This is a game for explorers and builders. My advice is to turn off the quest markers and take one's time checking out the world, rather than trying to rush through the story line as fast as one can. One could compare this to a Skyrim with a better sandbox, or a Morrowind with better quests.  The combat is far superior to the prior titles, but it doesn't need a twitchy trigger finger to succeed. The VATS system is now slow motion, instead of a time stopper that it was in Fallout 3. Bethesda has also doubled down on the crafting, which is optional for those that are not into that. The crafting includes chems, cooking, modding weapons, armor, and power armor, and even building your own network of settlements and caravans. Player freedom is everywhere in the game.  Finally, the NPCs are superb. Nearly every NPC is unique, even those that are generically named ""Settler"" or ""Guard"". Even the raiders have personalities. The companions are the best in the series, with wonderful voice acting, and most with extensive backstories. They are no longer slavish followers, but have their own likes and dislikes. The player character is also voice acted, and while this may dismay some users preferring older style games, the acting is superb and does not detract from the roleplaying.

It's reasonably pretty, especially outdoors, without terribly noticeable pop-in.  Combat mechanics are great, especially with guns. Nick is a great companion.  Some of the map is very nice, unique and often beautiful.  The game has weather, often spectacularly, and while there are radiation storms and radioactive zones, Bethesda has finally figured out that radioactivity is not making everything green.  There is some humor, and plenty of interesting little side stories told in notes and on CRTs.  Weapon crafting is decent, although a dearth of pre-war military and civilian weapons makes zero sense in a world full of perfectly edible pre-war food.  Settlement building is nice for those who like it, although it's often crippled by arbitrary limits and most of the pieces don't snap together.  Factions are reasonably varied (four) and are not completely caricatures.  Now the bad.  Enemy AI is pretty bad for a 2015 game, and companion AI is ludicrously bad.  The role playing aspects have been dumbed down to the point of being largely useless, little more than yes/no/sarcasm/huh? buttons, and often what your character says is not what you expect since the choices, to accommodate consoles, are just short summaries.  Bethesda's work on character models, textures and animations are still far behind the best of the modders, much less the AAA competition.  Guns are not well thought out (26 pound 5.56mm assault rifles) although they do function well.  The settlement crafting is crude and often the arbitrary limits make no sense - why am I jury rigging housing when just beyond the glowing green line are perfectly good buildings and houses?  Why am I making a settlement on a tiny mud island in the middle of a swamp?  The map is way too small, so antagonistic groups live virtually on top of that be another, with zero thought given to how they eat, and firefights often become three-way affairs.  The voice acting for the player is supposed to allow emotion, but that is hardly used.  Companions have far too little dialog for the programmed amount of chatter.  Many of the side quests are extremely repetitive.  And the main quest is, um, not very inspiring.  Overall I like it a lot, but I had hoped for more.  However, the revised engine is decent and we are promised a G.E.C.K. So Bethesda's biggest strength, its unmatched modder support, will eventually allow us to tailor the game to our individual preference.  In the mean time, it's a pretty good game out of the box.  Just be aware that it is more an atmospheric shooter than an RPG.… Expand "

Overall improvement in terms of graphics, combat.. but.... there are some other downsides besides the small improvements or lack of innovation.  - Story not as good as New Vegas (better than FO3) - Followers are uninteresting compared to NV. - Boring factions - No slavers (hope it's not because Bethesda is aiming at younger audience under 18) - Lack of adult contents like the ones you see in NV (Kids mustn't see these..... or Bethesda afraid of backlash?) - Lack of epic moments like blowing up Megaton or stopping Mr Burke in FO3 - The towns and societies in FO4 seem to lack soul. It's not like that feeling you get when you visit Megaton, Rivet City or Tenpenny Tower which gives you a weird feeling. - Side stories are uninteresting. - Aimed at casuals. No more using stealth play like sneaking in the casino in NV to rescue the kidnapped guy. Now it's just sent to a location, clear the place of bad guys. And that's it. - No major decision making. Or lack of them cause apparently (to Bethesda) gamers are dumber these days. - It's no longer an rpg with action play. It's now an FPS action game with rpg elements. =( Sad to see this. Hope Bethesda won't do this for the next Elder Scrolls. - Season Pass BS. Paying upfront without knowing what you gonna get.... Hmm... Not you too Bethesda.

If you are hoping for a vastly improved experience....meh, not so much.  The good: -The graphics continue to be very good. Not amazing or game-changing, but very very good. -The gameplay is simple and familiar to those who have played Fallout 3 or Fallout:New Vegas, making the transition easy. -There are endless little side quests, mission, and characters that make the game have enough depth to warrant the price.  The bad: -The storyline is pretty boring and not particularly compelling. -The 3 main Factions that make up the game are interesting, yet their storylines and the choice you make as part of a faction don't tend to make a lot of sense. Granted, it is may be a little refreshing that there are no clear good/evil sides, but the factions are so morally ambigious that you tend to not care about their causes, either. -The missions, especially when it comes to settlements, are often boring and repetitive. -There still is not a great variety of ways to solve problems, so you are invariably going to end up with some sort of gun in a firefight with a bunch of raiders/supermutants/bad guys, and it always plays out in pretty much the same way. Opportunities to do things like sneak, or hack computers and turn the turrets against the unaware guards, are few and far between.  Overall, it's a good game worth playing. And as I mentioned, if you liked Fallout3 and New Vegas, you will like Fallout 4. But it falls short of being some sort of truly amazing, game of the year game, and in the end is just pretty good.… Expand "

After 50 hours of playing, I can say that Fallout 4 has SUPERIOR gunplay, settlement building (really nice), streamlined perks and skills compared to Fallout 3, but it has INFERIOR story, dialogue (truly horrible), very small map, companions feel fake, loads and loads of fake choices, and everything feels procedurally generated with little hand-crafted love in many of its dungeons, bosses and other locations. The apocalypse has never been so colorful and hand-holding, populated and theme-park-like as it is with Fallout 4. In fact, it feels like a FAKE apocalypse took place and everybody is a poor actor at it. There is no shortage of resources, people, enemies, items and other things. You'd think that after the apocalypse, all production of most goods would have ceased, but here, you'll be swimming in them. You can't have these many items around as everybody alive on the surface since the apocalypse would have already scavenged everything useful and edible from these ruins! You'd be annoyed that you have so many items and not enough vendors with enough caps to sell them to. Fallout 4 is a very addictive game, I find myself playing it a lot, but this is not always a good thing as good dialogue and story were sacrificed for good gameplay. Addictive games are a trend in mobile (at the expense of story), but they shouldn't be the be-all end-all in PC and console games where there is always room for a good story. It shouldn't be this way and that both things can coexist in the same space. This is unacceptable coming from a AAA publisher like Bethesda. I am so thankful that I didn't pre-order this and bought it on a Steam Sale. Overall, it's still a good game (and great if you can mod it to the high-heavens like I did) but with everything that I saw here, I am VERY worried for Elder Scrolls VI. If the next Elder Scrolls has this poor dialogue, story and fake-feeling companions and characters, I'd rage at Bethesda. Overall, I'm disappointed at Bethesda for wasting Fallout 4 with its poor decisions and excessive shortcuts.… Expand "

The companion system is absolutely terrible and laughable.

I enjoy developing my settlement in between missions but feel this was added to hide what is basically Fallout 3.  I'm not into keeping settlers happy so I've only built a decent gaff for myself, I've been frozen for 200 years after all.  The 'looking for my kidnapped son' quest was interesting until I killed the kidnapper.  He might be dead, if not he'll be fine as I've got my own life to sort out.

As well as the new mod system is one of my favorite aspects customizing weapons was and still a blast., now you can't make weapons, but that makes since, it is a post nuclear wasteland, weapons would not be made as easily compared to before the war. Another thing I wanted to address is the shooting. Some people say the shooting mechanics are terrible, and to that I say this, the gun mechanics in this game can be viewed in  2 ways: 1. it is immersive, now hold your horses keyboard warriors hear me out, in a post-nuclear wasteland these guns may not have been cared for in years on end, they were probably banged up after being through a nuclear explosion, despite popular belief guns are as fragile as when they were first invented, I'm talking about the insides not outside, if a gun is roughed up enough the accuracy and ability are dropped significantly. 2. The devs dropped the ball; I can see how some people would believe this though I don't think this is true. So vats is a big debate right now should it have been kept in stop time mode or has the transition into slow-mo become a good thing, again on this note it is up to the player to decide. People who want a more realistic and adrenaline run game think it's a good idea, but someone who wants a simple game may prefer the frozen time version, it all comes down to preference. Voice-Acting has been a heated debate in my opinion when I first heard that it was going to be voice acted, I was a little worried and even angry, but the voice actors did a fantastic job and did not let me down.

Fallout 4 is a really good game, plagued by issues that detract some from the experience.  The well -packaged world and its big heaps of content plus a large mod base make this game a very attractive candidate to sink many hours into. The graphics don't set my world alight but they certainly aren't the boon people make them out to be. If you don't like them now wait a few months,or even weeks, and you will have a plethora of mods to improve and tweak them to your liking. The keyboard and mouse controls are sketchy at times, and have always been questionable in Bethesda titles. I would use a controller. IMO a controller with full support is very comfortable in these games, especially for the long sessions, and very little is left to be desired in the speed and accuracy department as it isn't a fast paced, competitive game. I don't like the conversation setup, where it doesn't show you what you are saying next, but there is already a mod to correct that (which I highly recommend). The opening is top notch, and the main story line is more immersive than I expected, but it certainly isn't the strong point of the game. The volume of quests and things to do/explore in this game are what really entice me. the world begs to be explored, and challenges you when you foray into the unknown. It is woefully unforgiving at higher difficulty settings. So unless your the type with 300 hours logged into dark souls games id stick to good old normal. If you haven't enjoyed previous Bethesda titles, then this game isn't for you. But for those who are new to Bethesda or even fans, my suggestion to most is to wait a few months til it drops in price (or catch the eventual steam sale) and/or some bugs and optimization issues have been corrected. If you can look past the occasional dip to 30 fps or so and some of the quirks we all know are prominent, then buy it now.

Im going to say this right off the bat i love the fallout series and with a burning passion i literally counted the days until fallout 4 and i enjoyed the game i definitely got my money's worth out of it and then some but when i started to play it what i got wasn't a fallout game hell it wasn't even a Bethesda game this game feels plays and looks like a 2nd party developer made this and tried to get innovative but for the most part they struck out especially with the voice acting so ill get started with that with my first character i started off as a young long haired mel Gibsonish character and the voice matched pretty well to the character i built but that was the only character the voice matched to after i completed the game i created a character who was an old chiseled Asian character who was a master at silent killing and took **** from no one but the character sounded like a 25 year old guy who just came out of college and it just ruined the feel for me so i had to give up on the character also with the voice acting/voice wheel you can't choose your exact words and its usually a guessing game on what you say and how the characters will react which also help ruin the RPG feeling also with the voice acting you only had for choices for everything so that also limited the amount of things i could say and it just felt like bethesda was ripping of the Mass Effect dialogue system which is more of an interactive story like telltale's games than a hallmark RPG youre used to also the perk system is crap immediately right off the bat you have to choose what kind of build you want your character to begin with and if you want to change that after leaving the vault then you have to grind for a long time to change what you want your character to be instead of Skyrim and Fallout 3 starting you off basically as the same character for everyone and as you progress your charcter seems more like the person you want it to be also skill points are gone and it is just perks which you can only select a certain perk if you have enough of any of the S.P.E.C.I.A.L which is annoying because each effect a certain part in combat stength is damage and carry weight perception accuracy endurance health charisma..... nothing intelligence amount of experience points agility AP (your stamina bar) and Luck your critcal hit chance which fallout was already like this but its way more noticable if your character is unbalanced as for the graphics they are not the best but they are not the worst it is definatly a step up from fallout 3 and Skyrim vanilla but with my mods on skyrim Skyrim looks 10 times better than fallout 4 does so if a bunch of nerds with to much time on their hands doing stuff for free can top one of americas best gaming publishers in terms of graphics then thats just sad also i would like to ad on that just because i am **** doesnt mean i don't like the game the combat mechanism is excellent and so is the crafting and building system oh the story the story is stale and copy and paste with all but one of the 4 endings i would also like to ad that the basis for the story is stale and starts off with you trying to find your son.. you know because you like love him or something which is something that a lot of gamers can't personally relate to because most aren't mothers and fathers i can almost certainly garentee that unlike fallout 3 and NV where chances are you had a loved one taking care of you and if they left you'd want to find out why and NV where if you got shot in the head youd track that fcker down and kill him... or befriend him whatever suits you aside from the story the lore is great but as an overall bethesda game this does not level with the groundbreaking games that they have made so i am giving it 6/10… Expand

Kohlins,"Jan  4, 2016",8," After reading many of the reviews here it's hard to say anything that hasn't been said already and it seems that players either love or hate this game and either give it a ridiculously low or high score, none of which it should deserve. First of all, I want to emphasize that it is not a bad game, I spent quite a lot of time with it and pretty much enjoyed it, but I was still disappointedAfter reading many of the reviews here it's hard to say anything that hasn't been said already and it seems that players either love or hate this game and either give it a ridiculously low or high score, none of which it should deserve. First of all, I want to emphasize that it is not a bad game, I spent quite a lot of time with it and pretty much enjoyed it, but I was still disappointed in the end. I simply expected more of such a title.  The game provides a really good atmosphere. The post-apocalyptic world of Boston is truly fascinating, full of small details and easter eggs worth exploring. I found myself spending far more time exploring the world than doing quests and yet, after watching Youtube videos I had to realize how deep the content is and how many things I simply hadn't noticed. I think the combat has improved since Fallout 3. VATS is still fun and provides many bonuses, but no longer absolutely necessary to use. Aiming in general is much easier but it also means that is no longer that dependent on character abilities, you can easily headshot every opponent with any sort of character. The enemies disappointed me a bit, as there's no real variety, especially if you already know the series. You'll be fighting pretty much the same raiders, super mutants, animals, feral ghouls and robots you've already encountered in the previous games with synths being the only main exception. Sure there are variants of each type, but still gets boring pretty soon. I also have to mention that the AI is quite bad with many opponents getting stuck. There aren't many weapons in the game as well, although they can be modified which is a nice new feature compared to previous Fallout games.  The graphics were... fine. That's the correct word for that. Nothing spectacular, but as a fan of the series I couldn't care less. Yet it could disappoint some people. Certain things look nice, and it's more colourful than the third game. However the character animations, especially the facial expressions during dialogues are just horrible. As if the developers didn't care about it, it's just not synchronized with the audio. Speaking of the audio, I liked the voice acting, think it's better compared to the previous games and we also have a voiced protagonist here. The radio stations were fine but not as enjoyable as in Fallout 3. The DJ was quite the opposite of Three Dog, yet the music was almost the same with very few new tracks. Couldn't the developers find anything new from that era or what?  Now a few words about the role-playing aspects of the game. As if the developers forgot that Fallout is indeed an RPG where you can shoot guns and not an action game with some RPG elements. Those who expect it to be an FPS-like game will be disappointed because combat (although improved) doesn't match that of a real action game. Those who expect an RPG will also be disappointed because of the really simplified RPG elements. It's a simplified hybrid that exceed neither as an FPS or RPG. The main story starts promising but in the end it turns out to be nothing more than a simple faction war with few possible choices. The writing is bad, you have very few dialogue options and your responses don't seem to alter the story. This is not acceptable for an RPG I think. I also didn't like the ending. I don't want to add spoilers, but don't quite understand why a faction which wants to preserve technology would destroy something more advanced in such a post-apocalyptic scenario. It's just not logical to me among many other things.  The skill system is gone, every time you level up, you simply gain one perk point which adds a certain bonus (such as the ability to pick more advanced locks). The perk tree is interesting at first, but the character development is way too simplified in my opinion. Those who liked Fallout, pretty much liked it because of its character customization, you had to plan your build. Here your levelling is not limited, the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats can be improved as perks, so theoretically you can have everything useful unlocked with a single character. Way too bad for an RPG. Seriously. As I mentioned before the main attributes don't affect much of the gameplay neither, you can shoot as accurate as you want even with low perception for instance, the latter only affects accuracy in VATS.  Settlements are a completely new feature of the game. I guess they realized how successful Minecraft was and simply wanted to add something similar where players can use their creativity and build anything they can imagine. Or at least that was the idea. Fortunately, the game doesn't force you to use it, it's just a bonus and can be fun, but it's not a revolutionary change.  Besides all the errors, Fallout 4 is a good game and really enjoyable. Yet it has serious faults and I haven't even mentioned its bugs, many of which are quite annoying, though I have to admit that some are funny as hell. Good, but definitely not the game of the year as expected.… Expand "

(Having played all Bethesda games I know they are like good wines: they take some ripening before they are best consumed and player mods are the cheese in that analogy).  Impression so far: A very happy surprise :)  • Graphics: Amazing and way better than expected. The folks responsible for the world design and all that's in it deserve statues. On random hikes through the wasteland I find myself stopping all the time to look around and appreciate the vistas and rich, immersive detail. From cities to the back country: jaw dropping gorgeous. Also the vintage style artwork is better than ever.  • Combat: best combat in Fallout games so far. Much more smooth and action packed compared to previous titles. More interesting monsters and the implementation of Power Armor is awesome.  • Open world content & quests: Though the quests seem less fleshed out compared with the excellent writing and immersion of FO : New Vegas, (Obsidian did a great job there), the world feels less linear and is more open and filled to the brim with content. A staggering amount of content.  The main story line doesn't interest me so much: I think that's a mistake from Bethesda: shoehorning you into a very specific back-story in such an open, free game world. I prefer an 'anonymous prisoner' start, where players are able to immersive themselves in backgrounds of their own imagining. At least I haven't encountered birth-marks and 'you are the chose one' clichés so far. Although various factions do act like you are god-sent. I am not bothered with my character having a voice, by the way.  • Settlement building & crafting: I am in love with the modification system and settlement building. It's a great, rich addition to the core gameplay and makes living in the wasteland much more immersive and compelling. Can't wait for the survival mode to make this game the ultimate post-apocalypse sim.  • Polish: Probably the most polished Bethesda game yet. Haven't encountered bugs so far. Some mechanics feel a little quirky and your dog companion tends to stand in your way (much like real dogs), but no game breaking stuff yet. The dog is easily replaced later on. They could improve a little on the settlement mechanics and explanations perhaps.  All in all: very happily surprised with a much more fleshed out, beautiful and compelling game than I expected and completely in awe with the world design. 9/10… Expand "

It's full of memorable locations, and overflowing with the dark humor well known in the Fallout universe. The combat is fantastic, with both melee and gunplay very smooth and enjoyable. The voiced acting is new, and uncomfortable for many, yet can add to the immersive experience with a bit of imagination. The story is quite good and well thought out. It's concepts have been done before, but not to this extent, with as many options, or in a Fallout game. Plus the crafting, while rudimentary, is brilliant. The bugs are minimal for a Bethesda open-world rpg, though some do crop up.  Cons: The conversation wheel is lacking in choice, and when an option is chosen, it can take you by surprise what is said. The persistence of the same quests. While a great way to earn xp, they get old quick. Lack of a F:NV hardcore mode was disappointing aspect for many, including myself.  Overall, this game is a must play. It continues to hit home the ""looking to the future"" aspect. Sure it has it's problems, but we as gamers must be objective. Is this game better than Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas? Not by a long shot. Are those games better than this iteration? No. This game brings change, for better or worse. People hate change, just look at some of the other reviews. I cannot wait to see what the future holds for this game, and the franchise as a whole.  Enjoy!… Expand "

Очень хорошо: радиация и броня. 1 -- наконец-то радиация опасна. Теперь радиация основательно жрет хп и это шикарно. А броня.. Чтож, броня очень крутая. Изменение интерфейса, акцент на ""передвижном танке"", возможность апгрейда -- все круто. С балансом проблемы правда. Лекарств все также слишком много, еды тоже, воды тоже, а ядерные батареи для брони везде прям есть. Это все убивает необходимость крафтинга этих вещей и вообще облегчает игру.

So let's start the review.  First the good.  The /good/ quests the game offers are great.   While most are linear (more on that later) , they are made interesting via the locations they are set or the events happening.  And when they actually decide to give you some choice, they /really/ shine.  As someone who has a been playing role-playing games since the early 90's, quests like ""Last Voyage of the U.S.S. Constitution"", ""Human Error"", and even ""Reunions"" are some of the most memorable.  Bethesda actually handled moral choices /brilliantly/.  This might be a controversial one, since a lot of people seem to be convinced you're stuck playing a good guy all the time but that's the real wonder of it.  Gone are the clear cut good and evil choices that most role-playing games have.  Instead, almost ever choice seems to be some shade of grey.  While, yes, its true Fallout 4 doesn't allow you to be as big of a monster as you could have been in previous games its equally impossible to be the big damn hero and savior of the wasteland.  And as far as I'm concerned, that's great.  And its especially shocking coming from Bethesda, a company whose never really been good at that.  The world is also well designed.   There a a lot of memorable locations, some great ambient dialogue if you take your time and listen, and unlike Fallout 3, things feel less random.  Everything goes together well.  Most characters are likable and well-written.  Some of them, such as Nick Valentine and Kellogg, are some of my favorite characters in the Fallout universe.   And the Brotherhood of Steel's portrayal in the game is a brilliant evolution the controversial portrayal in Fallout  3.  I was actually impressed and again, Bethesda has to do a lot to do that.  Now the bad.  Most of the quests are far to linear and violence is far to often the solution to everything.  The options to make peace, to solve a lot of quests without gunning everything down are gone.  This is especially disappointing in the endgame, when your choices lead to bloody results no matter what you do.   And while there are some genuinely great quests, the vast amount of running and gunning can overshadow it, especially to a more cynical mind.  The dialogue wheel is crap in almost every role-playing game and Fallout 4 is no exception.   The worst part of it is the inconsistency, especially with the ""sarcastic"" option.  And perhaps worst of all, there's quite a few points in the game where you feel like a great idea is wasted for more running and gunning... And so much more could have been done.  Over all, that's the real fault of Fallout 4.  It is a good game, with a lot of disappointing elements because while if feels more than complete... It also feels rushed.  Over all, I'd say its a 7.5 game.… Expand "

The following is a list of observations that I'll try to make as objective as possible.  Positives:  -Graphics & Sound. Like the aesthetic or not, the technology is superior to all previous vanilla Bethesda games. Some of the textures are lacking, and it is not as good as many other modern titles, but overall it is a step-up. The sounds, score, and music selections also are all solid.  -Updated (64bit/DX11) Game Engine. This alleviates many of the memory-related limitations of previous games (especially relevant to people who mod their game heavily).  -Improved Gameplay Elements. A robust weapon modding/crafting system, legendary items, unique power armor mechanics, smoother feeling gun-play than previous Fallout games, and a generally polished feel all around.  -Mod Support. This goes without saying for Bethesda games.  Neutral/Personal Opinions:  -Voiced Player Character. I personally don't like it, as it further removes the game from being an RPG in a traditional sense. None of the characters I can make in FO4 feel like my own, but instead feel like a version of the same guy/girl I made before with a mood swing. Having a voiced character also limits the feasibility of having a lot of dialogue options (see the ""Negatives""). That said, the voice acting itself is quite strong on average for what it's worth.  -Settlement Building. It feels like a rushed-out feature to me - it's very clunky,  limited, and relatively inconsequential. It's getting better with some of the DLC (and even more so with mods), but overall it still feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.  -Story. I feel it's weak, and predictable - additionally the premise is a rehash of Bethesda's last FO game, Fallout 3 (instead of ""find your father"", it's ""find your son""). The story has some good moments, and there are a few memorable side-quests, but overall it feels lacking to me compared to previous games.  -Perk System. I like it more than the arbitrary skill point numbers in previous Fallout personally, but there are still some areas of weakness. In an ideal perk system, I believe no one perk should feel mandatory - each perk should be interesting and provide its own unique benefits over taking other perks. In Fallout 4 it feels like you end up missing out on a LOT of the game if you don't take some crafting perks and at least one of Lockpicking and/or Hacking.  -Minigames (Lockpicking/Hacking). I dislike them, some people don't mind them or even like them. Personally when playing Fallout, I'd rather continue playing Fallout, rather than continuously being interrupted by some silly minigames.  Negatives:  -Dialogue System & Variety. Four vaguely worded responses is rarely, if ever, enough - this is even worse when the responses are oftentimes meaningless. The common joke is that the options are typically ""Yes"", ""No (Yes)"", ""What? (Yes)"", and ""Sarcastic (Yes)"" - sadly this is actually pretty accurate. It is somewhat the fault of having a voiced player character, as having more options would require more voice acting.  -Lack of Player Choice. As mentioned above, Bethesda seems to want you to do everything possible in the game in a single play-through. There is almost never an option to simply refuse a quest through dialogue. As a result, the game ends up feeling very railroaded and not much like an RPG.  -""Radiant"" Questing. +90% of the quests in the game feel like dynamically generated ""go here and [kill/collect] [raiders/super mutants/ghouls/an object]"" - even many of the main quest tasks feel this way. Sadly some of the most intriguing/interesting/impact-ful quest premises end up boiling down to this as well (thinking of the tasks surrounding a certain robot-oriented side-quest).  Conclusion:  It feels like Bethesda is trying to move away from the formula that made them so successful in the first place. While changes can often provide a breath of fresh air, making too many changes at once risks alienating the existing audience.  I'm sure that with more interesting mods I'll get my fair share of enjoyment out of this installation, but I really wish Bethesda had done some things differently.… Expand "

I did play Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, and it didn't struck me that much. Apart from the very awkward dialog wheel which doesn't properly present the dialog choices (it summarizes them in a few words), which means often you can't understand fully what the different options mean until you pick them. The settlement building is a really nice idea, sadly the building controls are really poor. The companion system is nice too, but the companions tend to get stuck, and when you park them in a large settlement good luck finding them (even worse, when you don't remember in which settlement you stored them, there's no quick way to find them - without using the console I mean).  All in all, it's a decent game with a large world and many quests and places to build stuff, but it gets repetitive and tedious. If you are a die-hard Fallout fan maybe you'll be disappointed, but if not, despite the bugs it's quite worth playing I think.… Expand "

The faces look weird in dialogue some of them looking even looking demonic plus the writing and voice acting isnt very good, I mean some of the delivery is just horrible , like the little girl that shouts with the Newspaper in Diamond City, might be the worst I've ever heard, its a nitpick but I expect more polish. Third person view is basically unplayable its very jagged jumpy and ugly especially when you are running. In the first person view there were many times where the frame rate would just go insane for about 10 seconds mostly during combat or explosions and I would have to put the controller down while the game spazzed out. Combat also kind of gets old and the A.I. partners are terrible. Too many times I looked around and they were miles away, too many times they stood by in a fire fight while I got swarmed by enemies while they fired maybe 3 shots and hid in a room. The game is also void of any real weight nothing you do really feels impactful and I thought that was pretty disappointing. There is also two major bugs in the game that infuriated me. One the map would send you across the map to incorrect mission locations and for someone that just started playing and cant fast travel everywhere thats a big waste of time. Second one is there's a mission where you must take back the old minutemen castle, to use as a central base from these crab creatures and its a pretty difficult for me at least and it took a little while to complete then at the end the game tells you to ""Meet the minutemen in the courtyard, only the guy you need to talk to Garvey isn't there. So I wasted about 15 minutes wondering around the castle destroying egg nests (which no matter how many you destroy the objective doesnt get completed another bug) until I saw far away o my map, the original objective marker, so I went to it and its Garvey running on a loop yelling about taking back the castle (which we already did) and fixing the radio (not even in the mission). And so i talked to him and... nothing he just kept running, so the mission I took the time to complete was for nothing because of a stupid **** bug. I rambled but thats a damn shame that a developer cant even keep major mission and story altering bugs out of the final product. This was an okay rental but i'd be mad if I spent full price on this.… Expand "

The only way to fix this is to reload a previous save, thus forcing you to redo things you have already done.  This, and I grant that it is a big flaw, does not prevent this from being a landmark game in this genre. Now a days every developer is so infatuated with the idea of multi player. Bethesda has not yet infected their games with an online multi-player.... yet.  Fallout is huge, expansive, immersive and one hell of a lot of fun to play. It is challenging without being to easy and not being to difficult. Get overly cocky or careless and that rad scorpion will kick your ass. Walk in guns blazing to a group of super mutants... and they will put you down. Enemies are diverse and some are creepy as hell.

Bethesda repeats their same mistakes again and again and players are finally sick of it.  STORY:  7/10.  This game story has a great set-up but not a great executions.  It is the same old same old look for family member.  Discover the world.  The bad side is your forced to be a good guy and do not have so much freedom.  If you not good your companions will leave you.  I feel disconnected from my character because the dialogue options are so limited and ambitious.  You never know what you are really saying OR the context the speech will be said in.  For example, in 2 different conversations “Put your gun down,” is an option.  In one conversation, it is a peaceful request and in a different request you say it as a threatening demand.  Because of this the dialogue is dumb-ed which is unacceptable for a game that supposed to be heavily engrained in story.  Every interaction has been downgraded and limited.  The building options in the game are absolutely unacceptable mess due to their poorly developed mechanics and limitations in the quality & quantity of what you can build.  You are not given very many options in terms of what you want to build and how you build it.  You might want a 2 story house but you have to manipulate the system do it.  The building materials you need for corners are not included making finishing touches impossible.  To top that off… the roof pieces do not always fit that well if you build outside of a boxed structure. Building is a jumbled mess… some pieces just do not snap into place when they should.  You literally have to fight to get some pieces snap into place the way you want it to function if you need stairs to face a certain way.  There are too many building sites in this game so building becomes a terrible chore you are forced to do and you will hate that you could not build what you want to because the limited options.  You are limited to 1 type of store look instead of building dedicated buildings.  The face that you are limited to your first person view is unacceptable.  They should have made it so that it felt like an out of body experiences where you can float in mid air.  If enemies are killed at your site their bodies will pollute that site forever (unless you use console commands).  Bethesda NEVER learns from their mistakes.  Their menu is the same jumbled unorganized mess it always will be. Weapons are renamed based on their upgrades making selling them a horrible headack because even a crappy pipe-gun is given so many names you have to look at everything closely to know what it is.  I cannot express my hate for the menus enough.  Balancing problems make it so enemies are too easy OR too hard.  I feel like I want a lot more strategy in these types of games.  Same repetitive game play as always.  I LOVED the fully voiced characters companions with their own unique stories that are very interesting and I LOVE Valentine.  The fully voiced world and complains except for the one strongly associated with the Minutemen who sounds terrible.  The downside is that Bethesda followers have this problem with saying the same 3 things over and over and over like always.  I love how they each have ONE unique comment for specific areas when you explore and they have some interesting conversations with other NPC which is AMAZING.  They would be so much better if the conversations were not so superficial.   I feel like Unique conversations and hope that future Bethesda games will expand on this.  If you have companions then make them unique and write them to say something different.  Speaking of positive changes… when your complain blocks your movement… THEY GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.  THIS IS A MIRICAL… no longer will you have to hit them to get out of your way… most of the time they will just move out of your way!!!… Expand "

The chances to raise some villages, build your own structures, etc, makes you feel you are evolving the world that surrounds you. The 4 main factions of the game are quite good, even more if you choose railroad. The graphics are accurate to the year of releasing. The customization of weapons, the perks and the game system is quite similar to other Fallout games, maybe with more Action.  And, if you choose hard mode, with some survival aspects, game turns even more interesting. Adding some mods to it will make the game very inmersive.

The concept of the game is great and I really enjoyed exploring the world, upgrading tech and shooting things, however a few vital things have been overlooked.  Playing this game felt like a beta. There are so many graphical glitches, quest completion bugs, characters getting stuck in objects, perspective view glitches, textures missing. Come on, this isn't amateur hour, you should expect to be able to play a game to completion with none of this.  A fundamental flaw is the combat mechanics. Although the blocking system works well with melee attacks, the cover system is far below par when you can't even hide behind cover or walls or interact with the world around you to help you in fights, which is the whole focus of the game.  The worst is the stealth system, hearing the constant barrage of comments from enemies who can seemingly hear you through walls is an absolute joke and I couldn't see any reason to try and pick anyone's pocket or try a stealthy approach when killing and looting is easy and straightforward.  There is way too much clutter around the place, most of it useless or irrelevant. By the end of the game I had 400 unused stim-packs and a mountain of junk. It would have been much better if items were rare and more associated with quests in the game. And the crafting stations around the world seemed totally pointless when you were forced to store your mountain of loot back at the base because it was too heavy to carry around.  So much of the content in the game feels like a waste of time, protecting and building at settlements for instance, why bother when you can just go kill some enemies and sell their weapons for caps. And most of the perks are terrible, if you max out commando and heavy weapons expert you get double damage and stagger on heavy and automatic weapons which make you virtually invincible.  By the end of the game my defence rating in power armour was 1900, and I had a maxed out Final Judgement gatling laser with 100 cores which is the equivalent of 50000 ammo and I was fighting what was supposed to be boss characters who had a single armour item giving them a 50 defence rating and a laser pistol, which meant that they all died more or less instantly and barely made a mark on me. Even the ones in power armour only seemed to last a few seconds.  Finally the storyline, I wanted to achieve world peace however the game put me into a situation where whichever path I chose seemed to result in my character having no problem with killing civilians or characters I had previously been friendly with  to achieve somewhat sketchy goals.  Nice try but it felt more like a sandbox world experiment than a polished game ready for sale, people need to start realising with these games that too much freedom means too many flaws and that basic standards for glitches and game mechanics should never be overlooked.  The sandbox element can easily ruin a game when you can complete difficult quests early, get the most powerful items and then find that most of the remaining game content gives you useless items and is too easy to be fun or relevant..… Expand "

I enjoyed the game play a lot more than I have enjoyed it in other Fallout games, the guns are fun and responsive and actually usable without VATS, though VATS is fun too. The weapon modding is well done and does a lot to vary the game play. The base-building is a strange aspect that I did, kind of, enjoy. I liked being able to make my own little fort but I cannot understand why it was included above other aspects like a more engaging story or better running engine. Speaking of the engine, it is unacceptable that Bethesda still makes modern games on an engine that has been stressed to it's breaking point. The load times and frame rates do not represent the visual quality that the game presents, the game looks decent in general but many aspects of the game are below standard or downright ugly. The main story was decent but not exactly the gripping story telling that I would expect from a Bethesda RPG, the side quests were arguably more fun and I especially enjoyed the idea of factions like the institute, Brotherhood of Steel, etc. though I wish there was more of that in the game. However, the  RPG elements are extremely lacking, very little you do or say will truly change anything apart from the major changes in the main story or certain side quests. The AI is buggy and annoying, but it didn't significantly detract from the overall experience, it was just disappointing and distracting. The open world is what I most enjoyed, it has a lot to explore and do, the post-war Boston landscape is interesting enough for me to wander around on my own time, just to see what I could find. The music is great and I especially loved Diamond City Radio. As for UI it was lacking and kind of annoying, having to scroll through a long list of items on the tiny pip-boy screen is interesting but ultimately becomes a nuisance. Overall, Fallout 4 is an enjoyable experience, even for all of its many flaws, and I did enjoy it and would recommend it only if you would enjoy the combat, exploration, and question, not for the RPG elements or a gripping main story line.… Expand "

Now back to Fallout 4 the opposite is true, once the exactment had passed I along with most fans realised the steps backwards, Skills & Perks are merged into one reducing player playstyles, not to mention all too often there aren't multiple ways to solve problems beyond speech check or the use of your guns, settlement building provides a fun way for creating a deeper connection to the world as you build your own home, and you can create settlements each with their own styles if you so wish, though all too often settlements need your babysitting as they seem unable to defend themselves even though you built a wall armed with rocket & laser turrets.  The addition of a voiced protagonist is a completely unnecessary one, firstly it reduces the players connection to their character and the game world, as lines of dialog are spoken in a way I did not intend for them to be said, in the Vault 88 DLC there's a speech check which I was taking the situation seriously but the voice actor said it like he was joking or being smug this disconnects me from the world reducing my role playing experience as I feel less in control of my character  Some minor SPOILERS here. The core focus of the story is Institute & their Synth, and no where shows just how much of a lack of effort was made to explain and add to the lore than the information surrounding them, it is unclear how Synths are made and function, for a long while I was lead to believe that all Synth have a Synth component (SC) and that was a key part in how they function, but it seem that some synths don't have them leading to speculation that the SC is only in synths that travel to the surface, other speculation includes do synths need to eat, drink, or sleep and just how many bad to good things has the Institute done and its not made clear what their end goal is.  This when coupled with the cut content some of which was shown the trailers (Combat Zone) show that the game could of done with another 4-6 months to really flesh out the story/lore and indeed correct lore contradictions that are made in the game namely Jet and XO1 power Armor.  Fallout 4 will go down as the Fallout game of missteps by Bethesda Skill/Perks, Voiced PC, Lore mistakes or full on retcons, lacking features that seem like the logical addtion like a Armor & weapon stand for those settlements you build so you can show off you treasures from the wastes, even after launch features like survival mode were poorly designed, and only catered to the most hardcore players, where as the average player doesn't want to not be able to save whenever they like, or have to take 2x damage from enemy's over the normal difficulty 1x damage, the devs couldn't even get this right.  Overall Fallout is a fun but ultimately and step backwards in the Bethesda RPG franchise and gives me concern for Elder Scrolls 6 especially when they make games like Fallout 76 that the majority of fans don't want.  Bethesda need to remember their making games for their millions of fans not the millions on non-fans.… Expand "

Clenmila,"Sep 10, 2016",6," After playing the outer worlds I just cant help but feel this games story and world building is very 2 dimensional. How is it that obsidian can make a game and story from scratch, with a smaller team and still make a better game than any fallout game bethesda ever made. Also with very few bugs might I add. "
Lee_Bale,"Sep 26, 2016",7," The game is way more polished than Fallout 3 and Bethesda does what it does best here. The open world is beautifully done and gunplay is more fluid and realistic. However, the developers decided to make Fallout 4 more into a first-person shooter with RPG elements than into an RPG.

If I were a fan of the original two Fallouts, I would be pissed as hell by this game. Gameplay is dumbed down in almost every aspect, Bethesda learned almost nothing from Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas. The dialog system has been raped and adding a voiced main character makes it almost impossible to role play. Do you want to be a violent psychopath who disses everybody and everything? Too bad, you're either a former soldier who cares about kids or a law school graduate who cares about kids. This game features the most streamlined and forgettable quests I've ever seen in an RPG. It's a few months since I've last played it and I don't remember a single one. Can't Bethesda hire a few professional writers, since even their biggest fans admit that their quests suck? Just look at what CD Project Red did with The Witcher 3. This is I think the most frustrating thing about this game: the fact that Bethesda has given up on innovation in these aspects. I really hope that they will do something better with Starfield and The Elder Scrolls 6.… Expand "

I have had to restart many, many times because of game-breaking bugs that can occur without you even noticing until you've already put in tens of hours.  What it does right If there's one thing in Fallout 4 I personally found worthwhile, it'd be the settlement system. I really enjoyed the base-building mechanics and occasional raids. It reminds me of those old tower defense flash games I used to play on Armorgames. On top of that, I also think Fallout 4 has the best weapon/armor customization I've ever seen in a game.

The dialogue options are very limited, as is your ability to play a character like you want -- **** or saint. With the extremely high bar that New Vegas set (and that wasn't even by the same people as this game), this game could honestly only disappoint on that front. Not only that, but there is no ""END"" to this game. As soon as you complete the last mission for what ever faction you've chosen, the game allows you to continue on. There aren't any end title cards, no ""Where are they now"" for your companions...Nothing. That was one of the best parts of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, seeing how your actions affected the people you encountered. I guess they dropped them in this game because you're now making a new life in this wasteland and your actions haven't caused your death or ""sealed your fate""...except they have, at least regarding the latter.  The fact that you have quite a few colorful companions to accompany you on your journey, and the fact that they are romanceable by you regardless of gender, is a plus for me since I am Bisexual and kind of laissez faire with the whole 'who do you love' sort of deal, but it is admittedly a shallow system: There aren't any indicators that the characters acknowledge your sex and how that plays into a relationship, because it is important despite this being a postnuclear apocalypse...But anyway.

If we compare the 3 part and 4, then the difference is heaven and earth. Well, if you compare it with the Witcher, then yes, there are gaps in the graphics, but you can’t compare the cards. In this map you will not find grasses and trees in 90% of cases. This is a depressing post-apocalyptic place, not a walk in the woods. 2) Change in pumping. Now you do not need to pump each skill up to 100 points in order to master one ability. Now you can see what skill is needed for your passage. 3) Mini-bosses. Previously, there were only story bosses, and then in the third part they did not differ from ordinary mobs. Now they exist, are separately marked with an asterisk and give a pretty good item after killing, whether it be a weapon or armor. They are not easy to kill, as if you are trying to destroy the death claw (more on that later), and it's interesting.  Minuses: 1) Sims. This is an optional matter, okay 1 time I will do a mission with ""sims"". You can ignore one minetman with terribly annoying missions with the liberation of the territory. But, just walking around, you see a small town with enemies and you think ""Hmm, I'm not averse to farming."" Killed the cheliks, took the loot and you see this red bandura. And God forbid that you press on him and this town is yours. And what to do with it? Well, yes, you can quit, but the place for farming is shrinking and you want to shoot. There is with 1 mission with a town of inhabitants. Complete the sidequest on 1 of the endings and you will get the city. WHY DO I DO THIS? AND WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT? I DON'T WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE MUHOSRANSK. 2) NPS. There are well-designed mobs, and there are dumb ones. Deathclaw is no exception. DEATH CLAW. THE MOST TOUGHEST MOB IN THE GAME, EVEN THE BOSSES CANNOT BE COMPARED TO IT. And he is afraid of water... That's real. Climbed into the river and he lost you. Okay, in a closet in which he does not crawl. This is still understandable. But water... 3) Bug partners.

Первое впечатление у меня было неоднозначным, казалось что это будет личная история главного героя, у которого отняли всё. Но ближе к середине, история стала глобальнее в разы, так как появились старые и новые знакомые в лице крупных фракций, которые придерживаются собственной идеологии. Конечно они испортили Братство стали, испортили в разы. Вместо суровой организации с практически полной секретностью, Bethesda сделала Братство как Fallout 3, только ещё хуже. Институт был придуман ещё во времена Fallout 3, там ему даже квест посвящён, но речь не о тех прекрасных временах, а о наших суровых временах и в них Институт не плох, но проходить за него игру я не стал, мне больше по душе Братство и Минитмены, за которых и я и прошёл игру. Минитмены отличная организация, мне она по душе сильнее всех остальных, организация со своими идеями и порядком. А вот Подземка меня разочаровала, я ожидал что они будут иметь при себе тайных информаторов в институте, но таковых я там увы не встретил, в остальном они какие-то бомжи из подвала церкви защищающие синтов. Сюжет здесь не сильно изменился в отличии от Fallout 3, просто поменяли местами сына и отца и добавили 4 сюжетных линии за 4 выше названные фракции. Прокачка стала хуже чем в Fallout 3, это система прокачки из какой нибудь Dragon Age, но никак не из Fallout.Квесты стали лучше чем в Fallout 3, но хуже чем в моём любимом Fallout: New Vegas. Есть реально интересные, а есть и квесты по типу убей врагов там и принеси вот это, такие задания порой очень бесят, они подходят для ММО, но никак не для RPG 2015 года. И да, в Fallout 4 должен был быть мультиплеер, но от него отказались. Персонажи, а особенно напарники стали глубже и интереснее, огромный шаг в сравнении с Fallout 3, но маленький шаг назад в сравнении с New Vegas, это касается и квестов напарников. Со звуком точно такая-же история.А вот что стало лучше в сравнении с New Vegas: графика, стрельба, дизайн уровней, противников и мира. Стрелять удобно, пушки ощущаются очень реалистично. Графика не супермегахит, но лучше чем в New Vegas. Мир выглядит разнообразным не только благодаря дизайнерам, но и благодаря тому что Bethesda убрала цветовой фильтр в мусорное ведро и правильно сделала, он резал глаза в Fallout 3 и Fallout New Vegas.

uwuseless,"Oct 23, 2021",4," After Fallout 3, there was a game called Fallout: New Vegas. It was critically acclaimed because it had really good writing. People looked past its many flaws; glitches, a consequence of Bethesda asking Obsidian to make the game in an afternoon, very ugly graphics for the time and not very fun combat. People looked past these flaws because the writing of the game was that good. EvenAfter Fallout 3, there was a game called Fallout: New Vegas. It was critically acclaimed because it had really good writing. People looked past its many flaws; glitches, a consequence of Bethesda asking Obsidian to make the game in an afternoon, very ugly graphics for the time and not very fun combat. People looked past these flaws because the writing of the game was that good. Even today, Fallout: New Vegas keeps a healthy 8.7 user score on this very website. However, Fallout 4 does not enjoy that luxury.  Why is there such a large discrepancy between critic and audience scores? It's not because critics are out of touch idiot dumdums who are nitpicking and biased, but rather because their job is to literally put out a review. They can't do that one year after the game comes out, can they? I would reckon most critics put out their review within the first month of playing a game. And while that might be more than enough time to get through Resident Evil 2 or Super Mario Galaxy, it's not enough time to get through Fallout 4. I currently have circa 100 hours in the game, which I would consider very little, compared to my playtime for some other Bethesda RPGs and other Fallout games. This is still probably more time than what critics spent with it in the few weeks between the distribution of review copies and the lifting of the embargo, and most certainly more time than most of the 10/10 user reviews, that were written within 3 days of the game's release.  What does this mean?  It means this game that's been advertised as a vast and immersive timesink is being mostly judged by people who haven't even played it that much, and that inflates its review score to hell and back.  Bethesda ruined the dialogue in a game that heavily relies on dialogue. Bethesda turned a game series that is known for deeply funny and interesting quests into a factory of ""another settlement needs your help"" quests.  Bethesda fundamentally doesn't understand what makes their good games good and fun.  In Fallout 4, a game advertised as an RPG, you play as Nate, a middle-aged wisecracking war veteran, or Nora, a middle-aged wisecracking wife of a war veteran. You are driven by one thing and one thing only, rescuing your son, whose name I remember starts with an S.  Your character has the most vanilla voice actor Bethesda came across, who either has no emotion or all the emotions, and no in-between.  The objective of the game is to find your son, and help settlements along the way. There are branching paths, and your character has mostly figured out how to be an independent, self-driven person, which is a large improvement from the ""hey lone wanderer, go here, because your dad went this way"" mentality of Fallout 3. It's still ""I'm going to go there because my son could have gone that way"" but it's better than being told what to do. Credit where credit is due.  There are some branching paths in the story, similarly to New Vegas, but unfortunately there is very little in the way of consequences for your actions.  The game leaves very little room for roleplaying beyond the most basic ""will you be a good guy,,, or a dick"" moral decisions. There are in fact more personalities beyond good guy and dick, and Bethesda doesn't seem to be aware of this.  The quests are boring. The fact that you have a hard time telling radiant quests and regular, written quests isn't as much a testament to the amazing talent Bethesda has for making great radiant quest systems but more proof that their ""real"" quests are very bland and cookie cutter.  This would all be fine if Bethesda finally decided to make a polished game, with fun combat. These would be flaws that people would look past. But that is not the case. The combat is boring and not engaging. The novelty of the VATS system has worn off. Every gun feels like a pea shooter. If you increase the difficulty, enemies don't get smarter AI as much as they get health buffs. And shooting at a guy twice is way more fun than shooting at them once.  The game gives you power armour and lets you kill a deathclaw in its very beginning (or what would be the beginning if you could get past the 2-hour intro that Bethesda insists on putting in every Fallout game and that literally no one in the world likes) seemingly to make you feel like a badass and establish that the game won't make any effort to teach through dying or reward you for effort.  Speaking of which, can we talk about the intro? What a way to set the tone! It's very frank and honest about what the game is: a linear corridor disguised as an open world, with the most boring characters in the world and nothing interesting to do. A chore.  That's what this game is. A chore to play. And I'd like to say this review is a call to action for Bethesda, but I just don't believe they can make a good Fallout game, because they seem to fundamentally misunderstand Fallout. I hope this incompetence doesn't bleed to Elder Scrolls VI or Starfield.… Expand "

Whats even more disappointing is the branching endings of the main story line. You choose between 3 factions, all with their own takes on synths. Personally, I didnt really care. Even though your son is involved, you just dont feel compelled to care.  The engine is terrible, runs like crap and looks even worse Bethesda needs to throw this trash away ASAP.

War never changes, but neither does my enjoyment of the Fallout game series. Here are some points of the game as I see it.  -This game has a very enjoyable storyline, side stories and everything we already know about Fallout games, as well as an interesting romance delivery, though not anything to write home about, aside from the enjoyment to get to know your companions. They are all enjoyable. You can easily get lost in side stories and find yourself forgetting where you left off on the main story, by choice.  -The radio seems annoying at first, but gets better as you go. However, the companions are a huge step up, more involved, more interesting, and I already liked the previous. Each companion is worth taking around for a time, just to enjoy their personally stories and comments, so, do not linger on one companion for too long.  -The crafting system in this game is very simple, and yet, it has tedious complexities. You have many options, but holding onto old mods for the next weapon has yet to prove useful. -This is the first Fallout that introduces settlements, and despite the issues, I enjoy it very much. You can setup turrets, alarms, traps, and even arm and armor your settlers. This part of the game is completely optional, but I am thoroughly enjoying it.  With so many positive things of the game, it is important to know the negative too.  -Save often. I run on a beast of a pc. As such, I have very limited issues, from what I have read of some others experiencing. However, I have crashed twice, both times losing anything done from the last manual save. The auto save seems to be lost, or so it was on mine. I only lost about 10 minutes, as I save about every 15 minutes or sooner.  -Settlement building can being very frustrating at first, but with patience it is not so bad. It really depends on how much time you want to sink into it. I have seen many that go crazy and create cities instead, and I have seen some that just make a shack. I am in the middle somewhere, though I might find myself expanding on the settlement later. Myth busting negative reviews and comments that I have seen.  -Stealth is not broken. I have seen one even post a video to prove it, and he was crouched but still running, not walking. Without points put into your skill for that, running crouched is easily detected. I use this often to get them to come around the corner and pop them off into a trap, or wander into my mines. Stealth works great when you use it properly.  -Items will not stay where you put them. Not sure if this was fixed in a patch or not, but as long as you place the items, junk or trophies, while in settler building mode (hold down 'V' to enter this) then those items do not fall through the floor or get lost. If you do not use this method, it is a mess.  -You need a lot of power to use a lot of lights. This is one a friend told me and showed me a guide on. You do not need anything more than access to power to power anything that does not have a number next to the lightning bolt. If it requires and uses your max limit of power from your generators in your settlements, then it will have a number showing how much it will consume to be active.  -The game is too easy. Put the game on a much harder difficulty, play survival mode, do not cheat. I haven't found the game overly easy by any means.  Overall, this game is definitely worth the price, and I do recommend the season pass, however, getting it on sale is of course the best of choices.… Expand "

Mjolkurferna,"Nov  9, 2019",7," I have a deep love/hate relationship with this game. As a long time Fallout fan and someone who grew up with the 3rd Fallout game I had high expectations from Fallout 4. While those expectation were not met, Fallout 4 is not a bad game. As time has passed, I've begun to appreciate some of the aspects of the game while also being a bit disappointed about the missed potential of it.  Pros:I have a deep love/hate relationship with this game. As a long time Fallout fan and someone who grew up with the 3rd Fallout game I had high expectations from Fallout 4. While those expectation were not met, Fallout 4 is not a bad game. As time has passed, I've begun to appreciate some of the aspects of the game while also being a bit disappointed about the missed potential of it.  Pros: - Gunplay and combat has vastly been improved from other Fallout titles. - New settlement system. - Perks. - Character customization and voice acting. - Soundtrack is still same old Fallout.  Mixed: - Quests and story can be hit or miss for some people. Personally I found it bland, while the DLC's offered better quests (Far Harbor). - Graphics, some people liked the improvements while other expected more. - Companions. While I liked most of the companions, there was some missing character development for most of them and with time they offered nothing but help in combat. - Exploration, not bad by any means but can feel a bit empty at times.  Cons: - RPG elements are lacking. - Quests or actions no longer have skill point requirements (There was one quest with this feature and that person who worked on that quest worked on the older games). - Dialogue option is a joke and offers you false sense of choice. - The settlement system is pretty shallow once you get into it (needs more late game stuff).  Overall, Fallout 4 excels more at being an action shooter instead of a classic action role-playing game. You can put a lot of hours into this game and by no means is it bad. If you are a Fallout fan and loved the older titles, you might have to look past some of the flaws to get more engaged with the game.  Verdict - 7/10.… Expand "

""Bethesda tries to learn from Obsidian Enterainment and create Mortal engines of Philip Reeve""  Well, this Fallout is full of something good in its atmosphere. Yes, its still a post-apocalypse game. Its world still look destructed and damaged as it should be.  1) Combat - F4 is not Escape from Tarkov. However, its drastically much realistic then previous Fallouts. Yes i cant play F1-2 because its combat system thats is even not a 1/10 arrow in the knee.  The best thing - if you come to medium size raiders base without power-armor or consistent standard armor, you're 50% dead. Thats just awesome, awesome as uncensored. Even New Vegas was not so real. In F3 and FNV you was able to kick back of most of the enemies by low-level rifle without serios gear.  2) Storyline, Characters, Factions, Atmosphere, etc - time to time F4 is 75-85% of New Vegas quality. Bethesda learned from Obsidian. I appreciate it and respect Bethesda and Obsidian. Previously, Fallout 3 was a kindergarten for 10 year children. Seriously, i was not able to play F3 because of too childish atmosphere. Meanwhile i love New Vegas. New Vegas is one of the best RPG.  The F4 atmosphere is about something like Philip Reeve books. Fallout 4 dont make me nervous as ""The 100"" able to do, but its still interestiing. On the contrary, finally, its  made me relax. Im calm after i turn off the game and thats drastically great. There is still intrigue, still interesting persons like Piper, Vadim or Deacon, but no fear that ""Kate will die because of the dangerous crazy raider/supermutant with sledgehammer""  Why? Because we are normal persons. We will find two T60/combat armor, then prepare it, buy few Miniguns. Then solve the problems as normal people, not like the drama queens that are diyng just because author need more dolbannaya drama in each chapter of the story.  3) What is realy bad - ""a two mates was traveling from one town to another. In few hours they met deathclaws, rust devils, mechanist's robots, mercenaries, raiders, other mutants, then they find the serios lack of ammo. Their armor were smashed to dust."". Im tired of this. Thats just... economically and demographically unjustified.  How many raiders were born? Where is all thoose farms that are able to feed the hordes of criminals? How many deathclaw eggs were born? How many robots were made by mechanist? F4 is not a wasteland, F4 is endless Verdun meat grinder - where is all thoose industry plants that are made the divisions of enemies? Im tired of killing this poor guys that i met on the Commonwealth roads.  Fallout New Vegas was much more real than F4 in case of economics and demography.  4) Dialoge system is normal. There was not a very rich dialoge trees in F3/NV, so... mods are solve the problems with pre-view of your words. Its fine  5) In my opinion its good game as for 21 years old me, as for my future kids. I will show them F4, yes. meanwhile, i will never recommend them that... Call of Duty and other facepalm games  TOTAL: I love Fallout 4, but - only 8/10 is fair What Penalties: -1 because of economics, demography -1 to be honest, there is something that should be more serious in post-apocalypse.

I really do not get why people still think that Fallout New Vegas is the better game? I played that and it sucks balls. The FO New Vegas controls are clunky you cannot sprint or run and cannot craft as many things. Combat is far better in the FO 4 game compared to FO3 and NV. In fact playing FO New Vegas recently for comparison makes me cringe at how bad the older FO games really are compared to FO 4. Hopefully FO 5 is even better!… Expand

The game is also very grindy thanks to radiant quests, the constant need for ammo and an overreliance on crafting.  Overall though, if you’re a fan of the world of Fallout and you enjoyed Fallout 3 there’s a good chance you’ll like this one too.

Only PROS: It actually runs on day-one, unlike other games (*cough* Batman: Arkham Knight *cough*)  Here are the MAIN problems briefly:  -Graphics out of a 2000's game. Sometimes they are so badly done they look cartoonish, like Telltale's Walking Dead/Wolf Among Us. -Nice that everything is voiced, however you are limited to 4 answers per dialogue including the classic (Witty, Kind, Evil, No ty) - How innovative! -You basically get the Power Armor 15 minutes into the game, taking any challenge out of it. -No real Survival theme. More like a First Person Shooter -The towns are tiny. Even the supposingly ""Jewel"" of the game, the big, main settlement - Diamond City, is as small as Dawnstar in Skyrim...and feels like its been rushed - like a copy-paste of megaton from Fallout 3. -Still use the same weird ""hacking"" of computer terminals in which you have to guess 4-5 times and then wait to try again. -Skill not high enough? Forget trying. Unlike Skyrim in which you could ATTEMPT to break a Master lock (even with level 1 lockpicking), in Fallout 4 you simply are locked from doing so if you don't have the appropriate perk unlocked.  -Dialogues are plain childish - no imagination or creative thinking behind them. -Story is boring and uninteresting. Nothing that makes me want to investigate and find out what is going on (bad graphics add to that). -On dialogues, now you can fully be in 3rd person and look around. However, the camera goes nuts and shows blank walls, or it fully zooms on NPC's hair, etc.  -Holstered weapons dissapear - nothing at your sides. -Enemies get stuck, jump around, run in T-pose. Quest NPCs bug and roam to places unknown, making quests unable to complete.  -No RPG soul in it. More like an FPS like CoD. -Landscapes are simply bad. Nothing breath-taking like Skyrim - hell, I could just sit in front of a river and watch the scenery in Skyrim! -Wax museum character models - although character creation looks dope, the poor graphic quality and the same base, copy-pasted face for NPCs ruins it all. ALSO: Bethesda didn't even bother changing the hand meshes. Play Male or Female character, your hands use the same (male) model. I played 10 minutes on my female character accidentally this morning, and I realized it when I went 3rd person that I play a female. The hands textures are the same FOR CHRIST SAKE.  -You need three hands to play (REALLY? WASD, MOUSE, AND ARROWS? SERIOUSLY BETHESDA?) -Keyboard keys are hardcoded, for example you can't switch the F-key back to 1st/3rd person like it was in Skyrim - forcing you to use ""V""  More, but it's adding to the inevitable: Let's hope that the modding community can fix this mess.… Expand "

Here's my honest opinion into the Good & Bad points of FO4...  ------------    THE GOOD    No level cap.  AIThe first time I played FO4, I didn't like it. I put it aside for nearly a year. I didn't think I'd ever play it again. However, after the huge disappointment with FO76, and the Steam Version of FO3 being a broken mess, I decided to give FO4 another chance. Eh... it's...OK. Here's my honest opinion into the Good & Bad points of FO4...  ------------  THE GOOD  No level cap. AI intelligence is pretty good. Great leveling and perk system. Skill books are interesting. Pre-War start is epic. Nice crafting system. Lots of lore reading. Dynamic weather system.  ------------  THE BAD  Main Story is complete garbage. Exploration is not up to par with FO3. Occasional bugs/glitches/crashes. Graphics are good, but could be better. The DLC (more about that below). Repetitive settlement building. Companions are stupid; even dogmeat. Best to solo. Limited dialogue options and player choices. Survival Mode is unbalanced and unrealistic.  ------------  My favorite part of the game is the Pre-War start. Having your character in game in 2077 before the bombs fall, and then returning 210 years later in 2287 is EPIC! Seriously, what a great concept and Bethesda executed it beautifully.  I also love the weather system. Rad storms are no joke. Make sure you carry Rad-X and RadAway.  More about the DLC.. IMHO, only ""Far Harbor"" and ""Automatron"" are worth getting. The others are mediocre at best.  As many have stated, it's not a ""true"" Fallout game. It's more of a shooter with RPG elements. Sad.  The settlement building is really boring, repetitive and tedious. Also, many settlements are forced on you rather you want them or not. But... thank God, you can ignore most of them, and just leave them to their fate.  The lack of dialogue and players choices through that dialogue is what killed the game for many people. Some of them quests, you have no choice but to accept, and not only that, be a NICE guy/gal.  As for the story, well... aside from that Epic pre-war start, I didn't really care for an already made family, and then trying to feel sorry for a dead spouse and kidnapped baby. I mean you knew them for what, 5 minutes? The player character should have been single as they were in the previous games. The end game was just horrid. Very disappointing. Not enough options or choices.  So... Fallout 4 is an OK game, but is certainly not up to par with FO3 or New Vegas. I think a rating of 6 is about right, and is more than generous. Hopefully FO5 will return to its old roots and gives us an epic game. If not, I'd say Fallout is dead. This and 76 has ruined the series. Sad but true. Cheers!… Expand "

The requirement to kill all the other factions if you side with one is really annoying and some kind of mechanic where you could make them coexist would have been a lot better. But still it was a very good experience. I spend over 70 hours in the commonwealth.… Expand "
Muzketin,"May 17, 2022",1, Only mods can save this horrible title. The mod community did a better job than the developers. How lame.

What level of amateur programming is this? - Absolutely shtty tutorial, in the first playthrough I didn't know what VATS and never used it can you believe it? Because they never told you how to trigger it, or maybe it did with a 3-second laughable text prompt. - Abysmal open-world programming. The developer just wasn't paying enough attention. They do have in mind how they want you to play, so if you don't follow their expectation, you'll get hilarious bugs.  I hoped that they would remake this game, but given that it's Bethesda, they would only break this game. So never mind.… Expand "
jonu86,"Dec 17, 2021",8," Great atmosphere, good gameplay (except for rather unnecessary base building) and decent story. For me, I don't need any role-playing features. "
Mikey01,"Mar  2, 2022",9," I really like this fallout chapter, everything is very nice, even if in some ways I find the grinding annoying in regards to the camps, but it's my problem "
LambdaLocator,"Mar 15, 2022",7," A downgrade from previous games, but I still had a lot of fun with the combat and the open world. "
Chillaoi,"Mar 20, 2022",3," Review só pra lembrar a nota que dei pro jogo: Meu Deus, se eu ver a brotherhood of steel em mais um jogo de fallout eu vou virar o coringa, de resto: ""Gun play"" é a melhor da série, boa comunidade de mods (assim como todo jogo da bethesda), diálogos e história horripilantes e DLC's ruins. "
nadeauhugo,"Mar 22, 2022",5," Fantastic world building, great gameplay and combat, good sense of exploration, fun crafting features, but the dialogues are very underwelming, the choices are disappointing and the story sucks. Also, trying to avoid combat is a lost cause in that game. "
Asparz,"Mar 23, 2022",9," A game that has new and better things although I understand that it needs some dlc with other stories as in fallout new vegas, better I mean because there are half **** but it is a game in which I have more hours, more than in fallout new vegas, and the mods is good that they want to make the game realistic or something like that but there are already many and bored a lot.

xXPr0Gam3rXx,"Apr 19, 2022",10," I can't believe Bethesda paid money to buy right for this dead-beat franchise with PS1 graphics top-down games, like it's nintendo or something.

whoisbre,"May 11, 2022",5," This could be a good game if it wasn't called ""Fallout"".  Both ""Fallout 3"" and ""Skyrim"" are great games. ""Fallout 4"" doesn't have anything in common but the bad Engine. "
zcat5,"May 11, 2022",9," This game brings the core elements from New Vegas and Fallout 3, but it takes the game in a completely new direction with the addition of the settlement building system. The mods alongside the settlement system result this game being the best overall Fallout game of the series. "
Sepru,"May 25, 2022",8, 2nd best Fallout game because the choices are very limited and there are many game breaking bugs like an NPC just doesnt talks to you in a quest and you cant finish that quest. Other than that the game is very above an average game and made improvements in every way to Fallout 3. 
BigBoyBigPloy,"Jun  6, 2022",8," The game still runs poorly but the content and mod support is what saves it for me. It feels like it's a step down from Skyrim in terms of optimization.

The added things you can also get with mods really bump the game up. If there was no support for mods and I could only play the vanilla version, then this would be a 6/10 maybe a light 7.  I also don't feel as excited to explore as much I as did in previous Bethesda games. For me personally, the empty and dead wasteland isn't an appealing thing to explore. My sense of wonder is gone and I stick to quests and maybe some settlement building to have fun. Whereas with previous BGS titles, I could mess around the world doing anything and still have fun. Hours could go by and I wouldn't have done a single quest, I'd just be exploring and finding whatever shenanigans I could get myself into.  All in all, I would recommend this game but I would recommend getting it on PC. Just so you have full access to any mods like in Nexus mods, and not limited to the select mods that Bethesda has greenlit through creation club on consoles. I would be hesitant to recommend this title in it's vanilla form.… Expand "

Guskica,"Dec 22, 2017",9," Nice graphics and gameplay. The story was a bit weird but it was still nice. Didn't know it was RPG when I first got it but fell in love with the genre ever since I played this game, same goes for the music on the radio. Can't wait to try the mods. "
